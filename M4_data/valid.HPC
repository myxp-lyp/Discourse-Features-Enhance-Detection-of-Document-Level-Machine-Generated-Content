\n You see, both Entei and Raikou will just escape from a battle whenever you try to catch them. Through work, however, you can beat them. Here's a way that has successfully worked. \n In this tutorial we will go after Entei. Some attempt to go after two at a time but it doesn't work nearly as well as simply choosing one and sticking to it. \n It's recommended to do this at night *game wise, not real-world *, as this means you can use both Ultra Balls and Dusk Balls. \n). \n After finding Entei this is automatic. \n You should only do this one. There are also few other Pokémon you can use to catch Entei. \n It won't take much damage, and it heals itself anyway with it's item, 'Leftovers'. \n It isn't tricky to capture, but it takes a few encounters before you can catch it. \n You can't find it by searching your PokeGear. Instead, you have to encounter it several times in order to finally capture it (you don't need Snorlax for this one). \n Suicune is at the north of this island. As always, it will vanish but Ensuine (Pokémon fanatic who is also after Suicune) will battle you. \n Mortar. You should be able to surf west a bit and find a tree you can cut. It will lead you to a small grove with three tree with berries in the middle. Suicune will be there. \n Suicune will be there on the port leading off of the S.S. Aqua. \n It's towards Route 13. \n Suicune won't run away from the battle, so Snorlax is not needed. Suicune is level 40 just like Raikou and Entei. \n
 He'll introduce himself as Big Nate. The island is named after him! He asks you if you knew about the time capsule.\n Talk to him and he will tell you he has some pieces of a comic he wants to read and he will give you a reward if you find them. \n Go to the highest floor and under the couch is your first comic piece. \n Talk to the man, who says he has scuba gear for trading, and then go to the light to the right of the entrance and you will find the comic piece. \n The look at the lost poster of the dog. It says the dog likes peanut butter crackers. Keep that in mind. \n Then go to the second floor and into the Science Lab. \n Grab both the comic piece and the black and white photo. Ask the man to look through his telescope. Go to the right and you'll see a piece of paper under two rocks. \n Arrange them and you will find writing on the the comic. It should say 9305. \n He is happy and lets you keep it and gives you some bubble gum. \n Add a tiny bit of red chemical and turn the heat on to 4. You get a stink bomb! \n It will knock you over. Go to the pile of stuff on the floor and you get a school blueprint. Examine it and you find out there is a secret door in the Detention Room. Go next to the sign that says NO GUM CHEWING and chew your gum. The Detention Lady comes out and you go into detention. \n Then go down the secret door. It is in the filing cabinet. Turn on the light, talk to Artur and grab the bell clapper. \n He has a lobster trap under the water. Put on your scuba gear and dive. Get the lobster trap and get up. Give it back to Captain Salty and he gives you the lobster and keys to his jet ski.. Go to the floor on top of the telescope man and use your lobster to turn the light. You see the bird leave the bell. Go to the playground and talk to the girls who ignore you. \n Nate races you. Jump your jet ski every 3 seconds so you can avoid obstacles. \n Then go back. Examine your paper and it is the map for the time capsule. It is where the girls are standing. \n The girls go inside. \n It is pretty much Hangman but with Poptropica characters. Once you win, Nate gives you expired peanut butter crackers. \n Use these where the girls were standing. You will find the time capsule! Click and drag it out. You find a pearl and you save the school! You get a newspaper and of course, it has to be under Nate's name. Make sure it's under the name. \n Congrats! You get 100 credits for the store too! Yay! Fun Fact: Click on the frog on the ground and it hops away from you. \n 
 This can pinpoint specific areas for improvement that you can implement over time.\n There's no doubt that your equipment will be subjected to the everyday wear-and-tear. Clean coils and replace air filters regularly for smooth operations. \n While purchasing new equipment may be more expensive than a repair, an energy-efficient model will save you more money in the long term. \n Look for models certified by the government to be energy efficient. In the United States look for the Energy Star rating, which indicates that a product is environmentally friendly and will help consumers save money on energy costs. \n This will help cut down on cooling costs. \n Adding side panels to oven hoods and making sure each appliance is flush against the wall can help in kitchen ventilation. \n Leaving kitchen equipment on but idle expends energy and drives up your bill. \n Turn off unnecessary lights or keep lights dim if possible. This can save up to 75 percent in energy and heat output. \n For example, choose an oven over a rotisserie or a griddle over a broiler. \n Perform a frequent check of the thermostats of your commercial kitchen appliances and then reset them as needed. \n A tall, yellow flame will indicate too much gas while a bullet-shaped blue flame will be just right. \n Use the night-time setting for additional energy savings. \n 
 You don’t want to be that guy that is “high-beaming” everyone! The factory does have a good tolerable level; let’s keep it that way when you’re done! If you can get 10-20’ is best & record the top of the beam measurement & distance from measuring wall.\n A 21mm socket is needed, as well as a fair amount of force. These are tight! \n This requires a 21mm box-end and a 10mm box-end wrench to keep the ball end from spinning. Lift the tie-rod end high and rest on the raised sway-bar ends.,(6) \n You need to ensure the spindle will not over-extend outward. You should be able to just lift by hand to separate ball-joint from spindle. If it is tight, whack the top of the steering knuckle (spindle) (10) with a hammer. The vibration will separate the press fit., Then remove the loosened upper bolts and slide out the entire assembly., On the upper bearing mount, you will notice a “flat” side of the triangular mount. This goes toward the engine on both sides. The adjustment knob goes towards the front for easy access & not to interfere with the drive-shafts. Position 5 is a good place to start; you can fine tune later if required. \n Hit some bumps & curves & let the system settle., Headlight adjustment requires a Torx T20 bit. \n 
 You can choose from different color LED lights that will be powered by the solar energy you are collecting. Once you've decided, purchase all the items, listed under the Things You'll Need.\n Familiarize yourself with the parts as this will make it easier for you to build the lantern. \n A good recommended length to work with is 3 inches or just a bit longer for all the black and red wires. This ensures you have enough length to re-strip the wires as well. \n To do this, insert the newly cut end you just cut into the number 18 size stripping hole below where the cutting blade is on the wire stripper/cutter. Only strip about 1/2in to 3/4in. This will be enough length to tie together in the wire nut. Grip the handles, pull the wire back and the wire stripper should remove the plastic covering the wire. If it doesn't strip, you need to make sure you have the wire in the correct sized hole. \n When pulling back to strip the wire, do not grip the circuit board and pull as this can result in pulling the wire out of the circuit board. Pull by gripping the wire only. \n Install batteries as instructed on battery holder. \n To connect the wires, bring both ends of red wires together, straighten out the exposed wiring so they easily insert into wire nut(the one from the battery charger and the one from the circuit board) and insert the ends with the wire exposed into the wire nut. Twist the wire nut clockwise as if you were tightening. (remember righty tighty, lefty loosey). After you twist clockwise to tighten the wires together, you can pull wire nut off. Your wire ends should be wrapped together creating a secure electrical bond. \n It is very important you connect it to the battery section of the circuit. \n It is very important you connect it to the BATTERY section of the circuit! \n The hole should be large enough for the two black and red wires coming from the solar panel to fit through.The hole should also be made about a 1/2 inches off the edge of the lip of the lid. This will allow the panel to lay flat on the top and will also make sure you can glue the battery holder on the other side of the lid. \n After you twist clockwise to tighten the wires together, you can pull wire nut off. Your wire ends should be wrapped together creating a secure electrical bond. Like steps the previous steps it is important to connect these wires to their correct destination on the circuit board. \n Your LED lights should now be on. They are currently running off the battery power as your circuit board is set to battery as the default mode. If your lights do not come on, check to make sure the tiny switches on the circuit board are in the "on" position which is towards the center of the board. Also check to make sure your wires are all connected properly. \n Apply a small amount of the instant glue to the batteries and press onto the bottom side of the lid. Hold until it stays on its own. \n Apply a small amount of glue to the bottom of the panel (the side that does not look like a grid and has the wires coming out of it) and press and hold the panel to the top of the lid for about a minute. It might not lay completely flat which is okay. Make sure it stays in place though. \n You can now put anything into your mason jar to accessorize your solar lantern. Ideas include - stones, succulent plants, marbles, flower pedals. \n

 Muscle atrophy is the medical term used to denote the condition when a part of the body suffers muscle loss or when muscle tissue wastes away.It’s normal for muscle atrophy to occur as we age, but it can also be a sign of a more serious medical condition, illness, or injury. \n Muscle atrophy can negatively impact a person’s quality of life because they lose strength and mobility, which can make it difficult to perform basic tasks. People with atrophied muscles are also at an increased risk for falling or injuring themselves. Since the heart is also a muscle that can break down, individuals experiencing muscle atrophy face the risk of heart problems.\n Muscles can atrophy from disuse, or when they are not used regularly at an appreciable level of exertion. This disuse causes the muscle tissue to break down, shorten in length, and waste away. This typically occurs as a result of an injury, sedentary lifestyle, or medical condition that prevents a person from exercising his muscles.Disuse muscle atrophy can also result from severe malnourishment. For example, prisoners of war and people suffering from eating disorders such as anorexia may experience muscle loss and the wasting away of muscle tissue. \n People with jobs that require them to be seated for major portions of each work day or people who are not physically active can also experience this type of muscle atrophy. \n Severe injuries such as those to the spinal cord or brain may leave someone bedridden and result in atrophied muscles. Even common injuries such as broken bones or sprains that restrict your ability to move around can also cause disuse muscle atrophy. \n Medical conditions that limit a person’s ability to exercise or be physically active include rheumatoid arthritis, which causes joint inflammation, and osteoarthritis, which weakens the bones. These conditions can make it uncomfortable, painful, or even impossible to exercise, leading to atrophied muscles. \n In many cases of disuse muscle atrophy, the loss of muscle tissue can be reversed by increasing physical exercise. \n Neurogenic muscle atrophy is caused by a disease or injury to the nerves attached to the muscles. It is less common than disuse muscle atrophy, but harder to treat because nerve regeneration usually requires more than increased exercise. Some of the diseases that often lead to neurogenic atrophy include: \n Polio, a viral disease that can cause paralysis. \n Muscular dystrophy, a hereditary disease that weakens the muscles. \n Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, attacks the nerve cells that communicate with and control muscles.Guillain-Barre syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that causes your body’s immune system to attack your nerves, resulting in muscle paralysis and weakness.Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is another autoimmune disease that can immobilize the whole body., It’s important to recognize the symptoms of muscle atrophy early so you can begin treating your condition. Some of the main symptoms include:Muscle weakness and decrease in muscle size. \n Skin around the affected muscle may seem to sag away from the muscle. \n Difficulty lifting things, moving the atrophied area, or doing exercise that was once easy. \n Pain in the affected area. \n Back pain and difficulty walking. \n A feeling of stiffness or heaviness in the affected area. \n The symptoms of neurogenic muscle atrophy can be harder for someone without a medical background to recognize, but some of the more visible symptoms include a stooped posture, a rigid spine, and a limited ability to move the neck. \n If you suspect that you are experiencing muscle atrophy, it’s a good idea to talk with your doctor or a medical professional as soon as possible. They will be able to properly diagnose your condition and provide treatment for the underlying causes.If the reason for muscle deterioration is an illness, your doctor may be able to prescribe medications that will help you maintain your muscle mass or reverse some damage of muscle atrophy. \n Anti-inflammatory medicines such as corticosteroids are sometimes given to patients with muscle atrophy, which helps to reduce inflammation and compression of the affected muscle nerves. This can make exercise and daily activities more comfortable. \n To diagnose muscle atrophy, doctors often use blood tests, X rays, CT scans, EMG scans, MRI scans, and muscle or nerve biopsies. They may also measure muscle tone and reflexes.A doctor will also be able to talk with you about whether any kinds of exercise can stop the loss of muscle tissues or if you need to undergo surgeries and other kinds of treatments. \n Depending on what is causing the muscle atrophy, your doctor might recommend you work with a physical therapist, nutritionist, or a personal trainer who can improve your condition with targeted exercise, diet, and lifestyle changes. \n Even if the doctor did not find that your muscle atrophy is caused by a specific disease, it’s a good idea to talk with your doctor or health provider before attempting to build up atrophied muscles. You don’t want to overdo anything or endanger your health, and your doctor may be able to refer you to a qualified trainer or physical therapist., Though you can do some physical activities on your own to reverse muscle atrophy’s effects, it is always best to have a qualified instructor or trainer to ensure that you are on the right track. \n She will start out by assessing your capabilities and guide you through specific exercises to build muscle in the atrophied areas. She can also gauge your progress and adjust the exercise routine as needed. \n Since many people with atrophied muscles are beginning exercise again after a long break from physical activity, it’s important to start slowly. Remember, your body is not as strong as it was prior to atrophy. \n Swimming and water exercises are often recommended for patients who are trying to recover from muscle atrophy because this form of exercise can dull muscle pain, quickly tone atrophied muscles, rebuild muscle memory, and relax sore muscles. While it’s best to work with an expert, here are a few basic steps to get you started:, With water at hip- to waist-height, try walking around the pool for 10 minutes. This workout is low-risk and helps develop the muscles in the lower part of your body. \n As you progress, increase the time interval and the depth of the water. \n You can also use paddles or water barbells for more resistance. These tools will help work your core and upper body. \n Try a knee lift by positioning your back against the pool wall, and placing both feet flat on the bottom of the pool. Then, lift a knee up as if you are marching in place. When your knee is at hip height, extend it outward. \n Keep doing this for ten repetitions, before switching to the other leg. \n As you progress, try doing additional sets for each leg. \n Face the pool wall with your arms resting on the deck of the pool and shoulder-width apart. Use your hands to raise your body up out of the water so you are about halfway out of the pool. Hold the position for a few seconds and then slowly lower yourself back in the pool. \n For an easier version, place your hands on the pool deck so they are shoulder-width apart. As you bend your elbows, lean your chest toward the wall of the pool. \n If you feel proficient doing exercises in the water, add some body-weight exercises while on dry land. \n A beginner can start with eight to twelve repetitions of the exercise moves mentioned below. These exercises target the major muscle groups. \n Perform this routine three times per week to build up atrophied muscles. \n To perform a squat, stand straight and put both hands forward. Slowly and carefully bend your knees, as if sitting in an imaginary chair. Hold this position for a few seconds before going back to the starting position.Keep your weight on your heels and do not allow your knees to go past your toes. \n To perform lunges, stand up straight with your hands on your hips. Pull your abdominal muscles in.Take a large step forward with your right foot. Keep your back straight while moving forward. Your heel should be raised while the tip of the toe is pressing against the floor. \n Bend both knees at the same time until they both form a 90 degree angle. You can check your position at the mirror to know if you are doing it right. \n Put your heel down and push upwards to stand. Return to the starting position and do all of the above with the left leg. \n Remember that your body should not be slouching forward. \n To do a triceps dip, prepare a strong bench or a secured chair. Sit on the bench or chair and place your hands shoulder-width apart along the edge.Slowly slide your butt off the seat with your legs extended in front of you. Straighten your arms to keep tension on the triceps. \n Bend your elbows carefully while keeping your back close to the bench. Upon completing this part, press down on the bench to straighten your arms. \n For a basic ab crunch, lie on your back on a mat or a carpeted surface. Bend your knees and make sure that your feet are flat on the floor.You can cross your arms in front of your chest or place your hands behind your neck or head. Try to pull your shoulders towards the ceiling by making use of the force from your abdominal muscles. \n Hold the “crunched” position for a few seconds, then lie back down and repeat. \n Make use of resistance tools such as resistance bands or weight machines to help you with your form. You should only move on to these exercises once you can successfully perform the body-weight exercises indicated above. It’s also a good idea to research specific resistance exercises that target the affected area.Bench presses can be done with resistance bands. Lay down on a bench and push forward while gripping the bands like you are lifting barbells. \n Start with lighter-weight bands. If you feel comfortable with the current weight, fold it lengthwise to increase the resistance. Once you feel comfortable, you can move on to heavier-weight bands. \n In addition to the other exercises described in this article, cardio exercise is a good way to build up atrophied muscles. Try establishing a regular walking or cardio routine.Start with ten to fifteen minutes of continuous walking per day. Gradually increase your speed and try to take a 30-minute walk or jog daily. \n After each workout, stretch your muscles to increase their range of motion. Do five to ten minutes of stretching after each workout. You can also perform a separate stretching session.Make sure to perform stretches that target all of the major muscles, and hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds. \n Begin with stretching your back and your upper body. Next move on to stretches for your neck, forearms, wrists and triceps. Do not forget your chest, buttocks and groin area before moving to your thighs. Lastly, perform stretches for instep and hamstrings. \n Here are some specific stretching exercises for different parts of the body:Neck stretching: Incline your head forward then stretch your neck to the left, right, back and forward. Do not roll your head from side to side as this practice is dangerous. \n Shoulder stretching: Place your left arm on your chest. Grab the forearm with the opposite arm. Pull it until you feel that your shoulder is being stretched. Push the arm you are stretching in the opposite direction to contract the muscles. Do the same steps for the right arm. \n Triceps stretching: Start with raising your right arm. Bend the right elbow and reach down behind your head and between the shoulder blades. Make use of the left arm to reach and grab the right elbow. Lastly, pull your elbow toward your head. \n Wrist stretching: Simply hold your arm out and slightly pull back your hand with the opposite hand. Do this repetitively. \n Hamstrings stretching: Start in a cross-legged sitting position. Put one leg out. Attempt to reach and hold the foot for a few seconds. Go back to the starting position and do the same thing with the other leg. \n Lower back stretch: Lie down on your back. Bring one leg up to chest level. Do the same with the other leg. \n Leg stretching: Lie down on your back and extend both legs in the air. Grab the back of your thighs and pull the legs toward your face. \n A constant supply of protein is necessary for muscle growth. See the basic guidelines below for daily recommended protein intake based on your age and gender.Adult men should eat about 56 grams of protein per day. \n Adult women should eat about 46 grams per day. \n Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should eat at least 71 grams of protein per day. \n Teenaged boys should eat about 52 grams a day. \n Teenaged girls should eat about 46 grams per day. \n Foods rich in protein include turkey breast, fish, cheese, pork loin, tofu, lean beef, beans, eggs, yogurt, dairy products, and nuts. \n A nutritionist, personal trainer, or dietician might suggest something other than the recommended dose based on your condition, weight, and activity level. \n If you don’t eat sufficient carbohydrates to fuel your body, it will start breaking down muscles instead. This can further aggravate the muscle atrophy in the affected area.To build atrophied muscle, your carbohydrate intake should be at least 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake.Try to select carbohydrates that are also full of fiber and do not have a lot of added sugars. These include fruits and vegetables, whole grains, plain yogurt, and milk. \n These good fats stop the breakdown of muscle by interfering with the inflammatory process.Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids include sardines, salmon, soybeans, flax seeds, walnuts, tofu, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, shrimp, and winter squash. \n The recommended dose for omega-3 fatty acids is 1 to 2 grams daily, When the body experiences stress, it prepares to respond. This preparation is known as the fight-or-flight response. In this response, many hormone levels shoot up including the stress hormone known as cortisol, which can break down muscle tissue during periods of prolonged stress.Since stress cannot be completely eliminated in our lives, take steps to minimize. Identifying the source of your stress can help you prevent it from occurring. You can also try stress-control techniques such as meditation or yoga. For specific suggestions, talk with a therapist, counselor, or mental-health professional about the stressors in your life. \n When we sleep, our body builds and repairs muscles, so this is an important step to combat muscle atrophy.Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep per day. \n 
 It is also important to expand your vocabulary. Do this by keeping a dictionary close by when reading in-case you run into any words you are not familiar with. When ever you have the time, look up synonyms for different words and practice grammar, sentence structure, and other forms of writing skills such as nominalization, descriptive paragraphs, etc. This will help broaden your knowledge of English and you will find your writing more fluent.\n If the plot is unclear you may find clashing ideas later on in the story so be sure to have a good idea of it before you begin. Be sure to stay away from common ideas and try to create your own unique story line. For example, the story line of the rogue sorceress conquering the world is incredibly clichéd and over used. Think up your own unique story. \n If you are finding this is a problem you could always try basing your characters on someone you know in real life; give them a similar personality, similar physical traits, or a similar name. By doing this you will be able to form a clear image of the character in you head. Be sure to ask permission if you plan on basing your character completely on someone you know. Obviously you can write a decent novel about events that actual occurred, such as the novel, A Captain's Story by Richard Phillips or Touching the Void by Joe Simpson. If your decent novel is about something that really happened, you don't have to create characters. \n Choose where your characters will live; what town, what country, maybe even what world? If you are thinking of writing a fantasy novel it may be difficult to come up with a scene. Open your mind and consider every possibility. It is a good idea to carry a notebook and pen with you wherever you go, as you may see something that inspires a great scene for your novel. If your story is not fantasy / sci-fi, consider using real town names and cities (but be sure to do your research on the town first). \n Another good way to clear your mind is by exercising. Activities such as walking, going to the beach, yoga and meditation can really open up your mind, so give them a go. If none of these methods work for you, there are other ways to open your mind. Try the brainstorming method, write down all the words that come to mind until you feel like your mind has 'expanded'. \n Now would be the time to search for inspiration. Inspiration can be found in the smallest things; music, art work, poems, even the night sky. Watch the world around you, there are many potential stories just waiting to happen. To make sure no potential story goes to waste, always carry a small notebook and pen in your bag and write down ideas that arise. Also, consider your dreams as a potential novel. Yes, dreams may be abstract, but they are also stories just waiting to happen! \n Pretend you are there, inside your story, living the life of your characters. This will give you a sense of how real your story feels. By doing this you can also get a feel of the emotions your characters should be portraying in your novel. Put yourself in the shoes of the character to create real emotions and reactions. \n Reading books daily can expand your mind and English capabilities. Readers gain many benefits from reading, as well as new ideological beliefs and an open mind. If you prefer to stick to mainly one particular genre, try to expand your horizons and read many genres. For example, if you only read fantasy novels, try to begin reading a mystery novel. It is always good to approach life with a ready mind that is open to new ideas. \n If a child is telling you an anecdote be sure to listen carefully, or if you come across children playing a game observe for a little while, (of course you won't want to come off as 'creepy', remember this is all in good nature). If you have children of your own or if you have younger siblings you can look towards them for inspiration. True, at first some anecdotes told by children can seem far fetched, but when done correctly these anecdotes or 'child games' can turn into a brilliant idea for a story. \n You can use their sentences or paragraphs as an outline to help you get started. \n If this is the case, don't be disheartened, but persevere. Writing should be an enjoyable experience and you will know you have done a good job once you are feeling content towards your novel. \n 
 \n A stepping must be preformed smoothly and with agility to be affective. \n Focus must be on leaping the balance of the body. \n The movement must be carried out with revolution and self-confidence.\n \n Footwork that makes the opponent loses sense and distance. \n Drawing that falsely cause the opponent to think there is something wrong. \n Target open for attack easily. \n To avoid being attacked. \n To launch an accurate and timely attack. \n The target, the ball of your front foot, and the heel of your back foot should be on the same line so that the back foot is slightly to the side of the front foot. In Tae Kwon Do, we do this so that we can execute techniques such as front snap kick or roundhouse without having to adjust the foot position first. \n Don't try to stand all the way up on your toes, but this way you can move quickly and pivot without having to adjust your weight. \n Just avoid keeping your knees locked and standing stiffly. Keep the center of your belt just over the middle of both feet so that you know you are standing with the center of your mass in the middle. \n Hands up, shoulders down. \n A good fighting stance allows you to be ready with out wearing you out. Being stiff makes you rigid and also will make you tired before even starting. \n
 at school) where speaking is expected. \n Ability to talk and normally interact in other circumstances. \n The inability to speak under certain situation is having a negative impact on social and academic functions. \n The symptoms last for longer than one month, excluding the first month of school (it takes time to adjust to a new environment). \n The symptoms cannot be accounted for by unfamiliarity with the spoken language under the given social situation (i.e. a girl fluent in another language who knows very little English and remains quiet in situations where English is spoken does not have selective mutism!) \n The symptoms cannot be accounted for by another disability, such as autism/Asperger syndrome, schizophrenia, or general psychotic disorders. \n The inability to speak is not by choice, but rather by extreme anxiety preventing the individual from speaking.\n To overcome selective mutism, you must first recognise how it is affecting you. Find out the specific circumstances in which you are unable to speak. For example, a child may speak normally with peers, but unable to talk to adults. Another child may talk and behave totally normal at home, but remains completely silent at school. By identifying the particular situation where selective mutism manifests, you can help direct your efforts to overcome selective mutism under these circumstances. \n Then gradually introduce another person to interact with to join the conversation. Start with the most comfortable person you can talk with and progress gradually to the most uncomfortable person for you to talk to. The idea of this technique is that the anxiety caused by the persons you feel uncomfortable interacting with will "fade" away when this stimulus is associated with another person you feel very comfortable interacting with. \n via letter, e-mail, instant message, online chat, etc. \n Then progress to more interactions, such as by phone, then interact at a distance, and eventually to more direct interactions. This method is also highly effective for numerous other anxiety disorders, such as specific phobias. The idea of this method is to overcome the anxiety causing inability to speak by gradual exposure to increasing levels of the anxiety-provoking stimulus, eventually becoming desensitized enough to overcome the actual situation. \n Gradually increase the comfort level. Due to the extreme anxiety, it is crucial to get as much help and encouragement from others as possible.Try audio recordings of one's own voice, then replaying the speech to develop comfort with speaking -- this technique is known as Shaping. Practice whispering at a public place as in an office or classroom with a friend/parent or teacher, and practice gradually increasing the volume to a talking level. \n Instead of thinking "I can't talk..." think "I can try to talk and make it possible if I work at it! " \n One may benefit from public speaking classes for learning to do presentations, and even for small venues such as job interviews. Entertainers and other public speakers get used to having that stress when speaking or singing for a large audience. Sometimes, however, even well-experienced entertainers turn to drugs to attempt to control these stressful feelings, to relax on stage. Later in one's career while being naturally relaxed, one may desire to feel the old excitement, when it is rarely felt at all. Often, at the head table or on stage one may look at each other to offer support and to get a smile or a nod of appreciation. \n There is considerable stress related to new social situations as well as in the larger venues with crowds. \n In that case, you should seek professional help and may require the use of medications to cope with selective mutism. Common medications prescribed to help reduce anxiety to allow speaking and interaction include fluoxetine (Prozac) and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Use of medications should be combined with repeated practice of the above techniques and anxiety-reduction techniques for the greatest likelihood of overcoming selective mutism. \n 
  This includes the airline, your flight's gate, the departure time, estimated arrival time (sometimes you won't hear this until you get on the flight) and your seat number.  Write this down on a card and stick it in a zipper pocket of a jacket or purse.  It's also a good idea to make a note of it on your phone, or write it on a slip of paper and place it inside your phone case.\n  Since you're traveling alone, you don't want to be weighed down with 50+ pounds of luggage.  Pack a small suitcase or medium-sized bag with: \n entertainment for the flight, such as books, colored pencils, a sketchpad or journal, headphones, etc. \n any medication you might need, such as ibuprofen for headaches or a stomachache relief tablet \n clothes and other important things (contacts, spare glasses, hearing aids, toothbrush) in case your luggage gets lost, delayed, or stolen \n snacks (even if there will be a meal served) \n gum, lollipops and hard candy or mints to suck on and relieve pressure and ear popping \n If you are blind, deaf, mute, in a wheelchair, etc., make sure a flight attendant on the plane is able to help you in case you need anything or would be able to assist you in the case of an evacuation. \n If you are blind or physically limited in any way, make sure you can get to the lavatory easily.  If you can't, alert a flight attendant.  Some planes have flight-attendant alert cords to pull if you can't reach the alert button. \n  Be sure you can receive a call, place a call, or turn the phone on and off.  This is important for communicating with your parents and the person picking you up at the end of the flight. \n  Your bag may be the same as someone else's, but you will be able to tell yours from theirs if yours has a colorful ribbon tied around the handle, or a strip of polka-dot duct tape across the front. \n  Put your name on the tag of your sweater and inside your shoes.  This may prevent you from losing them and from people walking off with them. \n  Keep your ticket, cell phone, your passport, and any cash you're bringing in the purse.  Don't let it leave your side until you reach your destination. \n  Don't wear anything that will be removed for security but takes a long time to be put back on. \n Girls, do not wear anything form-fitting.  You will be alone, and the airport is a very dangerous place for young girls.  Wear clothing that fits properly but does not show off any part of your body. \n  Be sure that your suitcase(s) is/are fixed with labels and left with airport employees. \n  If you were dropped off at the airport and are fending for yourself, make it look like you know where you are going and are determined to get there, even if you're not quite sure where to go.  Make a point of asking for help if you get lost. \n When you reach security, remove your shoes and sweater before you get to the line.  If possible, load all of your belongings into a bin and carry the bin to the line, to help you move through faster. \n When you leave security, ensure that you have everything. \n  If you realize you forgot something, like gum, you can buy it at one of the convenience stores.  This might be a good time to buy breakfast or lunch if you haven't already and it isn't being served on the flight, or go to the bathroom. \n  Bring them into the bathroom stall with you and keep them right beside you in line for coffee or a magazine. \n  Pay attention to what the flight attendant is saying.  You don't want to miss your category. \n If someone on the flight is making you uncomfortable, don't hesitate to call a flight attendant.  You are, after all, an unaccompanied minor. \n  In case of an emergency, you need to know what to do. \n  Get a drink and a snack when the cart comes around.  If a meal is being served, eat it.  You don't want to be hungry or thirsty. That being said, listen to your body. If the food is gross and you get nauseous easily, pass on the meal and go for some pretzels and ginger ale instead. \n  Breathe deeply and try to sleep.  Distract yourself with books and other things to do.  Eat some pretzels.  Drink some soda. \n  Dispose of any garbage.  Make sure nothing is left behind.  Tie your shoes and put on your sweater even if you're feeling warm: you don't want to lose it. \n  If items up above shifted during the flight, you'll be safe from falling objects. \n  Inform them that you are off the plane and you will be at the baggage carousel. \n  Before taking up a spot beside a carousel, make sure it has the luggage from your flight, otherwise you'll be standing there for a long time. \n When you have your luggage, call the person meeting you again and ask them where they want to meet up with you.  Make your way there, or stay at the baggage claim and wait for them if they tell you to do so. \n Don't leave with anyone that you don't recognize. \n While you are walking to meet them or waiting, call your parents and inform them that you landed safely and have all your luggage, and that you love them.  Parents really appreciate that last bit. \n 
 The purpose of pre-natal care is to identify risk factors and potential complications that the mother may experience during pregnancy. For this reason, it's essential that you make regular pre-natal appointments and attend all of them. \n Your initial visit will include a comprehensive assessment of your health history, medical history, nutritional history, and more. Successive visits will also include a physical exam, laboratory tests, and an ultrasound exam. \n During your prenatal check-up, you should ask questions regarding any concerns you might have about possible complications, immunizations, and other ways to maintain a healthy pregnancy.\n During your prenatal checks, your health care provider may order a series of tests to find out your health status. \n Pelvic examinations and cervical or vaginal smears may also be ordered to determine the presence of any issues or infections. \n Do not hesitate to ask your health care provider for more details about any tests. Your health care provider is responsible for explaining the procedure and the purpose of the test, and to let you know about the results of the test. \n Many of the causes of bleeding and other maternal complications are because of an unhealthy lifestyle. Therefore, the obvious solution is to modify your lifestyle according to your pregnancy needs. For some, lifestyle changes are not quite easy, but just think about how both you and your baby will benefit. \n Pregnancy is not an excuse for physical inactivity (unless contraindicated by your health care provider due to health reasons). A pregnant woman may still exercise during pregnancy but with lower intensity and duration. \n Exercise improves blood circulation, contributes to stress reduction, enhances self-esteem, and improves the over-all health of a pregnant woman. The exercises you may consider include swimming, walking, or stretching. These exercises are known to be non-weight bearing activities. They are less strenuous and very convenient for pregnant women to engage in. \n Exercise at least three times in a week for 30 minutes, then rest for 10 minutes after exercise by lying on your side. This removes pressure on a major vein in your abdomen that carries blood supply to your heart. \n Towards the end of your pregnancy, you may experience increased respiratory effort and decreased cardiac reserve. This can lead to physiologic stress. To avoid this, you should not engage in strenuous exercise during the advanced stages of pregnancy. \n Stop exercising immediately if you feel any shortness of breath, dizziness, numbness, tingling, pain of any kind, more than four uterine contractions per hour, decreased fetal activity, or vaginal bleeding. Consult your health care provider immediately. \n Nutrition is a major factor that can contribute to a successful pregnancy. Ask your health care provider or a nutritionist to come up with a diet plan that provides you with the right balance of nutrients, vitamins and minerals that you need for your pregnancy. \n You may also check the recommended daily dietary allowances or the recommended daily intakes of selected nutrients during pregnancy on the internet or in books on pregnancy. \n Reading such informative materials will help you to understand the role of nutrition during pregnancy and the recommended food sources. \n Pregnancy itself can be very stressful, as you are going through a lot of physical changes and discomforts. Unfortunately, stress is bad for the baby and can contribute to bleeding and other issues. \n Therefore, it's important to minimize outside sources of stress and to try to stay as calm as possible. \n Resting and relaxing are encouraged during pregnancy. One technique that can be very effective in getting yourself to relax is conscious relaxation. \n Conscious relaxation is the process of releasing tension from the mind and body though deliberate effort and practice. \n Preparation: Loosen clothing; assume a comfortable sitting or side-lying position with all parts of the body well-supported by pillows. The use of soothing music is optional. \n Beginning: Allow yourself to feel warm and comfortable. Inhale and exhale slowly, and imagine a sense of peaceful relaxation coming over each part of your body, starting with the neck and working your way down to the toes. \n Maintenance: Use imagery to maintain the state of relaxation. \n Awakening: Return to the wakeful state gradually \n Practice conscious relaxation for 10-15 minutes each day and you will feel refreshed and invigorated. \n Drinking alcohol is associated with high rates of miscarriage. Cigarette smoking is also associated with increased frequency of abruption placenta, placenta previa, premature rupture of membranes, and preterm labor. , For obvious reasons, these elements are harmful for the fetus and for the mother as well. These substances have the potential to cross the placental barrier which protect the baby. \n Check with your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medications. Some medications contain ingredients that could be harmful to your pregnancy. Also remember to read the labels for the ingredients and proper use of certain medications and products. \n If you are working in a hazardous environmental workplace (e.g. Radiologic department, laboratories and factories especially dealing with different kinds of chemicals), consider changing of job assignment or workplace. \n Sex is usually safe as long as it feels comfortable. However, there are certain conditions under which it is not safe to have sexual intercourse. \n Abstain from sex if you if you have history of premature dilation of the cervix and abnormal vaginal bleeding. \n Report to your health care provider if you are experiencing vaginal bleeding and/or uterine cramping during intercourse. \n Physical abuse is harmful for both mother and baby. Maternal battering increases the risk of maternal complication, bleeding, infections, and other harmful condition. \n Therefore, it is highly important that you report any form of physical abuse to your health care provider or to recognized authorities. \n This is never an easy step, especially for women who value their relationships with their partners. \n Bleeding means different things throughout pregnancy. If you are bleeding heavily and have severe abdominal pain and menstrual-like cramps or feel like you are going to faint during first trimester, it could be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants somewhere other than the uterus, and can be life-threatening. Heavy bleeding with cramping could also be a sign of miscarriage in first or early second trimester. These are the terms used to describe the approximate amount of vaginal bleeding: \n Heavy vaginal bleeding: greater than the heaviest normal menstrual flow. \n Moderate vaginal bleeding: equal to heaviest menstrual flow. \n Light vaginal bleeding: less than the heaviest menstrual flow. \n It's very common for women to have some nausea when pregnant. However, if this nausea becomes severe, it may be a sign of something more serious. \n If you can’t eat or drink anything, you run the risk of becoming dehydrated. Being malnourished and dehydrated can harm the baby. \n If the you experiences severe nausea, it's important to tell your health care provider. The doctor may prescribe medication or advise you to change your diet. \n A doctor will usually ask you to lie your side to see if this gets the baby moving. Counting kicks can also help. \n As a general rule, you should feel 10 or more kicks in two hours. Anything less should prompt a phone call to your doctor. \n The doctor has monitoring equipment that can be used to determine if the baby is moving and growing appropriately. \n Symptoms such as a persistent, severe headache, abdominal pain, visual disturbances, and swelling during your third trimester could be a sign of preeclampsia. \n Preeclampsia is a serious condition that develops during pregnancy and is potentially fatal. The disorder is marked by high blood pressure and excess protein in the the urine, typically occurring after the 20th week of pregnancy. \n If you suspect preeclampsia, you should call your doctor right away and get your blood pressure tested. Good prenatal care can help catch preeclampsia early. \n If you see any tissue protruding from your vagina, do not pull it out; you must go immediately to a physician to get it checked out. You might be experiencing a miscarriage. \n Though traumatizing, a miscarriage is often followed by a healthy pregnancy; there are very rare cases in which a women has repeated miscarriages. \n Try to wear a sanitary pad in order to see approximately how much bleeding there is. It is extremely important to pay attention and look for clots in the blood (clots could be an indication of internal hemorrhage or another clotting disorder) and to take note of the color of the blood (you need to see if it is a lighter red or a darker one. \n If you have vaginal bleeding, it is best to lay down for two reasons: first of all, to avoid dizziness and second of all, if you lay down, you minimize the rapidness of the blood loss. Most of the time, the treatment for bleeding is rest. The doctor or midwife may also advise a pregnant woman to take time off work and stay off her feet. \n If you are bleeding (even minimally) do not have sexual intercourse for at least a few days after the bleeding has stopped, unless you are told otherwise by your gynecologist. This measure is meant to protect you against physical trauma that could lead to another bleed. \n Do not use tampons. Do not use tampons to control the bleeding, use pads instead. This is important as tampons can irritate the vaginal orifice or the cervix, possibly leading to further bleeding. \n Do not engage in any physical activity after you have experienced a bleed, as this could lead to greater blood loss. Remember that you are supposed to get as much rest as possible following a bleed during pregnancy. \n Clearing your vagina this way could affect the equilibrium of the bacterial flora present in the vagina. By altering this equilibrium, you could make the vagina more susceptible to other infections which could affect your pregnancy. \n You might experience some spotting in the early stages of pregnancy, but this occurs in many women. This spotting is due to implantation and it usually occurs within 12 days from the fertilization. \n Implantation means that the fertilized egg it has attached itself and penetrated into the uterine mucosa, preparing for further development. \n Besides implantation bleeding (in many cases harmless), there might be some other diseases that can generate vaginal bleeding during this stage of pregnancy. Therefore, it's important to make your doctor aware of any bleeding and to undergo testing if necessary. \n Bleeding during pregnancy can be a sign of miscarriage. However, it is very important to know that not all women who have vaginal bleeding are suffering a miscarriage, so if you are experiencing this type of bleeding do not panic - just call your doctor. \n It's important to be aware that a miscarriage also has other symptoms such as abdominal cramps (these can be very severe, having more intensity than normal abdominal cramps that many pregnant women experience sometimes) and you might see foreign tissue passing through your vagina. \n If this is the case, you should immediately go to the hospital. \n Another medical condition that might lead to vaginal bleeding (also associated with internal hemorrhage) is ectopic pregnancy. This means that implantation has not occurred in the normal place (the uterine cavity) but in the fallopian tubes. \n After the implantation, the embryo grows and develops until the fallopian tube cannot support anymore. The ectopic tissue then ruptures, leading to a potentially lethal hemorrhage. This condition is much rarer than miscarriage. \n The main symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include severe pain in the lower abdomen (caused by the rupture of the fallopian tubes), low blood pressure (caused by the loss of blood through the fallopian tube rupture ), tachycardia (also caused by the loss of blood, as the heart needs to pump faster because it has a smaller quantity of blood to work with). \n Another potential cause of vaginal bleeding is molar pregnancy – this is when abnormal tissue grows inside the uterine cavity instead of a fetus. This occurs as a result of a genetic abnormality. \n Other signs of this condition (besides bleeding) would be a rapidly growing uterus (because the abnormal tissue grows much faster than a normal baby) or excessive nausea and vomiting. \n Another possible symptom is the presence of a foreign tissue protruding through the vagina, which looks like a bunch of grapes. \n Any vaginal infection due to unprotected sex can lead to vaginal bleeding during the first trimester. One of the most common vaginal infections is gonorrhea. \n Vaginal infections can cause bleeding as they lead to inflammation and blood vessel dilation, which makes the blood vessels more susceptible to rupture. \n Because the fetus is more developed in this stage, any vaginal bleeding could mean that he or the mother are in danger. There are some medical conditions that are associated with bleeding during this late stage of development, one of them being placenta previa. \n This medical condition does not occur very often but it can generate a troublesome pregnancy. In placenta previa, the placenta (the anatomical structure that connects the fetus to the mother) is abnormally located, lower than usual, blocking the uterine cervix. \n A bleeding placenta previa does not cause pain, thus making it harder to diagnose on time; so if you have vaginal bleeding — even if it is not associated with pain — you should get it checked out. \n Placental abruption is a very serious condition that endangers both the mother and the baby. \n This rare medical condition is caused by the disruption of the placenta from the uterine wall, causing hemorrhage due to the blood vessels rupturing. \n Other signs of placental abruption include lower abdomen and back pain,and blood clots through the vagina. \n Another cause of vaginal bleeding is preterm labor. This occurs before the 37th week of pregnancy and requires immediate medical assistance. \n You might experience some mucous-like vaginal discharge, sometimes associated with blood. This occurs when the mucous plug that normally covers the uterine cervix opening is expulsed. \n Contractions are also present, as is lower abdominal and back pain. \n 
 For example, if you have chosen a Rubber Ducky theme, you will need to collect rubber ducky designs for your umbrellas.\n The ribbon that you use to decorate the umbrellas should match or complement your shower colors. Two colors should be sufficient. \n A white umbrella works well, but you may also choose a pastel color as long as the color complements the shower theme and the decorations. Choose the appropriate size of umbrella for your presentation and whether you have a particular preference for the type of handle it has. \n The picture should be wide enough to cover 2/3 of the umbrella panel’s edge and tall enough to cover 1/3 of the umbrella panel’s height. An image that is too small will not be visible from a distance. \n You will need one image for half of the total number of panels. If your umbrella has 8 panels, then you will need 4 images. \n Keep the steam function turned off. \n You can keep the umbrella closed. Simply flatten the panel over the board as much as you would flatten a section of a shirt before ironing it. \n \n The applique should be placed with the image against the fabric and the transfer paper facing upward. \n Place the bottom of the applique 1/4” from the bottom edge of the umbrella panel. \n Center the applique between the 2 sides of the panel. \n This will ensure that the image doesn’t bleed onto the ironing board cover. \n Iron slowly without scorching the transfer paper. \n The edges of the ribbon should hang down, with one side of the ribbon crossing the other side at a 45-degree angle. \n The glue should go where the ribbons intersect at the bottom of the loop. \n \n Flatten the ribbon onto a table or work surface. \n Create 2 loops in the center of the ribbon. Pinch the bottom of one loop with your right hand and the bottom of the other loop with your left hand. \n Pull the left loop behind and around the base of the right loop. \n Push the top end of the left loop through the loop that you just created. \n Pull tightly, allowing the ends to dangle down. Make sure that each loop is evenly sized. The loops should look like mirror images of one another. \n The glue should go at the ribbon’s intersection but on the surface of the top ribbon rather than in between. \n You can either cut the ends at an angle or use pinking shears. Make sure to use sharp scissors so that you don’t fray the edges of the ribbon. \n Now, your umbrella panels should have one applique panel, followed by a ribbon panel. The alternating pattern should continue around the umbrella. \n You can choose miniature pacifiers, baby shoes or whatever matches the theme of your shower. \n \n The ribbon should match your applique and double-layer ribbon. \n The ribbon should be wide enough to cover the supports and the edge easily but not so wide that it obscures your applique design. The applique and the edging ribbon should gently overlap at the bottom of the image. \n Start at the top of the umbrella and pipe the glue downward along one of the supports. \n You can start at any point along the edge. \n Allow the final end of the ribbon to overlap the front end by about 2”. \n Pinch the ribbon with your non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to pull the ribbon between your thumb and index finger. The amount of ribbon that hangs below your thumb will be the dangling end of the bow. \n This first loop will determine the diameter of your ribbon and should be at least 6” from left to right. Pinch the end of the large loop between the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand with the other length of ribbon. \n Again, pinch the end of the loop between the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand. \n Ideally, you should make at least 5 loops that gradually decrease in size. \n You should have loops in both the foreground and the background of your ribbon for a layered look., You can use either florist’s wire or hot glue, depending on the way that the top of the umbrella is constructed. Use florist’s wire if the umbrella has a protruding piece on top, and use hot glue if the top is flat.
 Buy untreated barley that has come straight from the farm. You can usually use barley that is used to feed livestock. \n You may have to purchase a 50 lb. bag, but you will want to start with 10 lbs. or less while you become accustomed to the malting process., High-protein varieties can result in cloudy beer., Make sure there are few broken grains and no mold or bugs., You will want several so that you can soak and drain the barley during this part of the process., of barley. You need enough space and water for all of the grains to float. When in doubt, use less barley instead of more, since the barley expands as it absorbs moisture., If you have a lot of mineralization, use a water purifier on your faucet while you cover it with water. Fill the bucket to the top until it overflows a few inches. \n Letting some of the water flow over will get rid of dirt and debris in the water., The grains will be floating during these two hours. If they aren’t you may be using a bucket that is too small., Pour the grains into a thin layer on trays and dry them for eight hours., Pour the barley back inside. Cover it in warm water and steep it for two more hours., After 24 hours of this process you should start to see the chits, or roots, growing from the base of the barley kernels. Move onto the next part of the process when it looks like 95 percent of the grains have sprouted., A clean concrete floor or counter is ideal. The room must also be well ventilated and stay at 64 degrees Fahrenheit (18 Celsius)., Turn them every two hours to avoid bacteria and mold from forming., Keep this process going for two to five days., This is the white leaf that grows inside as it germinates. When the leaf is 80 to 100 percent of the size of the grain, it is time to move on to the next step. \n Split a kernel to test the germination every day for five days. \n You will want a steady temperature between 90 and 125 degrees Fahrenheit (31 to 50 Celsius) for up to two days. You can use a dehydrator on a low setting, an oven with the oven light on or a protected, sunny place outside. \n Test the temperature of the area you are considering ahead of time to ensure the temperature is right for drying the malt. \n Leave it outside for about two days. Turn the malt every half an hour., The easiest way to tell is to weight it at this point. If it weighs 10 percent more than it did at the beginning, it is ready., You want to separate the barley from the rootlets. Discard the rootlets., Crush it for use in beer., You can toast for 350 °F (177 °C) for an hour to get brown malt.
 A sprain will involve ligament and tissue damage, so your child should feel pain. Heat in the injured area occurs because your child’s body will try to prevent infection by increasing the temperature of the injured area. Bacteria is less likely to thrive in higher temperatures. \n If your child indicates to you they are experiencing sharp, aching or excruciating pain, take them to the nearest hospital or clinic. This might be a sign that the tissues or structures around the ligament are also damaged.Surgery may be required to fix this level of injury.\n The sprain causes damage to the ligament and other adjacent structures, which leads to internal bleeding and a rush of blood to the injured area, resulting in swelling. \n If your child has a sprain, there will be bruising or redness in the injured area for the next 12 to 24 hours and into the first week of having the injury. Bruising is a sign of internal bleeding. \n Due to swelling and pain, your child may have a limited range of motion in the injured area. \n If your child cannot move the sprained joint at all, this may be a sign of severe nerve and tissue damage, and will require immediate medical attention. Bring your child to the nearest hospital or clinic., This can indicate the injured area is not getting enough blood and oxygen, and will require immediate medical attention., Make sure your child is not displaying any symptoms of a serious sprain that needs to be treated by a doctor at the hospital, such as intense pain. \n If your child can tolerate the pain and the injured area is warm, reddish or pinkish in appearance, this means the injured site still has good blood flow and can be treated at home.If the sprained area does not improve within the first 48-72 hours, you need to take your child to the nearest hospital or doctor. Diagnostics and physical exams may reveal other, more serious joint problems. \n Massaging the area will promote increased blood flow to the site and worsen your child’s pain. It can also result in increased swelling in the area. \n To treat a sprained ankle, start wrapping at the base of your child’s toe. This will help fluids from their toes to move back to their heart and reduce the amount of swelling in the area. \n Get a good base wrap at the toe so that the elastic bandage will not unravel. \n After you covered the front and back parts of their foot, continue the wrap at top of their ankle and do a figure 8 wrap. Their heel and toes should be exposed. \n Secure the wrap with a metal clasp. \n Check your child’s toes for circulation. Re-wrap the area if their toes look blue or if they complain the wrap feels too tight. \n Compression will help to reduce swelling in the area. However, you need to make sure you wrap the elastic bandage so it is not too tight, as this will impede proper blood circulation. \n To treat a sprained wrist, wrap an Ace bandage around your child’s forearm. \n Take the tip of the Ace bandage and start wrapping from the base of their fingers all the way up to their forearm, stopping near the elbow. \n Overlap the elastic bandage about one-half of the width of the first applied wrap. \n Check the circulation of the wrapped area. If your child’s fingers look blue or they complain about numbness or tightness, restart the process until the wrap feels snug rather than too tight. \n Look for rigid materials like cardboard to make a splint and elastic material like a sock to wrap around the injured area. \n To splint an ankle sprain, get three pieces of cardboard of equal size. Put one piece under your child’s foot, and one piece on either sides of your child’s ankle. Wrap the splint with the sock to secure it. \n To splint a knee sprain, place a piece of cardboard on the back of your child’s knee. Make sure it is long enough so that your child’s leg cannot flex. Wrap the sock around the splint. \n To splint a wrist sprain, place a piece of cardboard under their wrist. Make sure it is long enough so that their wrist does not flex. Using the sock, wrap starting from the palmar crease (single line across the palm) going up to your child’s forearm.To splint a shoulder sprain, get a big handkerchief and fold it triangularly to create a sling under the forearm of the injured shoulder. Tie both ends at the back of your child’s neck so that the movement of their shoulder is limited. \n Though a heat compress might feel relaxing for your child, it will just increase the swelling of the site and will only lead to more pain after the heat compress is removed. \n Avoid applying a cold compress to the sprained area right away, as this delay allows your child’s body to supply blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the injured area to facilitate healing. \n If ice is applied to the injury during the first 24 hours, healing will be delayed as ice will constrict their blood vessels and limit blood flow to the area.A cold compress minimizes swelling by reducing blood flow to the injured area and numbing their nerve endings, which will lessen your child’s pain., Ask your child if they cannot feel anything on the sprained area with the cold compress applied. If this happens, remove the cold compress and reapply it every 2 to 4 hours daily until the swelling subsides.To apply a cold compress, wrap ice or an ice pack in a clean cloth and place it on the sprained area.Do not apply ice directly onto the sprained area as this can cause cold burns or skin damage from the extremely cold temperature.Avoid applying the cold compress close to bedtime or when your child is asleep. If you do so, remember to remove the compress after 20 minutes. \n This will help blood to return to their heart and improve blood circulation in the injured area. Increased blood flow is important because oxygen and nutrients will help your child’s sprain to heal properly.Your child can also place pillows under the sprained area to raise it while they are sleeping, reading, or watching TV. \n Depending on where the sprain occurs, resting does not mean your child will not be able to do other things. They can still perform other activities, but only if they do not put unnecessary pressure on the injury or cause a lot of movement using the injured area. \n Your child should rest the sprained joint and not use it at all for the first 1 to 2 days. After this point, your child can use the sprained area, but not beyond when they feel pain in the sprained joint. \n A sprain may last for 2-4 weeks, depending on the extent of injury. Thankfully, children’s ligaments generally heal faster compared to that of adults. This is due to the rapid growth and development of children at this stage. \n These will be especially useful if they have a sprained ankle or toe. If they put weight on the crutches for support, rather than on the sprained area, this will help the area to heal properly. \n This is necessary to prevent stiffness in the area. \n While rest is important for faster recovery, gentle movement of the injured site can be done as early as the first day. Instruct your child to stop movement of the sprained area only if they experience any intolerable pain. \n One of the common over-the-counter pain relievers available at your local drugstore is Paracetamol or Acetaminophen. It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances that stimulate the pain receptors to send pain signals to the brain. \n The recommended dose of Paracetamol is based on your child’s weight. The dose should be 10 to 15 mg every kg of the child. So if your child’s weight is 30 kilograms, you need to multiply 30 by 10 or 15 mg. This means you will give your child 300 to 450 mg of Paracetamol. Give this dose every 4 to 6 hours. \n This calculation can be used for children ages 2 to 12 years old.Keep in mind that pain relievers only treat the pain associated with sprain, not sprain itself. If the sprain isn’t serious, it will resolve on its own, with time and proper rest. \n 
 Probate is a process whereby the property of the deceased is legally transferred to the deceased’s beneficiaries and heirs. During probate, the estate’s debts and taxes are paid, and debts owed to the estate are also collected.Probate can happen with or without a will. \n You must follow your state’s probate laws in order to effectively transfer title to property. For this reason, probate isn’t optional. To settle a decedent’s estate, you need to go through the legal process.\n Formal probate happens in court and can take many months. But states have devised alternate ways of administering an estate that allows you to avoid court altogether. These alternate ways of settling an estate are often available for smaller estates. To see if the decedent’s estate qualifies, you need to estimate the size of the estate. \n Go through the financial records, tax returns, and other papers of the decedent to try to figure out what the decedent owned or controlled. You will be looking for bank accounts, brokerage accounts or other investments, life insurance or annuity policies, retirement plans, deeds to real estate, automobile titles, and any other evidence of anything of value. \n Separate out common non-probate assets: life insurance, pensions, property held in joint tenancy, payable on death accounts, and most property held in a trust.Then roughly estimate the value of the probate assets. Use this estimate to decide whether you can use a simple administration or other non-probate method of administration. \n There are many types of non-probate administration, which vary by state. Some of the more common include:No administration. If the estate is small enough, most states allow the property to be distributed without going through probate. The size requirements vary. In Florida, you can avoid probate altogether if the assets are exempt from creditor claims or are sufficient to only cover funeral expenses.In California, you can avoid probate if the estate is valued at no more than $150,000 or property is valued at no more than $50,000. In this situation, property may be claimed by affidavit.“Simple” or “summary” probate. Most states also offer an informal probate procedure called “summary administration” or “simple” probate. To be eligible, the estate must be smaller than a certain amount. For example, in California an estate cannot be worth more than $150,000. In Florida, the maximum is $75,000., The executor (or personal representative) is responsible for collecting and safekeeping estate property, paying debts and taxes, and then distributing estate property to the beneficiaries and heirs.The executor often seeks the help of other professionals, such as lawyer and accountants, whose fees are paid from the estate. \n Though executors are often named in wills, sometimes no executor is named. In this situation, individuals will apply to become the executor. States have different rules regarding who may be appointed executor of an estate. However, most states require that the executor be legally capable of handling his or her own affairs and be at least the age of majority (typically 18). \n Additionally, some states may require that you be a citizen of the state. \n Most states also prohibit felons from acting as executors., If you are eligible, contact the probate court by phone or in person and request the form necessary for appointment as executor from the clerk of court.Forms are often posted online at the court’s website. \n Forms vary from state to state, so be sure that you are filling out your state’s form. \n Alternately, if the will appoints you as executor and you wish to decline the position, then you can renounce the position by filing a petition with the court. You should ask the court clerk for the form. \n Follow all instructions when completing the form, and use either a typewriter or a pen with blue and black ink. Avoid making these common mistakes: \n not correctly notating the full name of the deceased \n not notarizing the form \n incorrectly completing the information asked for \n Make the correct number of copies, including one for yourself. Take the application to the clerk’s office. No appointment should be necessary. \n You will probably have to pay a filing fee.Call ahead of time to ask the amount of the fee and acceptable methods of payment. \n You typically must inform the other beneficiaries that you are applying to be the executor.You can notify them by completing a “Notice of Application” form, which should be available from the court clerk. \n Some states require that the proposed executor post a surety bond. A surety bond is insurance against wrongdoing. Should the executor make a mistake, the insurer will compensate the beneficiaries. The bond can often be paid by estate assets.Sometimes, if the decedent stated in the will that the executor does not need a bond, then the bond can be waived. \n To obtain a surety bond, search online for a company that provides bonds in your area. You may also check with the court clerk. The clerk may have a list of reputable companies. \n The bond company will want to look at your credit history and possibly run a background check., The court will schedule a hearing to give interested parties a chance to object to the appointment. Usually, the hearing is a formality and no one objects to the executor’s appointment. \n If someone challenges your appointment, then the court will hold a hearing. At the hearing, each side will argue why they should be appointed executor. If you are being challenged, you should contact an attorney. \n In some states, the hearing can also be dispensed with if all interested parties (i.e., those who would inherit property) sign waivers.\n If you find that you no longer want to continue as the executor, then you should file a petition with the court, stating your reasons. If the court finds that you have “good cause,” then a successor executor will be named. Often, the successor executor is identified in the will. If not, the court will hold a hearing and consider other family members., If the decedent had a will, then try to find it. Search for wills in filing cabinets, desk drawers, and safety deposit boxes. Also ask the decedent’s lawyer, who may have kept the will. \n If you can’t find the will, you will have to proceed through probate using your state’s intestacy laws. Intestacy laws provide the default rules for how the estate should be distributed. Speak to an attorney about this. \n In some states, the person who has the will (the “custodian”) must take the will to the probate court or to the executor within 30 days (or less) of the decedent’s death. Failure to do this could result in the custodian being sued for damages., You will need a number of official death certificates to serve as evidence of the death. The mortuary that handles the decedent’s funeral arrangements usually arranges for some certified death certificates. You should ask for at least 10. \n For more information on how to get copies of death certificates, visit wikiHow’s How to Acquire a Death Certificate. \n It is extremely important to hire an attorney.Some states, like Florida, require an attorney to go through regular probate.In other states, you are strongly encouraged to have a lawyer, who can help you navigate the probate process and keep you from making mistakes. To find a probate attorney, contact your state’s bar association, which should run a referral service. When choosing an attorney, consider: \n Location. It is usually best to choose an attorney who practices in the state where the decedent lived. This person will have familiarity with the relevant estate laws and probate procedure. \n Expertise. Choose an attorney who specializes in probate work. Additionally, if the estate is particularly large, then choose an attorney who has experience in the particular type of estate that you will probate. For example, if you are dealing with complex trust instruments, then you may need to hire someone who is a trust expert. You can get referrals by contacting your state’s bar association, which runs a referral network. \n Personality. As the executor, you will be in frequent contact with the attorney. You should choose someone who you trust and like personally. \n Hiring an accountant to manage estate funds ensures that the funds are handled correctly, which simplifies your job. Though not absolutely required, an accountant can make paying debts easy. An accountant also calculates and files the estate’s tax bills, which are often complicated.Consider hiring a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). A CPA often has more experience or education than a regular accountant. \n You should compare rates for accountants.Get an estimate from an accountant and then compare it to the rates offered by other CPAs in the area. \n You might want to consider hiring a financial planner, who can help you deal with the decedent’s accounts. Also, a financial planner can tell you how to close down accounts, cash them out, transfer them, or how to reinvest them.Anyone can use the title “financial planner.”You therefore need to gather recommendations. If you hire an attorney first, then the attorney can probably find you a reputable financial planner. \n If there is a will, then you must prove that the will is valid. Usually, to prove the validity of a will, all you need is a statement to that effect from one or more of the witnesses who signed the will. Courts allow different kinds of statements:A “self-proving affidavit” that was signed by the witness in front of a notary when the will was signed. \n A sworn statement signed by the witness at the time probate is opened. \n A statement by the witness made in court. \n If the witnesses to the will are no longer living, or cannot be found, then other evidence may be needed to prove that the will is valid. Your attorney will help you identify what kinds of evidence the court will accept. For example, courts will scrutinize the signature on the will and accept testimony from people familiar with the decedent’s signature in order to try and validate a will., If estate property is in the hands of other people, then you need to collect it. You also have the duty as the executor to keep all property safe., As executor, you need to figure out the value of the probate assets. This could potentially require that you hire an appraiser. \n To find an appraiser, search online. Type your city or county and “appraiser” into a web browser. Alternately, you could search the Yellow Pages. \n This worksheet will list all of the decedent’s property and their corresponding values. An example of an inventory is available here. \n Also create an inventory of non-probate assets. You will want to know the value of the non-probate assets as well in case you are trying to divide up assets evenly between beneficiaries. \n The decedent’s will typically specifies what each beneficiary will receive: specific assets, money, or a percentage of the estate. Nevertheless, wills vary greatly in terms of how detailed they are in allocating property. \n This is often a source of conflict. As the executor, you must proceed with great care.Keep lines of communication open. Talk to all family members to find out who is interested in what property. A typical will does not name a beneficiary for each specific piece of personal property owned by the decedent. Accordingly, you will have to decide who gets what. \n If more than one person is interested in the same piece of property, and that piece of property is not given to anyone in the will, then you can hold a “family auction.” At the auction, all assets are given a monetary value and the names of beneficiaries are pulled out of a hat. People then choose a piece of property. The value of each object they claim is then deducted from what they would receive from the estate. \n You should set up an estate checking account and pay all debts from this account. Open it in the name of the estate.Using one account will make it easier to track money coming in and going out. \n Get a taxpayer ID. To open a bank account, you will need an ID number. You can apply online at www.irs.gov. You also must complete IRS Form SS-4.You can also call the IRS and request a tax ID number. If you do this, then you will fill out Form SS-4 and mail it in afterwards. \n Make sure all debts owed to the estate are paid into the account as well. \n Be sure never to mix estate and personal funds. You should not dip into the estate account to cover personal expenses. Use it only for the estate’s expenses., Chances are that the decedent was carrying some sort of debt before he or she died. Common debts include mortgages, personal loans, and credit card debt. Creditors will make a claim on the estate for payment. In order to notify them, you should personally contact any bank or credit card company which you know made loans to the decedent. \n You must also publish notice so that any unknown creditors may come forward and make a claim on the estate. Your attorney should help you post this notice in appropriate newspapers.If a creditor does not step forward within the time specified by your state’s probate laws, then the estate cannot be charged for the debt. \n The deceased may also have lent money to other people or organizations. To help settle the estate, you will need to collect on those debts. \n You also need to inform those who owed the decedent money that they should make payment to the estate. Be sure to send debtors a letter to this effect, and keep copies on file.Also check with your attorney to find out how long debtors have to pay the debts they owe the estate. Be sure to include this information in the letter you send. \n Part of settling an estate is letting government agencies and private companies know that the deceased has passed. If the decedent was receiving Social Security payments, then you should contact SSA and let them know of the decedent’s passing. Also go through the decedent’s papers and see what other organizations you should contact: \n pension providers \n veteran’s benefits affairs \n life insurance companies \n You should contact any banks or brokers who the decedent had accounts with. You will need to close the accounts and transfer assets to the estate’s bank account. Unless the decedent owned these accounts jointly, any funds in them belong to the estate. \n You should also notify credit card companies that the decedent has passed. The credit card companies will then close the accounts. After the accounts have been closed, you should destroy the credit cards.The credit card companies will later make a claim on the estate. You should pay them off when you pay off all of the estate’s debts, before distribution of assets to beneficiaries. \n As the executor, you are responsible for paying taxes. The most common taxes will be income tax and estate tax.See IRS Publication 559, "Survivors, Executors, and Administrators" for details about how to file. \n Some states impose an inheritance or estate tax in addition to the federal estate tax and tax returns will be required if the decedent lived in, or owned any property in, any of those states. \n You need to pay estate debts out of the estate’s assets.If the debts were small, or there was a lot of cash in the estate, then paying the debts should be easy for your accountant. Sometimes, however, you need to liquidate assets to cover debts. \n The executor pays reasonable funeral expenses first.Your state statute will designate the order in which you pay debts and disburse estate assets. You must follow the order outlined in the statute. \n You may be presented with a claim against the estate that you do not think is legitimate. It is your responsibility as executor to make a decision whether to pay the claim or not. If you do not, then the creditor has a right to sue the estate. If you think some claims are not legitimate, then you should speak with your attorney about how to proceed. \n The decedent’s will typically specifies what each beneficiary will receive: specific assets, money, or a percentage of the estate. Nevertheless, wills vary greatly in terms of how detailed they are in allocating property. \n This is often a source of conflict. As the executor, you must proceed with great care.Keep lines of communication open. Talk to all family members to find out who is interested in what property. A typical will does not name a beneficiary for each specific piece of personal property owned by the decedent. Accordingly, you will have to decide who gets what. \n If more than one person is interested in the same piece of property, and that piece of property is not given to anyone in the will, then you can hold a “family auction.” At the auction, all assets are given a monetary value and the names of beneficiaries are pulled out of a hat. People then choose a piece of property. The value of each object they claim is then deducted from what they would receive from the estate. \n If property is not specifically given to a beneficiary, and no one wants the actual item, then you will need to liquidate the property and distribute the proceeds to the beneficiaries. \n If real estate remains, you need to speak to a realtor. A realtor can help you get a piece of property ready to sell. Be sure to communicate with beneficiaries what the sale price will be, and listen to any recommendations they make. \n Research where you can sell personal property. For personal assets (like furniture, books, mementos, etc.), decide where it is best to sell them. If there are antiques or art, then ask the appraiser. For more every-day objects, like cookware and clothes, you can probably hold a yard sale. Carefully keep track of the amount of money the sale brings in. \n Beneficiaries who were given specific pieces of property should be told when and how to collect it.If you need to deliver the property, then work with the beneficiary on how to deliver the property and how to pay for its delivery. \n After distributing specific property, you then distribute the remainder of the estate. Often, this will consist of distributing money once the estate has been liquidated. You should work with the beneficiaries to come to an agreement about when and how this money will be distributed. \n As the executor, you are probably entitled to be compensated for your services (though you can also decline). The amount of your compensation is set by state statute. In Oregon, for example, executors are entitled to: \n 7% of the first $1,000 of the estate \n an additional 4% of any amount over $1,000 but less than $10,000 \n an additional 3% of any amount above $10,000 up to $50,000 \n an additional 2% of any amount over $50,000. \n Also, the executor is entitled to 1% of non-probate property, such as life insurance proceeds., Once all assets are distributed and all bills are paid, the estate can be closed.Keep in mind that the estate is not closed until you receive the final order from the court. \n You will probably have to file a petition with the court, so it is important to involve the estate’s attorney in this process. \n Once you receive the final disposition of the estate, make sure to keep a copy, along with copies of any other relevant paperwork. Consult with your estate’s attorney and accountant as to what paperwork you need to keep from the estate and for how long you need to keep it. \n Be sure to close any bank account that you opened in the estate’s name. \n 
 Just because you're in the doghouse doesn't mean you can work through the problem without culture, manners and class. Every problem has a solution but fuming or hollering is not it...\n I was wrong! I made mistakes. Please forgive me." That can be a big start -- but it takes proving it, not just saying it! \n When things seem so huge, monumental -- don't look at that big picture. Take a snapshot to work on one or a few problem(s), and live one day, every day, one day at a time. \n If you don't know what you did or said, ask the people you know would tell you to your face and be prepared for them to be 110% honest. (You may or may not be a partier, who is life of the party and neglect your most important loved ones...) \n It should start off as private as possible. Say this and mean it: \n "That is not how I was raised. That is not me. How do I make things right?" \n \n You see, "Love others (your neighbor) as you love yourself", means to include everyone in doing right to all. \n Better to do this than to plant the seed for an ulcer months or years from now. The time for the "pity party" is right here. Just make sure you're the only one who gets the invitation and RSVP's. \n What could I have done differently?" Would it have been better all around if NOTHING had been said or NOTHING had been done? After that list is completed, study it and learn. \n Get puzzling it through done and over with (and out)! \n There is a movie of a father with four children who couldn't apologize -- but he could cook. What did he do after the funeral of his wife? \n He made what he told them was "apology stew" and served it to his kids. That name and food said a lot. They got well fed and received an apology unlike any other. \n \n When you hear of what you can do or say, then do your best to do it or say it. \n Learn from the expensive difficult lessons. \n What about chances that a "natural disaster" caused the damage? Just realize you have no control over that part of events. The list above are for when the problems are your fault -- and your fault alone. \n \n "Success and survival are making some progress each day -- step-by-step -- not reaching one big destination." \n 
 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need". You might want to hold off on the koi until the pond is ready though, especially if you're slow at digging and don't foresee completing this project in an afternoon!\n Choose a flat, available area of soil. \n Make any adjustments needed and fill in any extra space or make more room if the pool doesn’t fit. Make sure all the outside of the pool is closed in and no longer visible. \n Wait for about 5 hours to dry and set. \n If you do not have spring water, put tap, well, or city water into the pool about 80% and put several drops of dechlorinator and mix with pool net. \n Wait one hour for it to settle and spread. \n Wait about half an hour for the water to adjust with its new content. \n Sit back and enjoy! \n In the case of larger ponds an ozone generator system may also be required \n A cartridge or bio filter are a better idea for koi fish ponds \n While waterfalls do add oxygen to the water a high output ozone system can keep the water completely clear and clean. \n Having multiple suction ports for the pump in the water will prevent an entrapment hazard that could harm the koi fish. \n This is more of a cheaper filter then a quality filter but it still works well enough to keep the pond clean for a short time. The above suggestions would work best. \n Snails reproduce very quickly so keep an eye on the snail population to avoid being over run. \n While both will work for pond you should use the thicker acrylic pond if you can find one as the floors are many times thicker and less likely to develop damage or leaks \n

 You can do this by measuring the width of your bun and adding a couple of inches.\n They should be no thicker than your index finger and at least two inches longer than you need your stick to be \n Don't worry about getting a stick that is perfectly straight. Slight bends and curves in the wood make it more interesting to look at and they will hold your hair more securely. \n Avoid evergreen woods like pine as they can contain large amounts of sap. \n Hair is pretty strong, if a stick will snap when you bend it slightly, it will break in your hair. \n \n Ensure the end of the stick is sanded into a smooth curve. \n Do not use an ink pen as the ink may bleed into the wood. \n Put a small amount of your chosen oil on a plate and use your fingers to apply it to the wood. Make sure that all of the wood is covered with the oil. \n Walnut oil brings out darker colours in the wood, so a wood that looked rather boring before, can look stunning after it has been oiled. The darker the colour, the bigger difference the walnut oil will make. \n
 Discuss some of your other options that exist for the other nearby Walt Disney World parks or local attractions in the area. With other major possibilities being the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Disney's Animal Kingdom and the mess of water parks and other activities that Disney sponsors, decide if Disney's Hollywood Studios is your best choice. \n Realize that Disney's Hollywood Studios mostly tries to give people the "lowdown" on how certain things of the movie industry are produced for use on the big screen. They do have a few thrill rides here, but the thrill ride sector is still in it's infancy here.\n Disney's Hollywood Studios doesn't have a monorail station to this park, so you'll either have to take a car or Disney's Magical Express bus to this park. The address to the Disney Hollywood Studios is located at 351 South Studio Dr, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830.. The cost to park your car at the Magic Kingdom will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle). Depending on how far into the lots it took you to get to park, you could be located in either the Film, Music, Stage, or Television parking lots that are located on campus. , Take a map and review your options in each area. \n Pass through and to the right at the first corner, as the hub of the park will be slightly straight ahead after this section has come and gone. \n This section is filled with two major "wild" thrill rides this park carries. \n Brave it, and entice yourself into riding. \n Both of these two buildings are at the farthest edge of this section of the park. \n Fantasmic, the Disney Hollywood Studios nighttime spectacular show down along another long stretch of walkway here can be seen on most nights (even further out than the Tower of Terror). \n Near the hub you will find this area called "Echo Lake". It has a marsh-like lake with a green dinosaur named Gertie, which houses an ice cream shop. He was added here as a tribute to a lesser known animation, but was one of Walt Disney's primary influencing sketches., You'll hear and get to sing along with a few favorites from the Frozen movie. , This building is located right next to the building for "Frozen Sing-Along Celebration". After the show, usually you will hear an announcement inviting you to go meet the snowman., But be careful, as there are two separate rides nearby to one another - one is more thrilling than the other rather tame line ride. Don't try to scare your little ones if and when you go on the scary line. Warn the Disney Cast Member, otherwise you'll be put on the wrong one and end up scaring those young ones who shouldn't have been "scared" to begin with. \n The two lines do come together past the point of the scare to present the history of movie-making. \n You'll see a limited number of attractions there. \n If you do mind, you can pass this and continue on walking towards Streets of America. \n You'll come to a section of the park called Streets of America. \n Muppet Vision 3D, while well inspired by the antics of The Muppets from The Muppet Show is very funny, it is well liked by all who come for a visit. \n Action! Super Stunt Show that features several "takes" of cars and dangerous activities you wouldn't traditionally see. All people portrayed are actors who know their skit/routine well and know just how to perform these tricks without injuring themselves, and have protectant on as a "just in case" measure for the scenes involving fire. \n In one area you'll see the next and last of two more sections. \n You'll watch commentaries on Walt in Walt Disney: One Man's Dream. \n

"All ages" or "Over 18's only". This is important as your patrons may be asked for ID at the door. \n Next you can put whether alcohol will be served at the gig or not. \n After that, you can put "Right of Admission Reserved". This will cover you or the gig organizer in the case of not allowing someone in, for one reason or another. \n These three details may be smaller print, as they are important, but are only on the poster for legal reasons. \n As you are the person who made the poster, you may be asked to make posters for people in future and this can help with a bit of self advertisement. \n are simple but effective on your poster.

 Anodizing works particularly well with aluminum, so, if careful, you can do it at home. Use small aluminum pieces to begin with so that you can submerge it in small quantities of acid.\n Choose a type of plastic that is extremely hard and durable. \n During the anodizing process, you can dye the metal almost any color. This is the process Apple uses to color iPods. You can also buy special dye for anodizing that may produce better results. \n The battery acid may be hard to find; however, it is usually available at auto parts stores. A large battery charger should work as a constant power supply. \n (44 ml) of lye in 1 gallon (3.8 l) of distilled water. Use a smaller plastic tub or discarded metal bowl. Allow it to sit for 3 minutes, then remove it and rinse it well. \n The lye will remove any existing anodizing on the surface of the metal. Once it is removed, water should pour off the surface easily, instead of beading. \n Wear rubber gloves whenever working with lye. \n Do not use measuring spoons or cups that are used for food products. The materials used in this process are toxic. \n Set it on a piece of plywood and/or a thick drop cloth in case of spills. \n For best results, do this when the indoor temperature is between 70 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 22 degrees Celsius). \n Set it on a non-flammable material, like concrete, and make sure it is working consistently. \n You will need to connect the positive wire from your battery charger or rectifier to a wire that will be strung to your aluminum. \n You will need to connect your negative wire from your battery charger to an aluminum wire connected to 2 lead cathodes. \n 12-gauge aluminum wire works well for this use. Wrap it or connect it to the part on a place that is hidden. \n The area of the part that connects to the wire will not anodize. \n Make sure it is very tightly wrapped for a more consistent charge. \n This will give you leverage to lift it out when you are done. Make sure you have extra wire extending toward your power supply after you wrap it. \n Test the wooden handle to ensure your aluminum part will be fully submerged in the acid mix. \n String aluminum wire between the cathodes and connect them together on your small wood plank. You will attach the negatively charged power supply to this wire. \n Make sure the wire connecting the aluminum part and the lead cathodes does not touch. , The amount you use will depend upon the size of the metal part you want to anodize. Be very careful not to spill. \n Always pour the water in before the acid. If you spill any acid, cover it quickly with baking soda. \n Put on a mask or respirator before you start working with acid. Turn on a fan to ventilate the area. \n Connect the aluminum wire that leads from the lead cathodes to the negative charge supply. \n Slowly turn it up. You will want to use 12 amps per square foot of material. \n Increasing the power too fast or using too much can burn your aluminum wires. \n You will see little oxidation bubbles start to form on the surface of the aluminum. It will also start to change color, turning brown, then yellow. \n Mix with distilled water and heat it to 100 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 60 degrees Celsius). \n Remove the metal part and rinse it with distilled water. \n Let it sit for 15 minutes. \n Remove the aluminum part from the dye and place it in the boiling water for 30 minutes. , The surface should be sealed and dyed. \n 
 In the USA "five-year survival rates" (perhaps in remission, or not) for some cancers, such as breast, prostate, and thyroid cancers, now exceed 90 percent.The inability to detect pancreatic cancer earlier with simple screening tests is a huge problem; as such, it has become an important focus of medical research today. \n The reason that there are no useful cancer "blood-screening test" available for the general population (those who are not at high risk) are because the current blood tests being considered by medical professionals are not reliable or accurate, and they provide no significant improvement at detecting pancreatic cancer early. \n The other screening options (those that directly visualize the pancreas and are offered to high risk people) are more accurate but are too costly to the patients and medical system for general use. \n This makes it to unlikely for the patient to ask for a diagnose as it does not cause one to feel sick, and also much harder to diagnose such pancreatic cancers in a timely manner. Also for most patients with this (sneaky) exocrine pancreatic cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.A hopeful cure for a rare, malignant pancreatic tumor type, arising from islet cells, "neuroendocrine (PNET)," has a much better prognosis than pancreatic exocrine cancers with approved medications for them., He or she can then order investigative tests to determine whether or not it is cancer. Common symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: \n Yellow discoloration of your skin and of the whites of your eyes (called "jaundice") caused by high liver enzymes such as bilirubin (red-bile) \n Pain in your upper abdomen that may radiate to your back and back of the rib cage \n Unexplained weight loss, because of sugar metabolism problems caused by the diseased pancreas \n Decreased appetite, as food taste differently if you have yellow jaundice. \n The purpose of the blood test would be to test for some sort of marker(s) that are shown to be correlated with a heightened risk of pancreatic cancer. \n Those who are deemed to be at heightened risk from the screening blood test would then receive more detailed testing from their physician, to determine whether or not there is in fact any cancer present. \n Hopefully in the near future enough information will be gathered for the medical community to come up with effective tests that can be made available to the general population to screen for pancreatic cancer. \n 
 It will be next to impossible to drill downward under the portion of the roof that slopes to the attic floor, without a "right-angle drill".\n Some exterior walls are more accessible above one basement wall than another due to the way floor joists are installed. Either way, room to drill up from below will be required, unless opening the finished wall above to drill down is acceptable. \n Clip one end at about a 45 degree angle to form a long "drill bit" \n and while loosely guiding the bit with one hand, apply even pressure with the other holding the drill while running it. If drilling up, through the ceiling, expect to pass through a thin coat of plaster and 5/8" of sheet rock and 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of strapping to which the sheet rock is secured. After that, drilling should be noticeably easier. You may need to withdraw the drill and clip the end again to make a new sharp edge. Continue drilling until 6 inches (15.2 cm) or so have been pushed into the hole. Once through - do NOT pull the drill out - unchuck the "bit" and leave in place. \n Once 2 inches (5.1 cm) have been penetrated, it should be much easier to drill. Continue drilling until 6 inches (15.2 cm) or so have been pushed into the hole. If not it is possible that the drill bit aligned with a floor joist. Do not pull the bit out - but unchuck it from the drill instead and leave in place. \n Locate the the "bit". Remove any insulation in the general area to make the bit easier to locate. If unable to locate the bit, repeat the drilling process after moving to a spot a couple of inches away from the first hole. \n If the correct direction is chosen, it would be "back" into the wall space, as opposed to 2 inches (5.1 cm) in front of the wall space - in the ceiling. \n This bit should be at least as long as the amount of the coat hanger "bit" that was needed to penetrate the space. \n Balance the speed of the bit and the pressure applied on the drill as needed. Avoid high speed drilling operation as if things go wrong, they'll happen much quicker at high speed (and do more damage as a result)! \n Push in as much as needed plus a couple of feet to reach the desired location. Go to the living space and determine where the snake is while a helper shakes the snake in the wall space. \n Reach into the space and grab the snake. If unable to grab the snake, make sure it has been pushed far enough into the hole and have the helper shake the snake again until you are able to grab it. \n Have the helper pull the snake out of the hole. \n
 Measure above the bust, at your armpits, pulling the tape as tight as possible. \n You may see some flesh puckering under the tape. This is normal. \n This measurement is taken tightly, because you want the band of your bra to be very snug. \n If you do not measure exactly to the inch, round up.\n \n Don’t pull the measuring tape too tight. \n If you do not measure exactly to the inch, round up. \n For every inch difference, go up a cup size. 1” would be an A cup, 2” a B, and so on. \n If your cup size is greater than a D, different manufacturers will classify your cup size differently, so you may have to try different cup sizes when you fit bras. , It's important to realize that the size of the cup will increase along with the band size, and vice versa. For example, the cup of a size 36C bra will be bigger than the cup of a size 34C bra. So: \n If you want to try a smaller band size, you’ll need to compensate by choosing a larger cup size. For example, if you find the band on a 36B bra is too loose, go for a 34C instead. \n And if you want to try a larger band size, you’d need a smaller cup. For example, if a 34B is too tight around the band, try a 36A. \n Lift the front up as high as it will go, without sliding over the front of your breasts. \n This will make sure the back stays low, for proper support. \n This will make sure you get lift in front, where you want it. \n Start from just behind your armpits, and push as much as you can into the cup. \n Breast tissue is soft, and if your bra fits properly, should stay where you put it. \n Grasp the front of the bra and jiggle slightly to settle everything into place. \n With a properly fitted bra, the apex of your breasts should be approximately halfway between your elbow and your shoulder. \n Doing so can make the bra uncomfortable, and this can affect your mood and posture. \n Never tighten the straps so much that they put pressure on your shoulders. This will cause you to slouch forward. \n Never tighten the straps so they pull the bra up at the back. Keeping the back low is important for adequate support in front. \n When buying a bra, hook into the loops at the very end of the band. This gives you a way to tighten the bra as it stretches out over time. \n Your breast size will change along with other changes in your body. \n Get fitted every time you lose or gain more than ten pounds, or have hormonal changes such as with pregnancy or hormone therapy. Many lingerie stores and departments offer free professional fitting. \n Don’t be embarrassed! These women are usually very kind and professional, and have seen it all before.Try to get fitted at a store with a wide range of brands and sizes, otherwise the information you get might be limited to what the store actually sells. \n While bras are widely available, most stores cater to “average” sizes. Find a store or a brand that is particularly suited to your body type. \n If you have a hard time shopping in department stores, consider going to specialty lingerie stores or ordering online. \n Don’t feel pressured to buy in any store, or from a particular salesperson. There are many options to choose from! \n Bras can be expensive, but it’s important not to sacrifice good fit for the sake of paying less. \n An ill-fitting bra is not worth buying. It will eventually make you uncomfortable, both physically and psychologically. \n Plan to have less bras in your wardrobe, if necessary. Buy bras that are versatile, such as “convertible” styles, or ones with removable straps. Thinks about the color of the clothes in your wardrobe and aim to buy bras to match. \n Your size is just a starting point, as sizing can vary and every bra will fit a little bit differently. Take the time to try it on in the store and make sure it’s right. \n When shopping for bras, plan to spend a fair amount of time in the store choosing and fitting bras. Don’t be frustrated if you don’t find the right fit right away. \n If you order online, make sure the site you buy from has a good return policy. \n The shape of your breasts and torso are unique. Depending on your particular proportions, certain styles will look better on you than others. \n Your bra will look better if it flatters the overall proportion of your torso. Ideally, your shoulders should look about the same width as your hips. \n If your shoulders are broad, try to find bras with narrower set straps, and a shape that plunges more in the middle. \n If your shoulders are narrow, consider bras that create a more distinct horizontal line across your torso. \n If your torso is short, a bra that plunges more in the middle can elongate your torso. \n Consider the shape of your breasts. There is a wide variety of breast shapes and sizes. To understand how to classify your breasts, look at this guide. \n Put your arms above your head and twist left and right at the waist. \n The bra should neither ride up nor pinch at this point. If the band slips, try a smaller size. If it cuts in, it's too tight. \n If you're trying on a sports bra, jog in place or jump up and down as well to test if it can control 'bounce' comfortably. \n Bend over. If your breasts are falling out, then the bra doesn't fit. \n There are plenty of add-ons that can make your bras more comfortable. \n Everyone has one breast larger than the other. Adjust each strap to the correct length, and consider padding one side. \n If your bra band is too tight, consider purchasing a band extender. \n If your straps hurt because they're cutting into your shoulders, you may benefit from strap padding. \n If the straps keep falling off your shoulders, consider a clip to hold them together in the back. \n If you’re unhappy with your body, bra shopping can be a truly unpleasant experience. However, it's important to remember that every woman's body is unique, but bras are mass produced. No bra can ever be made to look good on everyone. \n Remember that even with a perfect body (if such a thing exists) an ill-fitting, unflattering bra can do a woman a great disservice. \n If something doesn't suit you, remember that you can always wear something else. Refrain from passing judgement on yourself. \n If you’re having a hard time finding a bra, this doesn't mean you are ugly or strangely shaped. It just means you’re different. \n \n The cup: The part where your breasts fit into. It’s usually made of stretchy fabric, and can have up to three tailored seams. \n The band: This is the elastic part that goes all the way around your chest. \n The wings:These are the portion of the band that extend from the end of the cups to the center of the back. \n The strap:These go over the shoulders and are often adjustable, and sometimes padded. \n The closure: This is usually a hook and eye set at the center back. However it can also be in front, or absent. \n The center gore: This is the part between the cups in the front. \n If you appear to have four, you have what is called the “quad boob effect.” \n This indicates that the cups are too small, and there's not enough room inside. \n This is especially apparent if you try your shirt on over your bra. \n If it does, this means that the band is too loose. \n Try raising your arms and bending backward a bit to check if this happens. \n Remember, when you go up a band size, go down a cup size. \n If it won’t, then the bra doesn't fit. \n This could be because the underwire is the wrong shape for your breasts. \n It could also indicate that the cup size is either too large or too small. \n You should be able to run your fingers around under the edge of the fabric. \n If you can pull it away from your back by more than a couple of inches, it's too loose. \n If the band digs into your sides, to the extent that it causes pain after wearing it, the band is too small. \n If the band rides up, try loosening the straps. If this doesn’t work, the band is too big. \n This does not necessarily mean the band is too tight. \n Instead, look for bras that have a wider band or a “leotard band” to create a smoother silhouette. \n Unless the band is causing you pain, don’t go up a band size, otherwise you will not have enough support. \n This could also indicate that the cup size is too small.Another solution is to wear a body shaping undergarment. \n This could mean that the cup size is too big, the style is wrong, or that you have not put the bra on properly. \n Try adjusting your breasts to make sure they are centered in the cup. \n This could also mean that the bra is not right for your breast shape. \n If your breasts are fuller at the bottom than at the top, you may need a differently shaped bra, such as a “demi cup” or “balcony” style bra. \n This can cause pain, and other problems. \n Straps that dig into your shoulders can cause long term problems, such as headaches, back pain, permanent indentations, and even nerve damage. \n Try looking for bras with wide, padded straps, especially if you have larger breasts. \n Shoulder pain could also indicate that the band is too big, and not providing enough support. The support should come from the band, not the straps. \n If you’ve adjusted the straps and they still keep falling, try a different bra. \n Petite women and women with sloping shoulders often have this problem. \n Make sure the straps are set close enough together and are fully adjustable. \n Underwires that are fitted properly should not cause any pain or discomfort. \n If the cup is too small, the underwire may not fit comfortably under your breasts. \n Also, your individual breasts may not necessarily be the same shape as the manufacturer’s underwires. \n You may have trouble wearing underwires if you have a higher rib cage. \n Underwires are not recommended for pregnant women or women undergoing surgery. \n Some medical conditions may also make it inadvisable to wear underwires. \n Bras without underwire can be just as supportive, even if you have larger breasts, as long as the fit is correct. \n 
 To move forward and redefine yourself, you will have to begin with understanding who you are at this point in time. Look at your life objectively: \n Ask yourself what your values, goals, and dreams are. You can start by creating a list, or use a personal assessment exercise to narrow them down.Consider what you are actually prioritizing in your life right now, and see if it matches who you want to be. \n Avoid self-criticisms and negative statements towards yourself. This will not help you achieve your goals and drag you down.\n Think about how you spend your time when you are alone. This is often provides insight on what you really value, and who you want to be. \n To get an idea of how you use your time, make a rough schedule of how you spend your week, listing all of your activities and obligations. \n Make a list of your hobbies, special interests, etc. \n Consider if your schedule contains any surprises. For instance, are you spending very little time on a hobby or interest that you find very important? Too much time on something you don't like doing? \n When analyzing who you currently are, it might be helpful to talk to yourself about yourself in the third person. Doing so can switch your mind into a more objective way of thinking, thereby allowing you to perceive yourself more accurately. \n Imagine that you are at a party, in a classroom, or some other situation, having a conversation. Each participant in the conversation represents a different part of you, or a value you hold.Play out the scenario in your head; what would that conversation be like? How would it show compassion and love for yourself? \n No one is too old or too established to reinvent him or herself.Change is a part of life and can be a positive thing if you use it correctly. Be prepared to grow and adapt at every stage of life. \n Ask yourself which aspects of your life are being influenced by past hurts, insecurities, and regrets. Once you identify those issues, commit to letting them go so that they no longer control who you are.Write out the things that frustrate you, or that you think hold you back. Expressing your feelings can help you let go of anything unpleasant in your past. This type of list can help you learn about the skills you need to develop in order to feel fulfilled. \n Realize that whatever your regrets are, in some ways you are better off than others. Focus on your strengths and other positive things you take away from your past. \n In order to reinvent yourself, it is important not to dwell too much on the past. However, there are often lessons you can take away from the past that can improve who you are in the present. \n Analyze a relationship that ended painfully to determine what went wrong. Think about what you can do to prevent the same thing from happening in your next relationship. \n Look at which decisions led you or your family to make financial mistakes in the past.Based on this, work to develop a financial plan for the future that corrects these errors. \n Correcting bad habits is an important part of leaving the old you behind. It can, however, be very difficult and even intimidating. Instead of trying to change yourself all at once, focus on breaking one bad habit at a time. \n Make a list of the habits that really bother your. Narrow it down to the top few that you would like to break, then start by working on the most important one. \n Focus on the positive feelings that you first have when trying to break a bad habit.This can help you succeed. \n Try replacing a negative habit with a positive one. For example, if you have a habit of snacking on junk food, replace it with healthy snacks, or spend more time exercising. \n As soon as a negative thought about yourself or your life pops into your mind, try replacing it with a positive one. Doing so trains your mind to focus on possibilities instead of difficulties.Conceptualize the things that cause you to feel stress. Think about how you have responded to them in the past. \n Then, actively replace negative thoughts about those stressors with positive ones. \n For instance, a bad date might cause you to think something like, “I'll never find someone. There must be something wrong with me.” Correct yourself with something like “This date went poorly, but that doesn't mean the right person isn't out there waiting for me. I won't find that person unless I keep looking.” \n If you really want to redefine yourself, however, you'll need to become the person you want to be, not the person someone else expects you to be. \n You also need to identify and step away from social pressure that comes from society itself. Society may hold certain expectations of you based on your race, gender, economic class, or religion, and these expectations can be just as restricting. \n \n Commit to rearranging the way you act out your priorities so that it matches the way you view those priorities in your mind. \n Consider classifying your priorities based on several categories: personal, financial, educational, etc. Then, rank these categories to decide what goal you most want to achieve. \n Your personality develops continually, even in adulthood.Decide who you want to be at your core and identify the personality traits that version of yourself possesses in excess. These personality traits can be ones you already have or ones you've never demonstrated. Examples include: \n Confidence \n Leadership skills \n Self-reliance \n Empathy \n Self-awareness \n Return to the list you made of your frustrations and challenges. Focus on learning how to overcome those frustrations by first identifying the skill you need in order to excel. Then work on developing steps to achieve those goals. If you want to be a business executive, what will it take to get there? What skills will you need? \n Your plan might looks something like this: \n 1. Buy a good professional business wardrobe, even for dress down days. \n 2. Develop leadership skills by taking classes and/or reading books. \n 3. Get your MBA and even a doctorate. \n 4. Work on developing communication skills, either with reading or classes, including conflict management and resolution. \n 5. Learn how to keep a cool head. \n Use this plan as a starting point. Research what it will take to develop those skills, and expand your plan further by adding more steps. \n Once you set a goal, you actually have to make time to pursue it. Start immediately and consistently pursue your goal a little each day. If you manage your time well, you have a higher chance of meeting your goals.For instance, you may plan to improve your health through exercise. Instead of telling yourself, “I'll start tomorrow” or “I'll start next week,” start today. Do a little exercise each day (say, for 15 minutes), even when you don't feel like it. That way, working toward your goal becomes an ingrained habit. \n Likewise, instead of wishing that you had more time to pursue your creative side, actually schedule time for it. Set a goal for the amount of time you want to dedicate each month to creative pursuits. Alternatively, set a goal for how much creative work you want to get done within a month regardless of the amount of time you spend on it. \n By thinking and acting in new ways, you’ll be more creative and step out of your comfort zone. For instance: \n Try a cuisine you’ve never had before. \n Visit a new city or country. \n Read a book on a topic that’s unfamiliar to you. \n Watch a television program you’ve never considered before. \n Pick up a hobby or skill you’ve always dreamed of having. \n Ask yourself if there are any dreams or passions you stopped making time for. If there are, renew your interest in them. You may rediscover a positive trait or skill that is worth keeping as you reinvent yourself. For instance: \n If you once dreamed of becoming a chef, try taking cooking lessons, even if you no longer have any intention of switching careers now. \n If you loved playing basketball when you were in high school, find an adult sports league you can join. You may make friends and rekindle some appreciation for dedication, fitness, and teamwork. \n The people in your life now are familiar with the current you and may or may not assist you as you redefine yourself into someone new. As you meet new people, tell them about the person you're trying to become so that they can help you stay accountable to your ideal. \n Make sure that the new people in your life have positive attitudes. It is much easier to pursue a new you when you're surrounded by positivity instead of negativity. \n Respect your family or current friends who can support you as you reinvent yourself. \n In addition, you can reconnect with old friends, using social media, networking events, etc.Getting in touch with your past can sometimes be the best way to move forward. \n As soon as you are awake enough to think straight, ask yourself if you are the same person today as you were the day before. Reflect on which parts of your self-definition are transforming into something better and which aspects still need a little work. Doing this in the morning can improve your health and make you more mindful throughout the rest of the day., Try not to change everything all at once since doing so can overwhelm you and make you want to quit. Don't procrastinate, but don't rush yourself either. \n 
 Nobody wants to hang out with some poser scene kid. Listen to the music while following the steps below. \n If you like metal, listen to Death-core/Metal-core bands like Bring Me the Horizon, Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin, Asking Alexandria, and the Acacia Strain. \n If you're more interested in pop, listen to something still electronic-based and danceable but edgier than a soccer mom would listen to like Panic At The Disco, Hellogoodbye, Lady Gaga (Yes, really) and deadmau5 if you like Dubstep. \n Want something mellow/soft? Try indie like Death Cab For Cutie, Ellie Goulding, LIGHTS, and Foxtrot. \n If you're looking for something in between, try post-hardcore & Screamo. Examples include A Sky lit Drive, Sky Eats Airplane, Escape the Fate, Breathe Carolina (electronic), Attack Attack, etc. \n A good website to go on to find bands is www. taste-kid.com. It has you type in a band you already like, and it'll give you even more suggestions.\n The most important part of the scene look is the hair. You can get away with any clothes as long as your hair is perfect. The typical scene hairstyle is unisex and works for all lengths/hair types. Just make sure you have short layers at the top and side bangs. Cut them yourself if you can. Girls can also have straight bangs. Don't forget to get your hair thinned out. \n Straighten your hair completely flat. If your hair seems frizzy, add shine serum. If you're a boy with longer hair, stop here because you're done. Everyone else, grab those teasing combs. Only tease the uppermost shortest layers if you have short hair. If you have long hair, tease the upper half of your head. Everybody also don't forget to hairspray! Obviously, don't tease your bangs. \n Guys should never ever wear a ponytail. Short haired girls are allowed to skip the teasing step and wear a deer tail.Girls with long hair can wear a ponytail with all of the hair tied to either side of you, directly behind your ear, and your bangs remaining in their original place. Girls with any hair length can wear pigtails. \n When styling hair, it is important that all hair on the front part of your head remain flat. Use your ear as a guide. Nothing in front of it should be moved when creating your hairstyles. \n Sure, you can go ahead and dye your whole head green but it's a lot easier/healthier/trendier to add a few streaks of any color into your hair using extensions. Fashion core needs to be up to the minute, so this is the way to go. At the moment neon is in style, but check out hair on the runways to see what's in the next season. Also, some people add coontails to their hair, which will probably be on the outs by the time you'll read this. Either go to your local hair supply store and buy the extensions or go to Sally's or even buy them on Myspace. You can glue them to your hair or clip them in. Just make sure to trim the extension to the length of your actual hair when doing streaks. Make it look real. Its not that difficult. \n Buy tightest pants possible. Add tight graphic tee, band tee, or v neck. Go to next step. Ladies have the real options. Here are a few looks a scene girl could try out: \n A casual look can be skinny jeans in a black/light wash/ripped/neon variety with a tight graphic or band tee. \n You could substitute t-shirts with other tops like beater tanks or regular tanks in the summer. Try one white or black tank with a neon color underneath. \n Another idea for the summer is to swap out the skinny jeans for shorts or Bermudas in black and white with prints. \n A more glam look can be leggings with an oversize graphic or band t shirt. Just make sure the shirt is large enough to cover your crotch but not so large that it is actually a dress. Find the perfect medium between thug tee and baby doll. \n Dresses are also becoming more popular in the 2010/11 scene. The most popular at the moment can be found at Rue 21 and Delia's. \n This is a unisex look. \n In colder climates, bomber jackets and fur puffy vests are OK. \n Limit hats because they crush the hair. If one's needed, choose something bright, beanies, or berets. Scarves and earmuffs are acceptable. \n Seriously, no guy-liner unless you're actually a rock star. You will still need to be flawless. Drink 8 glasses of water each day. It really does clear up skin, even better than Proactiv. (You should still wash your face every night!) Wear colorful nail polish. Really, anything will do. Black is acceptable but overused and expected. Guys should not paint their nails as that is way too 1992 to function. Girls should follow the following makeup guidelines: \n For the casual look, start with whatever you usually use to cover blemishes. Add blush and cheek highlighter. Smooth a white eyeshadow underneath your eyebrow and above your top lash. Then apply a black eyeliner on top and bottom and follow with 2 coats of mascara. \n When getting dressed up, use a color eyeshadow on your lids and follow the rest of the directions for the casual look. The eyeshadow can be black or neon. Use whatever colors compliment your eye color. Use blue for blue eyes, pink for hazel, lavender for brown, and purple for green eyes. Or wear any color, as long as you look amazing! \n When leaving the house without makeup, it is mandatory you wear sunglasses to cover this fact up. \n Unisex shoes are great for casual looks. These include Converse, (although Converse have become far to much of a fad - it's best to steer clear of them.) Vans, Reebok Freestyles, and Nike Dunks. Girls can wear ballet flats or pumps with any outfit and probably get away with it. Flats are getting more and more popular. It's mandatory to own at least one pair of black flats. It's also good to have silver or white. Collect tons of different colors to wear with different outfits. TOMS shoes and moccasins are also becoming more popular. Don't wear boots unless they're flat. \n Girls can wear these for a casual look as well. \n Girls also wear necklaces with over sized pendants as well as bangle bracelets. Light, dressy scarves are acceptable as well. Pearl necklaces and silver necklaces with random pendants on them are great too. Don't wear those gummy or rubber band bracelets as they are truly passe. An actual rubber band that really does tie things is an acceptable piece of jewelry for both sexes. \n Girls should also wear a hair bow or a headband. Tiaras are for birthdays only. \n Girls can wear those 3 in 1 belts if they want to glam up. Only wear the ones with snaps instead of the ones that loop through a buckle. \n Also, if you need to wear glasses, they should be plastic. The current trend is to get your grandma's old huge plastic frames and get them filled with your prescription. If you don't have those, get prescription Ray Bans. \n You could do something creative with your pictures like give yourself porcelain skin or purple eyes. \n Facial piercings, plugs, and tattoos are scene too. When getting a tattoo, just make sure not to get any tribal tattoos. Nothing in this step is mandatory though. \n Try not to do the hold-the-camera pose, the "oops" face, or the peace sign. Using a self-timer, take pictures of yourself outside, in looking out of a window, or write your best friend's name on your palm. Upload! Get a high-quality camera instead of just using the camera on your phone. \n Create your own Myspace and be famous with lots of friends. Create proof of yourself using a picture or video. For example, you could have a photo of yourself holding a piece of paper with your URL or a video telling your URL. \n Have you added everyone in your area in your age range? That's a good start, but if you want fame, which you DO, you're going to need a higher friend count than that. Go to friend adding sites. Add kids who look scene. Myspace only lets you add 400 people a day, so hop to it! Strive for a six figure friend list. Nothing in this step is mandatory. Fashion-core is about fashion. NOT about having a bazillion friends on Myspace. This actually has NOTHING to do with it, but it may help. \n Add all the bands you liked on Myspace and find what dates they are coming to your town. Go to every show you can even if its local. You need to be seen to be Scene. Make sure to post bulletins telling people what show you're at and tell people to say hi to you if they see you. Bring a friend so you don't look lame and make sure you look your absolute best. Learn to do the dances you see at the shows. If you have a band, talk to the band after the show. They probably know people who can get you gigs. Again, nothing in this step is mandatory. If you're not overly obsessed with music and going to shows, you don't have to. Be yourself. Don't try to be something you're not, or you will be labeled as a poser. \n An iPod touch works well too. Decorate it by adding small rhinestones, using Sharpies, and adding cell phone charms. The more cell phone charms, the better! \n Doing this ensures that everyone knows where all the action is at. After a fun night, post a blog detailing all the upscale things you did. They don't need to be upscale, just make them seem like they are. For example, if you go to McDonald's, say you went to a restaurant with friends. Don't divulge every detail of your life. Make yourself seem mysterious. \n If you do it too often or too little, people will find you boring. Try to post pictures with your hot friends, but just make sure you are the best looking one in the picture. \n Try not to watch television if possible. Go to coffee shops, techno clubs, shows, the mall, the movies, whatever. Just don't be boring. \n Also read NYLON and Miss Behave magazines. \n Just because it's scene to listen to a certain band does NOT mean you have to if you don't want to. \n 
 Take a t-shirt and tuck the sleeves inside. Place the shirt onto a large sheet of cardboard and trace around it with a pen, making it longer at the hem. Put the shirt away when you are done. \n You are making the chest plate longer because you will be cutting it apart and overlapping it. \n You can also use craft foam or EVA foam. The type used on yoga mats may also work.\n Draw 7 horizontal lines across your pattern to divide it into 8 equal-sized sections. These will make the overlapping horizontal plates. \n The top piece will be F1 and the bottom piece will be F8. This will help you keep track of your pieces. The "F" will strand for "Front." You will be making another set of plates for the back shortly, Lay the pattern pieces out on a sheet of fake leather. Trace around them, adding ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) seam allowances. Cut the fake leather out, then clip the corners to help reduce bulk.Cut notches into the collar of the top piece. This will prevent wrinkling. \n Number the fake leather pieces on the back so that they match up with the cardboard pieces. \n Lay a piece of fake leather on a flat surface, wrong side up. Coat it with glue, then place a matching cardboard piece on top, number side up. Wrap the edges of the fake leather around the edges of the cardboard piece. Repeat this process for the other pieces.You may need to secure the edges with a fast-dying glue, such as hot glue. \n If the fake leather won't stay down, you can secure it with clips. \n This time, number the pieces B1 through B8. You will also want to make the shoulders on the back piece longer. This will make the chest plate easier to assemble. \n You can use a similar method to make upper arm pads and a paneled skirt. Make these using a rectangle base. \n You can do this with a hammer and a nail. Each narrow edge needs to have two rows of six holes. Make the holes towards the bottom half of the collar piece (F1). Make the holes towards the top half of the other pieces (F2 through F8). This will allow you to overlap them upwards, like reverse shingles on a roof.You can make more sets of holes down the middle of each chest plate segment for more detail., Cut two long pieces of colored cording. Thread the cords through the first set of holes. Start from the front of the piece so that the cords come out the back. Leave a couple of inches of cording at the front; you'll need this to assemble the armor.Don't worry about the right side of F1 just yet. \n Cross the left cord over and thread it down through the next right hole. Cross the right cord over and thread it down through the next left hole. They should form an X shape., Bring the left cord up through the next left hole. Bring the right cord up through the next right hole. You do not need to cross the cords, since this is the back of the piece., Make sure that the top edge of F2 is covering the bottom edge of F1. Push the cords up through the first set of holes on F2.Don't worry about the right side of the plates just yet. \n Cross the cords, right over left, and bring them down through the next set of holes. Push them up through the left set of holes on F2, and up through the first set of holes on F3. Keep lacing the pieces in this manner until you reach the bottom of F8., Leave a couple of inches/centimeters on each cord. This will allow you to tie the armor together at the waist. \n Once you have that done, you can lace the back plate together. Punch two holes into the top edge of each shoulder on the back piece so that you can assemble the armor later. \n Thread the cord tails from the top of the chest plate (F1) through the holes on the shoulder straps of the back piece (B1). Tie the cords together on each shoulder into a tight knot. If you don't plan on adding any other pieces, trim them off. \n If you made arm pads and a skirt, you can lace them together in a similar fashion. \n If you made arm pads, use the tails from connecting the shoulder straps to secure them. The cords into knots, then trim them off., Buy a hard hat from the store, and paint it black using spray paint. You don't have to paint the inside, but you should paint the underside of the brim., The strips need to be long enough to extend from the top of the helmet down to the brim. Use a craft blade and a straight edge to make the strips neat and straight. Plan on making them about ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) wide.You can also use gold cording or ribbon instead. \n You can do this with spray paint or acrylic paint. You only need to paint one side, but you should paint the top and side edges. \n If you used gold cord or ribbon, you can skip this step. \n Apply the hot glue directly to the back (unpainted) side of foam piece. Press the foam against the side of the helmet. Hot glue sets up quickly, so only work 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) at a time. Glue all of the strips to the helmet, making sure that they are evenly spaced., Find a fancy coat button and paint it gold to match the vertical strips on the helmet. Hot glue it to the top of the helmet. Not only does this act as an ornament, but it helps hide the part where all of the strips connect., Use the same technique and materials as you did for the chest plate. Cut out four rectangles long enough to wrap around half of the helmet's brim; each one needs to be a little longer than the previous one. Cover and lace them together using the same technique as you did for the chest plate. The shortest rectangle goes on top, and the largest goes on the bottom.For added support, add another set of lacing holes down the middle of each neck protector segment. \n If you don't have enough of the base materials left, try one of the following: cardboard, cardstock, poster paper, or craft foam for the base rectangles. \n If you don't have enough fake leather left, you can paint the base material to match the helmet instead. \n There are two ways that you can do this. You can punch holes in the bottom of the helmet, then thread the cords from the neck protector through the holes and tie them into knots. You can also glue the neck protector to the back of the helmet using hot glue or industrial-strength glue. \n This is one of the most important features on a samurai helmet. Cut a circle and a crescent moon shape out of craft foam. The crescent needs to be about the same height as the helmet, or taller. The circle needs to be small enough to side inside the crescent, a few inches across. \n You can also make the crescent using lines that curve inward then out, like horns., Turn the crescent on its side, so that it looks like a U. Place the circle on top, making sure that the bottom edges match up. Hot glue the circle in place.The circle needs to be small enough to fit inside the moon's cusp. \n You can do this with spray paint or acrylic paint. Make sure that you get the edges of the foam as well. If you want to, you can draw details onto the crescent moon, such as a dragon. \n Place a large swirl of hot glue on the back of the crest. Press it against the helmet, right above the front brim. The prongs of the crescent moon should be pointing upwards. \n You can find them in costume shops and online.You can also make your own by buying a full-face mask from the craft store, then doing the following: \n Cut out the mouth in a rectangle shape. \n Cut off the top part, about mid-cheeks and up, but leave the nose bridge intact. \n Cover the mask with paper mache. \n Sculpt over it using paper clay or paper mache paste. Use pictures of real samurai masks for reference. \n Paint the mask black. \n If you added teeth to your mask, paint them white. You can also paint the lips reddish, or another dark color. Some masks have mustaches. Gather some stiff bristles and tie them together in the middle with string. Hot glue the mustache to the upper lip, just below the nose. If your mask didn't come with straps, add a strong piece of elastic to the back so that you can wear it under the helmet.
 Many office supply and discount stores carry this inexpensive kit. (It usually costs about half the price of an average printer cartridge.) You can also find these kits at online retailers.\n (Remember to close your printer lid or door while you are working.) \n Work over the paper towel to catch any leaking ink. \n (The following instructions are just a general guide). \n The depressions can be felt by rubbing your finger across the label. Some cartridges have more than one hole, but only one leads to the ink reservoir that you will refill. This hole will have a sponge in it. \n Follow the kit instructions on which hole to insert each color OR push a toothpick into the holes to identify the colors as markings on the printer cartridge are sometimes there to fool you into putting the wrong colors into the cartridge ink chambers. \n It is important not to push air into the cartridge foam while refilling. (An air pocket will keep the ink from reaching the print head causing the cartridge not to print.) \n Carefully watch to be sure that you do not over-fill. \n Without letting go of the bottle, slowly release the air, sucking a little ink back out of the ink cartridge, before you remove the needle completely. \n (This works better than the seal dots included in the kit.) Make sure that no ink is leaking out of the top holes. (That's where the clear tape comes in handy.) Be careful not to cross contaminate the colors. \n You may need to do this several times. Do this until it stops bleeding and you see an even stripe of three colors showing up on the towel. \n Never, ever install a leaking print cartridge. \n Print several test pages, preferable photos with a lot of different colors. \n
 Drake Hotel - A secret hideout for artists and indie musicians, the Drake Hotel has a sophisticated flavour and a cool nightclub. Located in Toronto's arty design neighbourhood, where galleries, fashion boutiques and interior design shops abound.\n Always packed. Eat the steamed grouper with ginger and the hot-and-sour soup. \n Ematei - A slightly off-the-radar address doesn’t keep bargain hunters from finding this unpretentious spot where three-course dinners (beef teriyaki with soup, salad and rice, for example) can be had for as little as $22. Divider walls framed in strips of dark wood nod to rice paper tradition; steel chairs and multiple bits of kitsch on the walls conjure more Bill Murray’s Tokyo. \n Scaramouche - After more than 25 years, the restaurant is still seducing diners with its luxurious food and understated but powerfully romantic setting. Book early for one of the coveted window seats offering sparkling views of the skyline. The menu luxuriates in delicacies: foie gras, truffle, lobster, veal — often combining many elements into a grand whole. \n Bovine Sex Club (542 Queen St. W.) - A portal to the dark side, for a lot of good reasons. And the dark side in Toronto is dark, like an LA, aluminum-foil-on-the-windows kind of dark. Rock, punk and other happening sounds blare at ear-bleeding decibel levels, while TV screens show a wide range of films. Everything a seedy Queen West bar should be and more, the 15-year-old Bovine has valiantly resisted the war on sleaze that’s been sweeping the rest of the neighbourhood. Bolted to the ceiling is a collage of weird and wonderful knick-knacks, the pièce de résistance of the strange, even menacing décor: gold-painted cherub dolls grin creepily, hanging out among old tires and bicycle wheels. \n Ted’s Collision (537 College St.) The best bar left on College, a house of refuge amid the dross. Ted’s Collision is a great place to drink, but staff, we have a tip for you: We are smart enough to carry on conversations, and we like the company, so lower the music. It’s too loud and you’re driving people away. \n Sweaty Betty’s (13 Ossington St.) A little hole-in-the-wall that serves imported absinthe, sake martinis, and Cheez Whiz on toast. Get falling-down drunk and then wander over to a Vietnamese “karaoke bar” and puke on one of their couches. That goes over really well. They love that. \n How about the name? Hippies founded it in the 60s (OK, maybe a bit later but the myth shall live on). It’s family run. The jewelry is one-of-a-kind. Their cat loves to be petted. This is a bit more than just a shop: it’s the closest thing we will ever get to that better time. And go for a wander around Kensington, there are a lot of other great vintage shops in there like Flashback and Dancing Days. \n A neighbourhood used as the backdrop of several Hollywood films. Check out some local art and have a pint at the Mill Street Brew Pub or a latte at Balzac's Coffee shop. \n (231 Queens Quay West Toronto) - The Power Plant has three major exhibition galleries and smaller, adjacent indoor and outdoor sites which lend themselves to virtually any presentation circumstance. The interior of The Power Plant is comprised of three major gallery spaces. \n - Cosmopolitan Toronto Hotel - A serviced apartment, with kitchens and everything. You'll feel right at home. Another cool thing was the quietness of the hotel. It's tucked in a small street by Yonge and Bay. So, even though you know you are a block away from everything, it's quiet. \n - Kensington Market - Crammed with everything from a cheese store with every imaginable variety (and a few others) to handmade crafts straight out of Nepal to vintage clothing to authentic Jamaican fish vendors, Kensington showcases Toronto's many diverse cultures. \n - The Toronto International Film Festival is the biggest film festival in North America and second to Cannes worldwide. Head to restaurants like Bistro 990, Pangaea Restaurant, Sotto Sotto and the Four Seasons Hotel and see an overwhelming number of stars. \n This downtown location is one of three large Chinese communities in Toronto. Dundas Street West from University Avenue to Spadina Avenue and north to College Street are the boundaries of Chinatown. As the Chinese community has grown, it has extended along Dundas Street and north along Spadina Avenue. Here you'll see a fascinating mixture of old and new. Hole-in-the-wall restaurants share the sidewalks with glitzy shopping centers built with Hong Kong money. \n - CN Tower - As you approach the city, whether by plane, train, or automobile, the first thing you notice is this slender structure. Glass-walled elevators glide up the 553m (1,815-ft.) tower, the second tallest freestanding structure in the world. The elevators stop first at the 346m-high (1,136-ft.) Look Out level. (It takes just 58 seconds, so prepare for popping ears.) \n No food review would be complete without mentioning Little Italy. With the highest Italian population outside of Italy the possibilities are endless, although you might want to start at The Sicilian Café for unparalleled gelatos and tiramisu. \n 
 Like many theme parks, Rainbow's End is busy during the school holidays. Christmas Day is the one day the park is closed but you can expect it to be busy throughout the summer months. Located at 2 Clist Crescent, Manukau, Auckland, some of the park's attractions are weather dependent so if you want to visit in July or August, remember some rides may not be running due to snow, rain or high winds. The park is open from 10:00am to 5:00pm daily.\n The rides and are within the park as a whole or in Kidz Kingdom. \n Events occur frequently, if not regularly. Matariki is recognised, sometimes with celebratory family tickets. \n You'll enjoy your day more if you don't feel like you've missed out. If you're keen to go on rides that don't have lots of seats, like the karts and the log flume, get to those early in the day and work your way toward the rides with more capacity such as Invader or Stratosfear. \n Publicised as the park's scariest ride it is 30 metres high at the highest point, has a 360 degree swing angle and will get the blood rushing to your head as you spin upside down with your fellow 29 riders. \n This ride is a combination of a roundabout, and roller coaster! You'll spin around whilst travelling along a 80 metre track at up to 70 km/h (43.5 mph). \n At 18 stories to the top, you will have plenty of time to think about how there’s only one way down! You may of seen this ride on the popular comedy show Jono and Ben. They often attempt to interview celebrities, with varying success, on this ride. \n 18 metres high with three types of rotation, this will put you in a spin. Pick your partner carefully as you'll be sitting side by side, isolated from the other 22 riders. \n Try the Corkscrew Roller coaster. At a maximum of 45 kilometres per hour you'll drop, loop and go thorough not one but two corkscrews]] \n At Rainbow's End these are: \n Log Flume \n Gold Rush Roller Coaster Ride \n Pirate Ship \n Dodgems \n Scorpion Cars (Go karts) \n There's Comfy Land and Tiny Tots for those who like to just play not ride and check out the Dixie Chickens Show if you just want to relax and watch something for a while. \n Factor in transport costs, eating at the park, purchasing souvenirs and accommodation if you don't live nearby or need to travel home more than a few hours. \n Check the website for family and group deals. Often, you can save money not paying for tickets at the gate and you will save buying online. \n Remember branded food, packets of chips for example, are not permitted, unless they are for park guests with special dietary requirements. Make your own sandwiches, pies, sausage rolls etc or take your favourite brands out of the original packaging. \n
 In order to be a binding contract, the commercial lease must include all parts of your agreement, in writing. If you and the landlord discuss something that you believe is an important part of the deal, then write it into the lease., In case there is any dispute in the future, your lease must be a document that can be read and understood by someone unrelated to your deal. It must include the following clear identifications:The names of the parties. Both you and the landlord must be named. If either of you is operating as a corporation, you will need to list it by its name and officers. Otherwise you will probably use your own name. \n The address and description of the property. \n Be precise. Most commercial leases tend to run longer than a single year. If there is to be an opportunity to renew the lease, explain the terms of that renewal. Provide the dates that the lease begins and ends, so there can be no confusion., Specify how much is to be paid, and how often. If payment is expected in any particular form (certified check, etc.), be sure to say so.Note any rent increases that can be expected (called escalations) and whether the tenant will have the option to renew the lease at the end of the term. \n Sometimes a letter of credit from your financial institution can be substituted. If so, state that in the lease. Explain the purpose of the security deposit, when it will be returned, and what circumstances might lead to losing the security deposit., These might include electricity, water, telephone lines and trash removal. If you are making payments to the landlord for utilities, consider including a note about how often the landlord can ask for increases in utility payments., Some commercial tenants will want to make changes to the property before moving in. The lease should identify the work that is to be done, should state who pays for those costs, and should address your recourse if the work is not done satisfactorily or on time., These costs are often shared by landlords and tenants. Be specific about out how those costs will be calculated so there is no confusion for either the landlord or the tenant. Discuss how you will handle increases in the future., Particularly with a startup business, you may in the future find the need to subdivide the space and take on a tenant of your own. Or you may wish to enlist a partner and have that partner take on some of the responsibilities as a subtenant. Discuss these possibilities ahead of time with the landlord and list any conditions., Most commercial storefronts and office buildings have signs identifying who they are. Your landlord might provide those signs, and if so, this should be mentioned in the commercial lease., If the landlord or the tenant has a dispute, there should be a process that each party agrees to follow. At the outset of your business, you probably hope that everything will be wonderful. However, you must anticipate problems and include procedures. Some terms to consider including:What form of notice are you required to provide each other? \n How much notice is either party required to give in order to correct a problem? \n Is mediation required before either party goes to court? \n Is there a limit to the damages that can be claimed? If so, what is the limit and how is it to be calculated? \n A commercial lease is a binding legal agreement, and you cannot expect to get out of it very easily. However, especially if you are operating a new or start-up business, your future may be speculative. Although you hope to be in business for a long time, you may not be able to keep the lease for the full term. When you are drafting the lease, anticipate this possibility and include provisions that would make it permissible to end the lease early.Note any financial penalties or consequences that will be incurred if the landlord or the tenant breaks the lease improperly. \n Although every commercial lease needs to be tailored to your own specific needs and your particular agreement, you can get a good start by using a template. This is a form that includes many of the terms that are required to make a contract binding. A good template can also provide an outline for you and the other party to use in negotiating the terms of your deal. As you review the template and work on filling in the spaces, if you find any that you have not addressed, you may need to have another discussion about your agreement. \n The Internet Legal Research Group, at ILRG.com, provides an online source of commercial lease templates for each of the fifty states.SCORE is a volunteer agency that exists to assist small business owners and entrepreneurs. They provide a commercial lease template as well that you can download., There are a variety of online services that can help you write your lease. If you are doing this on your own, you might be able to use one of these services. You will need to collect all the information for the contract (names, address, terms of the contract, etc.) and enter them into the online program. At the end, you will be able to print out a fully typed lease agreement that incorporates your personalized terms., Whether you use a template that you get from a lawyer, from a book, or from an online service, it is essential that you read the complete contract very carefully. You will want to make sure that the form does not contain language that you and the other party to your agreement did not intend to include. If you do find provisions that you did not expect, consider whether you wish to keep them or strike them out. \n Make sure that the landlord is in agreement with whatever revisions you are making. \n When you have the lease in its final form, and both you and the other party have reviewed it and agree that it says what you want it to, then you both need to sign it. There is generally no requirement that a lease be notarized, but doing so is a low cost and could be helpful down the line in case there is ever a dispute about the validity of the signatures. \n It is a good practice to print a copy of the lease for each party, so that each party will have original signatures. \n File your signed lease in a safe place, so you can refer to it in the future. \n Before you agree to lease commercial property, ask your attorney to look at the paperwork. You should sit together, read through each section, and explain your intentions. An attorney can make sure that what you wrote down will serve the purposes that you intend. \n A commercial lease is like a business partnership. Your landlord wants your business to succeed, so that he continues receiving his rent money. If you are having problems of any kind, or if your needs change, communicate those needs to your landlord. The two of you should work together to resolve any conflict early., You don’t want to find yourself in an emergency situation where suddenly your business site is insufficient. Try to predict your company’s needs in advance by reviewing data, income, expenses, employee needs, customer needs, etc. If you foresee something that was not included in your lease, you may need to make changes to the lease., A commercial lease is a legally binding document, but it is not completely unforgiving. If you and your landlord discuss some situation and reach an agreement that you had not originally anticipated in the commercial lease, you can amend the lease.The amendment should make specific reference to paragraphs or sections of the original lease that are being affected. \n The amendment should include the revised or added language. \n The amendment needs to be dated and signed in the same way as the original lease. \n When you are in business, you are expected to perform at a higher level. Private residential tenants are not expected to have certain business or negotiating skills, so there are more consumer protection laws in place to protect residential tenants. As a business owner, you will be expected to negotiate many of these protections for yourself or hire an attorney.For example, a residential tenant has certain privacy rights that a commercial business tenant will not usually expect. \n Residential leases often exist in standard forms, with certain provisions that will be common to all residences within a geographical area. There are no recognized standard forms for commercial leases. Although there are templates that can help you, each commercial lease is different. You need to review the lease terms carefully and make sure they match your own needs., A commercial lease tends to be for a longer term and is legally binding. While a typical residential lease may be as short as a month or, more typically, a year, businesses tend to remain in place longer, so the lease terms will be longer. You need to know as you enter the deal that you are making a serious commitment.If a residential tenant needs to break a lease early, he or she may lose a month's security deposit, but that is often the extent of the loss. A commercial tenant may face larger consequences depending on how the individual lease is written. \n Commercial leases tend to be open to more negotiability than residential leases. When you are renting a house or apartment, there are often limitations to the work you can expect. But with a commercial space, you may be able to negotiate significant renovations or special features that your business might need. Consider this when you are negotiating the agreement., Before you ever get to the state of drafting a commercial lease, you need to be sure you are fully aware of your needs. Think about your business and its future. Consider the following questions:Is your business likely to grow? Will you need more room in the future than you have now? \n How much visibility will you rely on? Is your business the kind that depends on public foot traffic in order to survive, such as a cafe or bookstore? Or are you content with very limited visibility and the clients will come find you, such as a dental office or private law firm? \n How accessible do you want to be? Do you want to be right in the downtown area of a city, or can you save money and take a more suburban location? \n What special features will your business space need? Do you just need basic office lighting, or are you opening, for example, a laser tag and video game establishment that will need special electrical wiring? \n Is the space you want to rent zoned for the kind of business you want to operate? It is not the landlord’s obligation to make sure that you can operate your business. This is a detail you should investigate before entering into a deal. \n If you are operating a business, one of the usual costs of doing business is legal work. It may seem expensive if you are just starting out, but the cost of consulting with an attorney in the beginning may be much cheaper than getting a commercial lease that does not really fit your needs and then facing a legal dispute later on. \n Just as you would consult with a realtor to rent or buy a house, you can do the same for your business. A realtor may also be able to help you with negotiating the terms of your agreement and drafting a lease. \n When you find a suitable location, talk with the landlord and discuss the terms of your agreement. A commercial lease usually has much more to discuss than a residential lease. Some things to think about are:length of the lease \n rental price \n renovations that you would like before you take possession \n utility payments \n property maintenance \n signage requirements \n early termination possibilities \n 
 If you have federal student loans, you are legally required to complete exit counseling when you graduate, leave school, or fall below half-time enrollment. Different schools may handle exit counseling differently, but whether you have to handle it in person, by mail, or online, it’s an important step in understanding your debt. During exit counseling, you should receive information about: \n your legal rights and responsibilities as a borrower \n various available repayment plans \n procedures for making payments \n conditions that must be met for deferment, forbearance, and forgiveness \n resources available if you have questions or concerns regarding your debt\n Some borrowers believe – erroneously – that they do not have to repay their student loans if they do not graduate. Unfortunately, that’s not the case, and you’ll need to repay your debt whether you completed your degree or not. \n Depending on how long you’ve been in school, how many loans you’ve gotten, and whether your debt is federal, private, or both, you may not have a clear picture of how much student loan debt you’ve accumulated. That’s completely understandable, but you can’t address the issue effectively without figuring out what, exactly, you owe – and to whom. \n You may be receiving notices, either by email or by snail mail, from your lenders or your school’s financial aid office. If that’s the case, keep careful records of these notices, noting what kinds of loans you have (Stafford, Perkins, PLUS, etc.) and who is servicing those loans. \n Whether you’re receiving notices or not, it’s a good idea to do some research on your own to ensure that you’re fully aware of every loan. Start by visiting the National Student Loan Data System at https://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds/nslds_SA/. This website will have information about all your federal loans, even if they were taken out at different times and are being serviced by different companies. If you’ve borrowed through the federal government only, then you don’t need to look anywhere else. If you have private loans, you’ll have to check your records and follow up with those lenders as necessary. \n If this information was not made clear to you during exit counseling, visit the National Student Loan Data System or inquire with your financial aid office. \n In some circumstances, you may have multiple servicers for different loans. For example, you may find that your Stafford Loans are serviced through one company, but your Perkins loans are serviced through another. \n For most forms of federal student aid, you will need to start making monthly payments six months after your graduation date (or after you stop attending). Private lenders may set other deadlines for payments to begin – in fact, they may even require payments while you are still in school. \n For any subsidized federal loans, the government will continue to cover the accumulating interest during this six-month grace period, as it did when you were in school. If you have unsubsidized loans, though, interest will accrue during this time. Be aware that if you do not make payments, you will owe more six months after graduation than you did on graduation day. \n Although federal student aid is awarded regardless of your credit score, understand that if you do not pay, your credit will absolutely suffer – whether your loans are federal, private, or both. \n If you do not make your payments and wind up with bad credit, you will have a much harder time qualifying for other kinds of loans (including mortgages and car loans) later on. \n Bad credit may also make it more difficult to rent an apartment or sign up for certain utilities. You may even have difficulty getting a cell phone plan. \n Many borrowers look, understandably, for the repayment plan with the lowest monthly payments. Know that if you take this route, you’ll be paying significantly more in the long run. For example, say you have $26,946 in federal student loan debt – the average for borrowers who attended a four-year public university:If you pay a standard monthly payment of $272 a month, you will ultimately pay $32,585 on your loans. \n If you pay on a graduated plan, starting with $152 a month and increasing to $455 a month over time, you’ll ultimately pay $33,979 on your loans. \n If you pay on a lower “pay as you earn plan,” starting with $104 a month and increasing to $272 a month, you will ultimately pay $39,509 on your loans. \n Because making smaller payments will increase your overall cost, you should make the standard, recommended payments if possible. Under this plan, you will pay off your student loans completely in ten years. \n In general, unless you request otherwise, your student loan servicer will start you off with the standard repayment plan. \n If you are employed in a steady but somewhat low-paying job, but you can reasonably anticipate periodic promotions and raises, the graduated payment plan might work better for you. You’ll start off with a lower monthly payment, which will go up over time. \n In general, the graduated payment plan will also enable you to pay your loans off in ten years. Check with your loan servicer to see what you individual numbers will look like. \n If your budget is restricted and you don’t anticipate a significant increase in your income, the extended repayment plan may be your best option. Under this plan, you pay off your student loans over the course of twenty-five years. \n Remember that there’s a significant overall cost associated with these lower monthly payments. You will have this debt for much longer, and you’ll pay much more overall. \n Depending on your individual circumstances, you may be eligible for an income-based repayment plan. You must apply for this plan by submitting proof of a low income and showing that other repayment plans would constitute a financial hardship. Individual eligibility varies, so talk to your loan servicer for details. These plans include: \n Income-Based Repayment (IBR). Under this plan, you’ll make payments for twenty-five years, and after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven. Your payments will not exceed 15% of your discretionary income. \n Pay-As-You-Earn Repayment. This is a newer program, which is only available to people who had no student loans prior to October 1, 2007, and received student loans after October 1, 2011. If you qualify, it's a better deal than IBR. Under this plan, you’ll make payments for twenty years, and after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven. As with IBR, your payments will not exceed 15% of your discretionary income. \n Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). Under this plan, you’ll make payments for twenty-five years, and after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven. Your payments will not exceed 20% of your discretionary income. \n Forbearance allows qualifying borrows to hit the “pause” button on their payments. Be aware that your interest will continue to accumulate during this time. Consider applying for a forbearance if: \n you have a sudden financial hardship. \n you develop a serious medical problem that affects your income or your budget. \n you start a medical or dental internship or residency program and cannot make your payments. \n you accept a position with AmeriCorps. \n you begin active duty in the U.S. military. \n You may qualify for a deferment (a period during which you do not have to make payments) for a variety of reasons, but remember that deferments do have costs. In most cases, your loans will continue to accumulate interest, and you’ll pay more over time. Deferments are available for borrowers who: \n attend graduate or professional school. \n are unemployed. \n are experiencing severe economic hardship. \n are serving in the military. \n One of the reasons that federal financial aid is so much more attractive than private student lending is that the government offers all of these possible repayment plans. If you have private debt, you will have to negotiate directly with your lenders, and they may be much less inclined to grant you lower payments or a deferment. \n For federal loans, at least, the variety of payment, forbearance, and deferment options should allow you to avoid defaulting (failing to pay). Don’t ignore your debt. A default will have significant, long-term implications for your credit, and you won’t be able to get any additional financial aid, either. If you do wind up in default, it’s not too late to repair the damage. Talk to your loan servicer, as individual circumstances may vary. In general, though: \n You can get out of default by consolidating your loans with the federal government and making three consecutive monthly payments. Consolidation combines all your loans and revises your payment plan to make your monthly payments as affordable as possible. Of course, this does mean paying more interest in the long run. \n Alternatively, you can simply start making your payments again. Once you have made nine consecutive monthly payments, you will get out of default. This process is called rehabilitation. \n Think of your designated monthly payment as the bare minimum. If you can afford it, you can pay extra without penalty. Doing so will mean that you pay your loan off faster and pay less interest over time. \n For the best results, ask your loan servicer to apply any additional amount to your principal (rather than to future payments). This will ensure that your money makes more of a dent in your loan balance. \n Track all of your income and spending for a few months, and then identify expenses that can be cut. You can then funnel this money into student loan payments, including extra principal payments. Depending on your individual circumstances, this might mean: \n renting a cheaper apartment or living with a roommate \n eating out less frequently \n doing without a car and walking, biking, or taking public transportation instead \n cutting entertainment expenses like movie and concert tickets \n avoiding small extra expenditures at coffee shops and bars \n It may sound obvious, but excelling at your job, earning promotions, and working overtime when possible will improve your overall financial picture and allow you to pay off your student loans faster. \n When you do find yourself earning more, resist the urge to spend that extra money. If you continue to live as if you were receiving a lower paycheck and funnel the extra cash into extra student loan payments, you could save thousands and thousands of dollars and get rid of your debt much more efficiently. \n Depending on your profession and your other circumstances, you may be able to get some of your debt forgiven. Talk to your loan servicer for specific details on the various forgiveness plans and a complete list of restrictions and eligibility criteria. In general, though, you may qualify for at least partial forgiveness if:you teach for five consecutive years in a high need area \n you join AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps \n you join the Army Reserve or the National Guard after graduation \n you are accepted into Teach for America \n you work full-time as a provider of early intervention services for the disabled \n you work full-time providing services to families in low-income communities \n Some employers do offer assistance with student loan repayments. Check into this option to be sure you aren’t missing out on this benefit. \n If at all possible, avoid getting a car loan, a mortgage, or any other type of loan until you have made significant progress on your student loan debt. Though it might feel like a burden to postpone buying a new car or become a homeowner, this approach will absolutely pay off in the long run. \n 
 This will help you organise yourself better and be better prepared.\n Jot down the main topics in the form of points and set targets to study accordingly. \n Take stock of how many days you have left and chart out a schedule. A schedule will help in methodical preparation and ensure that all topics are covered. \n We often tend to neglect subjects which we’re weak at and allocate the least amount of time to them. It’s important to allocate an equal amount of time to each subject. Equal distribution of time to each subject will enable greater chances of scoring high marks in almost all subjects.also ensure you will score the max. at the easy portions. this is also very important. \n They help you anticipate the types of questions which may be included as well as the pattern of the question paper. Practice makes perfect, and these papers are a great way of acing the exam. \n The last few hours are strictly for revision and preparing yourself mentally for the exam ahead. Give your mind rest by doing some breathing exercises a few minutes before the exam. \n Last-minute study doesn’t work for anyone, so dedicate enough time for revision. \n It’s advisable to sleep early in order to wake up fresh and attempt the exam with renewed zeal and enthusiasm. \n Pack your bag with all the necessary stationery and other relevant things the night before. Always carry refills or extra pens. \n Go through the question paper with a cool and calm mind. Scan the paper thoroughly and identify which questions you want to attempt first. With an eye on the clock and confidence in yourself, start solving the paper, knowing that you’re going to come out with flying colours. \n 
 You can acquire them online. You could even buy "sample packets" for the price of 3 dollars from the F.W. Schumacher Company in Sandwich, Ma.\n You may place them in a small, seal-able plastic baggy or other container which won't leak. Keep the container out of direct sunlight. At the end of this period, you will notice that some of the seeds have become swollen. \n This should be the flat that has holes in the bottom for drainage. Place this flat into another flat of the same size, but one which doesn't have drainage holes in it. \n You may sow them closer, but you will be separating them later when they are bigger and stronger. \n You can do this with the screws that come in the packaging and by cutting a two by two inch gap on the lateral sides of the grow dome, near the top. The light should be able to slide right in these holes, protruding outside of each by about 2". \n If direct sun is a problem, use a curtain or white shade cloth to reduce the intensity of the sun a bit. \n 
 The infinitive form always ends in –se, the equivalent of get+adjective,  and become+adjective in English. \n to get tired= cansarse \n to become furious=enfurecerse \n \n \n to get behind with=atrasarse con \n to get between=interponerse \n to get by=agenciarse \n to get down=agacharse \n to get in=meterse, introducirse \n to get near=acercarse \n to get out=salirse \n to get over it=recuperarse \n to get up=levantarse \n These include: \n Despertarse - to wake up \n Bañarse - to bathe \n Ducharse - to shower \n Afeitarse - to shave \n Vestirse - to get dressed \n Peinarse - to comb (the hair) \n Reflexive verb will either express an action we perform that will only reflect upon us, or an action that is exaggerated to a certain degree thus causing a slight change in the meaning of the verb it derives from. An action we perform that will only affect or benefit us; in other words, there is no direct object or indirect object receiving the action. Here are some examples: \n I wake up early=despertarse- yo me despierto temprano \n I stand up=pararse-Yo me paro cerca de la puerta \n I see myself as a…- verse-Yo me veo como… \n I wonder…-preguntarse-Yo me pregunto… \n I get bored easily.-aburrirse- Yo me aburro fácilmente. \n \n I eat twenty oranges=comerse  veinte naranjas   \n I drink 10 glasses of water=tomarse diez vasos de agua \n I ordered a lot of food=pedirse una gran cantidad de comida \n Here are some examples: \n Ponerse estresado= to become stressed \n volverse loco=to go insane \n ponerse triste=to become sad \n volverse egoista= to become selfish \n ponerse bravo=to become angry \n Here are some examples: \n Ella se volvió una persona muy comprensiva. She became a very understanding person. \n Los niños se volvieron excelentes estudiantes.The children became excellent students. \n El señor Pérez se volvió un borracho insoportable.Mr. Perez became an obnoxious drunk. \n Here are some examples: \n Ella era Católica y se volvió Budista. She was a Catholic and she became a Buddhist.· *La Soda se volvió un Restaurante. The small cafetería became a restaurant. \n He turned into a werewolf. Él se volvió un hombre lobo. \n  Here are some examples: \n Ella se hizo enfermera. She became a nurse. \n Juan se hizo farmacéutico. Juan became a pharmacist. \n 
\n Use a screwdriver to take off the hinges as well. \n You can purchase it at any hardware store or home improvement store. \n Let it soften the finish for about 15 minutes. The stripper should cause it to gel. \n Begin at the top of the cabinet and scrape downwards, allowing the finish to fall off the sides of the cabinet. \n Repeat the chemical stripping and scraping on the exterior of all the cabinets you plan to restore. \n Repeat the process on the exterior of the drawers as well. \n Lay the cabinet doors across a sawhorse for the best access. \n Remember to wait 15 minutes after applying the chemical stripper to begin scraping. Scrape from the top to the bottom on the doors, the same way you did on the cabinets. \n Your sanding motion should go parallel with the grain of the oak. \n Continue sanding until there is a smooth feel to the wood. All of the finish should be gone, and there should be no grooves or differences in texture after the cabinet is sanded. \n Remember to sand parallel with the grain of the wood, and continue sanding until the surface is smooth and consistent. \n Dip a staining sponge into a can of oak stain and wipe it over the cabinets generously. As soon as you get the stain onto the cabinets, wipe it off with a dry cloth. \n Stain and wipe the doors and drawers the same way you applied the stain to the cabinets. \n This can often be found in an aerosol spray can for easy application. \n Hold the can 8 inches (20 cm) away from the cabinet and spray evenly in one direction. Continue spraying the entire cabinet going in one direction and then the other (back and forth instead of one end to the other end) until it is covered with lacquer. \n Spray it the same way you did the cabinets. \n The lacquer should look less shiny and feel smooth when you touch it. \n Spray everything the same way you did with the first coat. Let it dry for a full 24 hours. This will allow the finish to set. \n
 Mark the vertical line in several areas on the wall. If your walls or windows appear crooked compared to these lines, consider a random wallpaper pattern so the edges and corners aren’t noticeable.\n Generally, large prints don’t work in small rooms because they make them feel smaller. \n Small prints exaggerate the size of the room, while light colors reflect light, adding to the spacious feeling. \n It is best to use a wall without windows and other fixtures in this case. \n This will allow you to inquire about the best methods and tips for using it. You will be able to call the store if you have any questions throughout the process. \n If you need to order more, they may be able to match the color to the exact printing that you used previously., Each paper is slightly different. When in doubt, use the specific directions rather than general directions for wallpapering. \n To make your own, rest a three by six-foot (0.9m by 1.5m) piece of three-fourths inch (1.9cm) plywood on top of two sawhorses. Sand the corners of the plywood to avoid tearing. \n Basswood and plywood are like a self-healing mat, allowing you to cut into the surface of the paper with a utility knife without ruining the paper. \n Large pieces can be slightly unwieldy. \n You should make a mark every six inches (15cm) or so, to ensure you hang a sheet to be completely level. Don’t trust ceilings, floors, trim or windows, since many of them are hung without being perfectly level. \n You will want to start hanging your wallpaper in the least conspicuous area of the room. \n Cover the floor in drop cloths. The water and paste can drip off the table and onto floors. \n You will need to apply patching compound and sand it if there are holes. Wash the wall with trisodium phosphate (TSP) or a TSP substitute. \n \n For exceptionally uneven walls, you may want to apply special “liner paper” over them before pasting wallpaper. \n Cut it to the length of your wall, adding four inches (10cm) of extra space, or two for the top and two for the bottom. \n This means the prepasted side, usually white side, should be toward the outside., Place it at the bottom end of your worktable. \n Soak it for about 30 seconds, or the time recommended by the manufacturer. \n The patterned/colored side should be facing up. \n They should not be creased, just coerced slightly in toward the pasted side. This is called “booking.” \n During this time, the wallpaper expands. Laying the paper too soon will cause it to expand on the wall and create gaps., Ensure the pattern is right side up. \n Use your plumb marks on the wall to line it up. Then, leave about two inches (5cm) of extra paper above the trim to remove later. \n The size on the walls should allow you to slide it to an exact position. \n Brush the bubbles out toward the sides. Repeat until the wallpaper is smoothed to the wall. \n Always smooth from top to bottom and from the center toward the sides. \n Cut with one clean motion against the top edge of the putty knife using a utility knife. Keep your utility blade as horizontal as possible as you cut. \n Replace the blade after cutting the trim off two pieces of wallpaper. Sharp blades are essential to avoid tearing. \n Make sure you align it with the plumb line and with the previous strips of wallpaper. Pay attention to manufacturer directions on how to match up the pattern. \n Then, cut from the center of the fixture toward the corners. Trim the paper with our utility knife and putty knife. \n

 But, medical reasons aside, the cold from the ice will numb your hand if you keep it in place for long enough. Although the extreme cold will be uncomfortable or even painful at first, push through it and keep the ice in place. Eventually, you’ll feel less sensation — including pain — in the iced area.\n Your first impulse might be to panic, but try not to let yourself get overexcited. Excitement can lead to increased blood flow, which in turn might lead to harmful swelling. Furthermore, research has shown that anxiety leads to a heightened experience of pain, though this is more researched with chronic pain than with acute injury.Regardless, staying calm will help you stay focused and manage your pain in the short term. \n Although for severe injury, you should see a doctor who can both treat your hand and prescribe stronger pain relievers, for manageable situations, OTC medications will help you deal with pain. In general, OTC pain relievers are either acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol, etc.) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, etc.). \n Take all medications as directed. Acetaminophen should be taken every 4-6 hours, and ibuprofen every 6-8 hours. \n If you have stomach problems, kidney problems, or are pregnant, don’t take ibuprofen without consulting a doctor. \n People with liver disease should not take acetaminophen., Focus on the sensation of the air at every stage in the breathing process — how it feels as it enters through your nose, how it feels when you hold it in your chest, how it feels as it rushes back out through your nose or over your tongue. Think about those feelings, and nothing else. \n Inhale slowly and deeply so your belly, rather than your chest, rises first. \n When you can’t take in any more air, hold your breath for several seconds. \n Exhale slowly and methodically, controlling the release of air rather than letting it all rush out on its own. \n When you’ve finished exhaling, pause for a few seconds before repeating the cycle with your next inhalation. \n Repeat this process until you feel comfortable releasing your attention. \n To take your mind off the unpleasant pains, try to let your mind wander to other stimuli that engage your senses. You might listen to your favorite album, watch an engaging TV show or movie, have a conversation with someone, or perform a light activity that doesn’t stress your hand, like going for a walk. Research show that engaging your five senses makes your experience of pain more manageable., Research shows that guided imagery, in which a person or audio recording helps a person in pain focus on relaxing mental images, can help ease both chronic and acute pain.However, a recent study suggests that simply visualizing your favorite foods on your own can achieve the same effect without the external aid or guide.Just fantasize about tucking into your favorite foods — whether it’s chocolate or a cheeseburger — in intense detail, imagining how it smells, tastes, and feels. Let those pleasant thoughts take over your mind and the pain will fall away. \n The cold temperature slows down the blood flow to the area, reducing any swelling or inflammation that could make the injury worse. The extreme cold will also numb the area, reducing how much pain your experience, as mentioned above. \n If you don’t have ice, any cold object will do. A bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer is just as good as an ice pack. \n Just like with the application of cold, the goal is to decrease the blood flow to the injured area to reduce swelling. As you’re icing your injury, keep both your hand and finger up in the air. \n However, if you closed the door on the tip of the finger and didn’t injure your joints or our nail bed, the doctor may just advise that you rest your hand and wait it out. \n This discoloration indicates that blood is pooling under the nail, and you need to contact a doctor for advice on how to proceed. If it’s just a small amount of blood, the injury might heal on its own. However, large amounts of blood can be painful, and might require action. The doctor may ask you to come in so he or she can release the pressure building up under the nail, or they may direct you to relieve the pressure yourself. \n The doctor should drain the hematoma if the collection of blood is less than 24 hours old. If more than 48 hours have passed, the blood has clotted and there is no use for draining. Patients should have a neurovascular examination of the hand. Flexion and extension should be tested in all finger joints. \n However, if a professional gives you to go-ahead, you can drain the nail bed by following his or her directions. Make sure the wash your finger both before and after the procedure. \n Heat the tip of a paper clip or thumbtack over fire until it’s red-hot to sterilize it. Hold it with a pair of pliers or protective gloves to protect your hands from the heat. \n Touch the hot metal tip to the fingernail, where the blood is pooling. Even without applying too much pressure, the heat will sear a small hole into the nail. In most cases, this will be uncomfortable, but not painful. \n Allow the blood to drain out through the hole and relieve your pain. \n Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. \n In many cases, depending on the severity of the injury, you can simply ice the hand and wait for it to heal on its own. However, you should consult a doctor if you observe any of the following:Inability to bend a finger \n Injury to a joint or palm bones \n Injury to the nail bed \n A deep cut \n A broken bone \n Dirt at the site of the injury that needs to be cleared out to prevent infection \n Any sign of infection (redness, swelling, warmth, pus, fever)Failure for the injury to heal or improve \n

Select cell I30 and paste into the editing Formula Bar the formula you just copied. Do the same for cell I31. Edit cell I31's formula to read "=I24*H31+I25" and press enter and then edit cell I30's formula in the formula bar to read "=I24*H30+I25" and press enter . I30'S result should be 1.7786108729206 and I31's result should be 4.05093465957812 (which I realize is higher than a 4.0 GPA, but we're creating a regression line, so that doesn't matter so much)., Now mine comes out wrong and I have to edit the series. Not a big deal. Select the data marker and in the formula bar, edit the series to read "=SERIES(,Sheet1!$H$30:$H$31,Sheet1!$I$30:$I$31,2)" and click on the data marker at {800,1.78} and make Line red and Weight 0.75 pt, then Marker Fill Color Red, then Marker Style Round Dot size 5.\n For more art charts and graphs, you might also want to click on Category:Microsoft Excel Imagery, Category:Mathematics, Category:Spreadsheets or Category:Graphics to view many Excel worksheets and charts where Trigonometry, Geometry and Calculus have been turned into Art, or simply click on the category as appears in the upper right white portion of this page, or at the bottom left of the page. \n 
 \n If you already have the Windows 7 ISO file saved to your hard drive or a USB flash drive and know how to access the file, skip to Part Two of this article.\n You can only download the Windows 7 ISO file if you purchased Windows 7 from the Microsoft Store. \n The ISO file was made available to you at the same time you purchased Windows 7. \n For example, you will have the option to choose where you want the application installed on your hard drive. \n \n If you cannot recall where you saved the download tool, go to “Start,” and search for the application using the search field. \n Your USB flash drive must be blank, and have at least 4GB of free space. \n \n If the download tool detects any existing data on your USB flash drive, you will be prompted to erase everything before you are allowed to continue. \n Your USB flash drive is now ready to boot in Windows 7. \n The options will read as “Install now” and “Repair your computer.” \n Windows 7 will then use the files on your USB flash drive to reinstall or repair Windows 7. \n 
 Choose old eyeshadow or some from the dollar store. It's probably best to not use your good quality, expensive makeup.\n Use a fork, end of a butter knife, or similar to help you mash it up in a bowl. \n This will form the "dye" for your hair. Stir to mix well. \n You need to be somewhere that it's okay to make a mess and easy to clean up afterward. You may even wish to lay a tarpaulin sheet over the area where you're doing this. \n You may also find it helpful to be in front of a mirror. \n If the dye from the eyeshadow runs, it may stain your clothing. \n Wash your hair as usual, use shampoo and conditioner. \n Place an old towel around your neck and wear old clothes. \n It'll be a little darker the longer you leave it. \n Wear it out to a fun occasion., Use shampoo and conditioner as normal, to remove the eyeshadow colorant. Apple cider or white vinegar will definitely get it out if any is left after shampooing; just put a rinse of vinegar through to get the color off, then repeat with shampoo and conditioner to finish. \n You need to be somewhere that it's okay to make a mess and easy to clean up afterward. You may even wish to lay a tarpaulin sheet (or similar cover) over the area where you're doing this. \n You may also find it helpful to be in front of a mirror. \n If the dye from the eyeshadow runs, it may stain your clothing. \n A baby wipes or plastic food container are suitable choices. If it has a lid and you have leftovers, you can store what's left. \n As with Method 1, consider using up your old eyeshadow(s). You'll also need baby powder. \n If you are mixing colors, start with the eyeshadow you're thinking of using up completely, then add other colors as needed, gradually until the desired color is reached. \n Cut it up with a butter knife, then crush it with the rounded end of the knife. \n Do this gradually, so that you keep control over the color. \n Don't overdo this, or you will find it stiffens your hair when applied. There should be enough powder mix to cover your hair. \n Remember those old clothes! Dip the brush you're using into the mixture you've just created. Begin brushing the color into your hair, getting all of the strands you want colored. \n It will dry and stiffen on contact with the oils in your hair, so there shouldn't be any flaking off after application. \n Wash out with standard shampoo and conditioner when you're done with it. If it is a bit stubborn, use apple cider or white vinegar to get out any remaining color. \n 
 Use your regular shampoo and a deep conditioner. Starting with clean hair will make it easier to wrap your hair.\n It can also help it to stay moisturized. \n This is best for natural and very dry hair. Skip this step if your hair is already relaxed. \n If you have a thick head of hair, you should use 4 sections. If your hair is already relaxed or straightened and dry, you should use 2 sections to keep the hair more uniform. \n Use a rat tail comb to ensure the sections are parted in straight lines along the scalp. \n Be sure to remove all tangles. You want to get the hair as straight and smooth as possible prior to wrapping. \n Work each section until it is smooth and free of tangles. You can use your alligator clips to keep the sections apart. \n It should continue wrapping in a swirl pattern around the outside of your head until you reach the end. \n Make sure it stays straight in all areas. Comb the section and start the wrapping process again if it does not stay straight, smooth and detangled. \n Clip it. \n Clip it as necessary. \n Clip it as necessary. You should try to use between 4 and 6 clips. \n You can comb out the hair as you wrap it; however, it may make it harder to wrap all the sections of the hair, because the comb can disturb other sections. Combing or wrapping after combing depends upon your preference. \n Your hair should look like a “hive."It should have wide, higher sections around the entire outside of the head. Try not to pile the sections of the hair on top of each other, but have them swirl around each other. \n The satin will help to smooth the hair at night and avoid excess breakage. \n An easy way to tie a scarf is to lay the square scarf on top of your head. Pull all corners towards your forehead and tie them all into a single knot to hold them in place. \n This can help to keep the wrap intact.Place the trunk section of the pantyhose over your head. It should be tight but comfortable. Wrap the legs around to the base of the neck. Tie them in place. \n If you don’t have a hooded dryer, you can use a hand held blow dryer on medium with a dryer cap. This process will dry your hair while straightening it. \n Depending on the length of your hair, it may take several hours or more to dry completely. You should keep the wrap in place for at least 20 minutes to 1 hour after it is dry. As the hair cools, it will become smoother. \n You can keep it covered with a silk scarf until you are ready to style it. It is important to only use a silk scarf as this will prevent the hair from pulling or snagging during sleep., Keep the hair wrapped until you are ready to comb and style it as usual. Removing the hair wrap too early can cause your hair to get messed before you even start getting ready. \n Then, wait until you are no longer in the humid bathroom and remove all the layers. The hot, damp environment of a shower can cause your hair to get wet and end up frizzy. \n Comb the hair in the opposite direction that the hair was wrapped. Combing the hair back will help eliminate any annoying cowlicks that can come from wrapping hair. \n 
 Usually you will want to choose a type of tile that reflects your decorating colors, sports team or theme. Go to a hardware store to look through the various choices of glass, ceramic or stone. \n Another option is to create a tile mural with pennies. By placing pennies in a design, you can lay down a copper surface on your bar top.\n Go to the store with the measurements of your bar top, so that the staff can advise you on the quantity of tile and other supplies you will need. \n Remove your tile colors from the container and plan your design. Although you do not to use all the tiles at once, it is a good idea to set up the main images and take pictures or draw sketches, so that you stay on track once you begin to set your tile. \n Open the windows and apply the diluted product according to package directions. This strong cleaner will ensure you don't have any dirt or products that will corrode your mortar. \n Rinse the TSP thoroughly off the bar counter surface. Wear gloves and long sleeves while cleaning the bar top. \n Most thinset water is mixed with cool water. It will need to set for a while, so ensure you follow package directions well before you start to make your tile mural. \n Use the un-notched edge of the trowel to spread the first layer. Smooth it well to maintain an even surface. \n This time, use the notched edge of the trowel to spread the mortar. Create uniform grooves in the mortar across the entire surface. \n Press the tile in only slightly. You do not need to push it to the bottom of the mortar. \n Be sure to set the tiles carefully to avoid getting mortar on the front of the tile. If this happens, remove the tile and clean it, then replace it onto your mural. \n Near the edge of the bar top, use tile snips to cut ceramic or glass tiles into diagonal or smaller shapes that fit within your borders. \n You will want to ensure there isn't any errant mortar before you let it dry. \n It will need to set at least overnight. \n Follow the package directions to ensure the right ratios and timing. \n Make sure you get a good layer of grout between your tiles. \n Drag it across the top of the tiles. Allow the rest of the tile to set for 10 minutes. \n Wipe the surface of the tiles thoroughly. Rinse and squeeze the sponge if it no longer cleans the tile. \n You should remove any chalky film on the tiles with the dry towel. \n It may need to dry for up to 24 hours. \n This will help to avoid mold and mildew in your bar counter. Apply 2 coats, if your product suggests that it will create a better seal. \n Add trim to the counter top if desired. \n 
 It is better to use fresh, frozen fruit for these recipes instead of ice. The ice will only dilute the smoothie, making it less flavorful. Using frozen fruit in your smoothie will result in a smoothie that is still thick and cold, but it won't make it watery.\n Start off by laying the strawberries on their sides. Using a sharp knife, slice the tops off. Then, set them down on the sliced side. Cut them straight down, creating two half-cones. \n If the recipe calls for frozen strawberries, cut the strawberries the night before, scoop the slices into a plastic, re-sealable bag, and toss them into the freezer. \n Cut the banana into ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) thick slices. \n If the recipe calls for frozen bananas, cut the banana the night before, place the slices into a plastic, re-sealable bag, and toss them into the freezer. \n Using raw, oatmeal in your smoothie will not harm you, but cooked oatmeal will give your smoothie a more creamy texture. Cook it the night before so that it has time to cool down before you add it to the smoothie. \n You won't be pouring your milk in all at once. Instead, you will be pouring in half of your milk first, then adding the rest of your ingredients. The rest of the milk will go into the blender at the very end. This helps blend things more evenly in your smoothie., Strawberries and bananas are healthy enough themselves, but you can give your smoothie an additional boost by adding other ingredients, such as cacao powder, chia seeds, and wheat grass. Refer to the section in this article on customizing your smoothie with extra ingredients for more suggestions. \n If you do not have a blender, you can use a food processor instead. \n Save the rest of your milk for the very end. \n If the recipe you are using calls for dry ingredients, such as flax seed and oatmeal, pour them in now. If you cooked your oatmeal the night before, you can add it in at this point as well. \n If you wish to add a little protein to your smoothie, you can add in one tablespoon of peanut butter. \n If you do not like peanut butter or are allergic to it, but still want a sweet-tasting smoothie, opt for 1 tablespoon of honey instead. \n Do not worry if the fruit is not evenly-sliced. It will get all blended together. The frozen fruit will not only help thicken your smoothie, but keep it cool as well. \n Take the remaining milk, and pour it over the fruit. \n Put the lid onto the blender, and turn the blender on. Start at a low speed, then progress to a higher speed. \n If the ingredients are clumping up on the sides of the blender, they probably aren't blending properly. Simply stop the blender and open the lid. Stir the ingredients inside with a spatula, making sure to knock any clumps of fruit off the sides of the mixing container. Replace the lid and turn the blender back on. \n Once everything has blended, stop the blender, take off the lid, and pour everything into a tall glass. You can use a spatula to help guide everything into the cup. Be sure to scrape any smoothie off the sides of the mixing container so that nothing goes to waste. \n There are certain items you can add to your smoothie to make it even healthier. This section will give you are few tips and ideas. \n It is full of antioxidants, which help you stay healthy and prevent you from getting sick. It is also rich in magnesium, iron, and potassium. , Chia seeds not only help thicken up a smoothie, but they also have plenty of protein and trace minerals., If you want to water down your smoothie without sacrificing flavor, add a splash of coconut water. Not only will it give you a tropical twist, but it is also good for hydration. It also contains potassium and electrolytes., Flax seed is a fiber, which is good for digestive health and helping relieve constipation. It can also help reduce heart disease by lowering blood cholesterol., A pinch of raw, grated ginger will help ease digestive issues, such as stomachaches and heartburn. It will also help ease the pain associated with menstrual cramps., If your smoothie isn't sweet enough for you, pass the sugar and reach for the honey instead. It is just as sweet, but has the antioxidants that sugar does not! \n Add 1 to 2 cups (75 to 150 grams)of kale to your smoothie for additional health benefits. Packed with vitamins and antioxidants, kale is great for fighting off disease and boosting the immune system.It also helps prevent cancer and diabetes. (It will also turn your smoothie an exciting green color!) \n Oatmeal is good for making you feel filler with fewer calories. They also have plenty of fiber and protein. Lastly, they also have the ability to absorb excess fat. \n Baking spices, such as cardamom and cinnamon will add some extra flavor and sweetness to your smoothie, but they won't load on the calories like sugar will. \n Wheat grass is filled with amino acids, antioxidants, fiber, minerals, and vitamins. It gives you energy, boosts your immune system, and helps detoxify the body.
 You must understand your nature and what makes you different from others in both positive and not so positive ways. This will allow you to figure out the meaning of the reaction of your date or friend. \n Knowing yourself better will also get you to making up for an unsatisfactory experience.\n Wanting a boyfriend/girlfriend is fine and normal but it should be for the right reasons. If you want someone who will stand by you, cherish you, and spend their life with you, that's the right reason. However, wanting someone to showoff or impress your friends, make someone jealous, or make someone else happy, is not fair on the one who may trust you. If it's the latter, you should reconsider the motto and the other person's emotions. \n You may want someone who is: \n Sensitive towards you. \n Shares and cares about you. \n Helps you in the walks of life as much as is doable and \n Is honest about themselves and about you. \n You may find these qualities including a few more surprises. Just as you desire to be accepted, be non-judgmental about their 'flaws' and make them feel good about you. \n Don't set your standards too high that you end up passing up on someone wonderful or making the person feel insufficient. \n Don't set your standards too low, either. There are many great people out there; why end up with someone you can barely tolerate? \n Think about 'wants' versus 'needs'. Like, 'blonde hair' may be a preference but someone more endearing and patient is essential for the relationship to work in the longer run. Think about the "wants" more as bonuses to an already lovable person. For that you must appreciate who you have, what they have and what they add to your life as a couple. \n A lot of people rehearse their conversations in from of a mirror. You can try this or watch some videos as to what some conversation starters are. \n For instance you may ask them their name and what it means. Depending upon your interest the conversation could be carried forward. \n Some people are not very comfortable with those who speak too fast, loud or non-stop. You can look at their eyes and smile which when directed to you may give a hint that they are interested in what you are talking about. \n If they constantly seem to look away, you may wait a little longer to understand in your own way if they are interested in you or not. \n You could hang out at places where your ideal person would hang out. For instance, if you want someone who loves animals, volunteer at an animal shelter. If you want someone who loves to read, hang out at a bookstore or library. \n Bear in mind that typical places mean that they are there with a purpose. Hence you may either strike a very gentle conversation and leave them to themselves or continue if they show interest. Or revisit the same place so you know how to go about with it and whom to speak to. \n If you happen to form mere friendship, do not disregard them as they will sense it in your expressions or conversations. They could introduce you to someone they know who's great for you or may be worth a try. \n You may feel uncomfortable doing this; if so, keep trying with the other ways. Dating sites can bring incredible results, or they can bring awful results. Just be cautious and clear. \n You must be aware of your strengths and weaknesses as an Aspy. Hence, it will be easier for you to start and stop when you must. For instance: \n If you are concerned about your pitch then you must not converse non-stop. Give the other one a chance to speak. If they are finding you interesting and just wants to listen, do it tactfully by asking their opinion about it or their personal experience about a certain thing. When they feel that you value their opinion, they will be happier to express themselves. Mostly because they will find a mutual bond growing between you. \n If you find it difficult to maintain or show the same level of interest in a person day after day, do these that assure fondness. Like: \n Not sounding too formal once you get along. \n Willingness to share what happened throughout the day. \n Freely appreciating them of something positive they did. Remember, you may not feel comfortable at first because of Asperger's Syndrome to do all these, but you will imbibe a more patient demeanor in you as you let go of your limitations and restraints which is rooted to the emotions. \n Don't hide the topics you are truly passionate about. They may not like it as much as you but they should know that you have different or strange likes and interests. It is almost impossible to hide these from a boyfriend or a girlfriend once you start dating them. Imagine them figuring it out on their own and ending up making a mountain of a molehill. Giving a hint bravely or with an apology (depending upon your partner) is a safe choice. \n Insecurities are not a special trait of those with Asperger's Syndrome. It is a part of everyone's life. Those who have a successful partner have them because they allow the other to sense whats wrong. They allow themselves to feel normal to have insecurities. The more you hide it, the more you make it stand out and seem serious. Let fear reflect on your face and not be suppressed in your psyche or mind. That which is expressed on the face gets a getaway. That which is hidden from the face stays deep inside the mind, makes a home and multiplies. \n Make sure you don't stay too close to their body as it is a sign of desperation. And even those who are desperate may like to be with those who are not. Try glancing at them occasionally, and smile if your eyes meet. Go over (when you're sure they're not busy) and say hi. Appear pleasant but not flirty or like a Casanova. If they seem to be unbothered by your interrupting or initiating a conversation, keep going. If there is a seat, sit down. If you feel that they might mind if you sit, but your foot is aching, ask if you can sit by them, and strike up a conversation. \n More so, its natural to many and even healthy. Bear in mind that you are striking a conversation to know that person better and not to form a relation with them then and there whether you like or know them or not. Know them first, let the conversation be easy so asking for their contact number (the same day or after a few days) or Facebook id won't seem like too much too soon. Each individual is different and one thing may work differently for different people. It is all the matter of your understanding of you both and your ability to comprehend what you understand. \n If you see they have a book next to them, say "I love that book," or "that book looks interesting. How far have you read it, is it good?" If you have a class with them, make a comment about the class, like "this homework assignment is torture, depending upon their interests." \n Do they keep responses to a minimum, like "yeah," "sure," and "I guess." (Keep in mind that they may be shy too. If they smile nervously and avoid your eyes, those are good indicators.) If they look away from you, as if looking for a distraction or escape, you might be boring or creeping them out. If their body is turned away, they are not engaged in what you're saying. Don't push the subject: just say, "oh, I gotta run," or excuse yourself to answer an imaginary text. \n Love or bonding is supported on the pillars of happiness. If they find happiness in following you, they will. If they no more find any love in you, they may seek to leave. \n If they are reluctant, give them the benefit of doubt and give them a chance. Explain what you felt when they neglected you and let them sense that you may not tolerate it forever. If you show that you can't do anything about their negligence, they will continue it. If you show that you may leave, they may try to hold you back if you mean something to them. These will be the times when you will know where the relationship stands, whether it has a foundation of truth or has no feelings at all. \n There is no reason in getting the vengeance out on yourself as you not seeking any partner after a rejection would be unfair not to them but on you. Keep doing what your heart wants to do. Your heart will take care of you so long as you do not mean any damage to anybody. \n 
 When deleting Windows 7 from a multiboot environment, you'll need to make sure that your boot manager is copied and configured to boot from the remaining operating system. This is typically only necessary if Windows 7 was the first operating system installed on the computer. \n This is a boot manager configuration tool that will allow you to adjust your boot manager while deleting Windows 7. You can download the Non-commercial version for free from neosmart.net/EasyBCD/#comparison. \n You can also press the Windows key + R. \n This will open the Disk Management window. \n You can expand the Status column if you can't see enough. The volume with the "System" status is the volume that contains the boot manager. If your Windows 7 volume is the one marked "System", read on to the next step. If the volume for your other operating system is marked "System", skip down to Step 10 \n Now that the boot manager has been copied, you can safely start the deletion process. \n You will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the volume. \n Select "Extend Volume" and add the newly created free space to it. \n You'll now need to reconfigure your boot manager so that it boots properly into your remaining operating system. \n Your system will now boot properly to your remaining operating system.Repeat this for any additional operating systems you still have installed. \n 
 Foreshadowing all of this, he has an Invisibility Watch to cloak him completely, rendering him impossible to see (Secondary Fire) and a Disguise Case, useful to fooling the opposing team (Four key).\n \n One of the major improvements for Spies in TF2 is the effect of movement speed on the Spy, depending on your current disguise. For example, you will slow down to a Heavy's movement speed while disguised as a Heavy. \n Keep in mind that you will not speed up to a Scout's or Medic's speed (although the Medic's speed is not much different from your speed.) \n Make sure that your disguise makes some sense. You probably wouldn't find a Scout running down to your own intelligence room, just as you wouldn't find a Pyro defending in the water, or a Sniper charging the front lines. The general idea here is that you want to blend in with the other team as much as possible, so don't do things that they wouldn't do otherwise. Also try not to disguise as an enemy Spy because most enemies go crazy when they see a Spy, theirs or the enemy's, and instantly attack them. Also, try to stay away from your team mates; when the enemy sees you close to your team mates without you shooting at them or vice versa, they will get suspicious. \n Remember that enemy Medics can heal you when you are disguised. Your health will match that of the person you're disguising as, so you will often appear to need a heal. Calling for a Medic while disguised can often give you an excuse to retreat into the enemy base, which is particularly useful with the Dead Ringer. \n Enemy Engineer dispensers will also heal you while disguised. Level 3 dispensers restore cloak in both the Invisibility Watch and Dead Ringer more quickly than cloak is used, so you can stay invisible near a Level 3 dispenser indefinitely. \n Back in Team Fortress Classic (TFC), a disguised Spy would resemble an enemy player to your teammates, which proved to be very confusing: When disguised in TF2, you will resemble a Spy wearing a "cardboard-cutout mask" of your chosen class, to your teammates. This will help to distinguish you from an actual enemy player. \n Before the Sniper vs. Spy update, the enemy Spy disguise was useless, as it didn't wear a disguise mask. Disguising as a friendly player was the preferred way to approach the front lines. Now, with the update, you will disguise as a disguised Spy, making an enemy Spy disguise much more effective. \n While you're cloaked, you aren't helping your team. \n Hide somewhere different every time, don't always camp the same place. When you are disguised and an enemy becomes suspicious and starts shooting you, the best thing to do would be to cloak and hide. This is because the Spy's revolver and knife will not do a remarkable amount of damage in direct combat. When safe, disguise as a different class and return to enemy lines. \n It's very useful, yes, but it doesn't make you invincible. Keep these tips in mind when using the cloak. \n You will be partially revealed if you take damage using the cloak and dagger or the vanilla watch. As such, don't run into oncoming fire while cloaked, such as toward a Heavy's minigun. The Dead Ringer will not shimmer when you take damage, and damage will be greatly reduced. \n When you uncloak, you will glow your team's color. That is, if you are on the RED team, you will glow red before fading back into visibility. This happens regardless of whether you are disguised as a red or a blue player, so this will quickly give you away if you are seen removing your cloak. \n Note that you cannot use any of your weapons or reload your revolver when cloaked or uncloaking. You will need to wait a few seconds to uncloak before being able to attack again. \n Remember that you can still bump into enemies while cloaked. This makes running around corners tricky, as you'll probably end up bumping into a player by accident. If you bump into an enemy with the C&D or vanilla watch, your cloak will flicker and briefly reveal you, which has the potential to blow your cover completely. You will still block and be blocked by enemies with the Dead Ringer, but you will not flicker. \n Keep in mind that you will only bump into enemies. You can easily pass through your teammates. \n Uncloaking right behind enemy players is generally a bad idea. Becoming visible takes about two seconds, and in that time someone can easily see you. Furthermore, uncloaking makes a distinct sound, especially with the Dead Ringer, which an aware enemy will notice. \n Use the Cloak and Dagger for infiltration. The cloak and dagger allows you to regenerate your cloak while you are cloaked and standing still. If you are moving, the cloak will be reduced more quickly than your normal cloak, but when you run out you stay partially cloaked. This makes it much easier to hide in an enemy base and disguise yourself without any trouble. The cloak and dagger makes cloaking a much more powerful weapon because you no longer need to be visible at any point in time during the round. Just be careful that when recharging you stand in a place that you won't get bumped into. \n If you run while you're out of cloak, you will glow your team's color as if you were bumped or uncloaking. However, crouch-walking will allow you to remain fully invisible. \n Use The Dead Ringer when under enemy fire. The Dead Ringer cloaks you when you are dealt damage and shows a death animation to your killer. As such, it is most effective when your team is charging the front line, or you're getting Spy-checked. Even after the fact, you may not be revealed to have the Dead Ringer if you have another Spy on your team. Try not to use it too much though, or you may find yourself still getting Spy-checked after you cloak. Just be warned, when you have the Dead Ringer out and you're not cloaked, it acts as if you are cloaked, so you cannot fire your weapon. \n Find a safe place to uncloak with the Dead Ringer. The Dead Ringer makes a loud crackling sound upon uncloaking, which will instantly reveal you as a Dead Ringer spy. Find a place far away from enemies to uncloak. \n Be particularly careful of Pyros. The Dead Ringer can extinguish flames, but if you use it while under fire from the flamethrower, you will be lit up again. \n If you are spotted by a Pyro, it may be in your best interest to cloak and get some cover. Be sure to stay out of the range of his flamethrower. \n When disguised, try to sneak up on an unsuspecting player and stab them in the back. \n Always attack the farthest player in a group. If you manage to sneak behind a group of five players, start from the back and slowly start backstabbing forward, making sure that no one spots you in doing so. This works well when playing a Payload game since all of your enemies should be focused on pushing the payload and killing enemies ahead of it. \n Avoid using the knife as a melee weapon. TF2 has made melee weapons pack a greater punch than the old knife/crowbar from TFC. The knife is excellent at backstabbing, but it comes at a cost. It is the weakest melee weapon in the game when not backstabbing, on par with the Scout's bat, but much slower, and does not deal critical damage. It is generally a good idea to switch to your revolver if you have given up on backstabbing your target. The Spy is not suited to close quarters combat. If you are discovered, cloak, get out of the area, and try again. \n The Sniper class can unlock a secondary item named the Razorback. a wooden shield attached to their back, which makes them immune to one backstab, and a Spy breaking it with his knife will become unable to attack for a few seconds. If you bump into a Razorback-wielding enemy Sniper, simply shoot him in the head instead of using your knife. \n Get behind enemy lines and observe the other team. Do you see well-positioned sentries or teleporters? Does their Heavy wreak havoc to your team, and is he being healed by a Medic about to Ubercharge him? You constantly have to make the decision as to which target you attack first. \n \n Since sappers disable sentry guns. It can help to shoot a sapped sentry with your revolver or stab it with your knife a few times to help destroy it quickly. It will not shoot at you so long as the sapper stays in place. Be careful when doing this with an Engineer attempting to repair it, as you may get killed in doing so. \n With your sapper out and trained on your target object, a white outline of the sapper is displayed on the object. Bear in mind that this is visible not only to you, but to everyone present. Place your sapper and put it away quickly to avoid attention. \n Don't forget that using a sapper will not remove your disguise. \n Like for the other 'weapons', you will need to remove your cloak in order to be able to activate your sapper. \n Enemy sentries are usually target priority, because they tend to cause a lot of destruction on your team. \n Don't sap a dispenser immediately. Sap the sentry in an engineer camp and then let the dispenser refuel your ammo and health supplies. Then, when ready, sap the dispenser. \n \n If you are close to your team, or there are not a lot of enemies covering the route to your team, you can just walk backwards while shooting your revolver to safety. \n If you are not on fire, you can attempt to fool your pursuers by running in one direction, cloaking (it doesn't matter if you take a few hits) then running back in the other direction. It is also smart to take on another disguise while cloaked. Usually your pursuers will keep running in the first direction and checking everywhere for the cloaked Spy. This also leaves their backs wide open for a backstab if you are bold enough. \n If you are near an Engineer and his buildings, do not simply sap everything. Typically, an Engineer would have no trouble removing all of these sappers and you will have lost time you could have spent killing the Engineer. It is best to sap a sentry first, kill the Engineer and proceed to sap the rest of his buildings. In rare cases the Engineer can be stabbed first, but the sentry must be sapped quickly after. \n Remember though that the revolver loses much of its power over medium to long range but critical shots don't. \n The Ambassador is the more effective pistol over long range, due to the initial shot being perfectly accurate, and able to deal 100% crit damage for headshots; this strength is balanced against poorer body-shot damage and a slower fire rate. Choose your pistol according to your play style and map design. \n \n A spy can let the opposing team "accidentally" discover him and lead them away from a battle or into a trap. A quick cloak and the enemy has been led on a wild goose chase. This won't work on all classes like Pyros or Scouts though, so be careful. \n Conversely, enemies in combat don't have opportunities to check their backs. It is often easier to kill enemies in the middle of a fight than to kill them on their way to one. \n Sapping teleporter entrances near the enemy's spawn will slow down their advances and sometimes distract Engineers into leaving their buildings to run back to spawn to build them up. \n \n With the Dec. 10, '08 patch, a spy can now recharge their cloak with ammo boxes and dropped weapons. Use this to your advantage in enemy territory and strip enemy Engineers of respawning ammo boxes. This will not only slow down their construction but hopefully lead them further away from their buildings and teammates to find more metal. You can take this opportunity to sap or stab accordingly. \n Also with this update a Spy can stay cloaked next to an enemy dispenser and drain its metal slowly. \n Similarly to ammo boxes, stealing health packs in enemy territory can hamper them. This means less health for the enemy team and can lead to people dying sooner, Medics burning to death, etc. \n \n Sentry guns cannot shoot through their own team's dispensers. If an Engineer is positioned in a way that won't allow a Spy to stab and sap quickly, consider stabbing the Engineer, hiding behind his dispenser, disguise, then sap the gun. This is risky as the enemy can see you without a disguise, or their gun can kill you, but this is still an option. \n Sentry guns also spin to target players faster with lower levels. If you backstab an Engineer while he is behind his gun, you can sap lower level sentry guns easier without being shot because they spin to shoot you slower. Level 3 sentry guns are harder to sap in this case because they spin very fast and will push you back with a barrage of their bullets. A Spy can still sap a Level 3 sentry gun, but it must be done with proper positioning and fast weapon switching. Make sure you enable fast weapon switch in the game options to do this, or alternatively use the 'last weapon' button (default: Q) to instantly switch to the last weapon you were holding. You should briefly switch to your sapper before engaging the sentry in order for the 'last weapon' button technique to work. \n \n The Spy Update has given the spy more options for tackling sentries. Due to the greater accuracy and firepower of the Ambassador over a long distance when aiming at an enemy's head, the weapon can effectively disable a turtling engineer outside of a sentry's range of fire, or from behind cover. \n You can do a similar strategy with this using walls, boxes, posts, ramps, etc. Out of sight of the sentry gun generally means safety. \n Players tend to take the shortest routes and generally don't stray from this path, especially if their destination is far away. \n For example, players will take the inside corner of a hallway. As a spy you can travel or hide on the outside corners of these hallways and see enemy traffic and pick your targets accordingly. \n Hiding on boxes, on top of objects on the wall, etc. makes it much less likely to be bumped into while cloaked or shown with enemy fire, explosions, etc. \n Hide behind boxes, walls, around corners or places with respawning ammo boxes to keep your cloak up. Players don't usually check all corners so you can be relatively safe if you weren't spotted or suspected of being there. \n This watch can be used to run the length of the 2fort bridge, without stopping. The cloak and dagger allows you to cloak for an infinite amount of time as the cloak with regenerate while stationary. The Dead Ringer does not allow you to cloak until you get hit with it selected (MOUSE2), thus creating a fake "corpse" and cloaking you for a limited time. When the timer runs out or you uncloak, the watch will emit a loud noise, possibly alerting people near by. \n 
\n Just buy the product and leave. \n If you do not treat the employee with respect they will not treat you with respect and you will not receive a high level of service, in fact the employee may be so annoyed with people like you that he/she will go out of their way to "rip-you-off" and cause you problems in the future with your returns and shopping experience. \n To retail employees, the "Squeaky Wheel" gets "the Shaft" \n Constantly return items for no valid reason? To businesses you just cost them money and they don't want you as a customer and will help you as little as possible, if at all. \n Refuse to listen to reason or be shown the facts rather than believe what you have "heard"? This shows the employee(s) that you are ignorant and their want to help you will drastically decrease. \n Try to "get a deal" or "get the hook-up" whenever you come to shop at the business? The business and its employees will recognize you as a customer who does not spend money on products that makes the business money so why the business want you as a customer? \n Claim to have spent "thousands of dollars" with this place of business? Because odds are, the employee/manager can look up your purchase history and can tell you are lying. This will result in you getting "The Shaft" \n Lie while talking to the employee(s)/manager(s)? Odds are you will get someone who catches you in a lie and this will result in you getting "The Shaft". \n Refuse to accept the store's policies even when they are displayed clearly throughout the store and are printed on the receipt? If so you will be considered ignorant and this will result in you getting "The Shaft" \n Say something to the effect of "Your employee told me." and you can't tell them who the employee was, what they looked like, or when it even happened? This will destroy your validity and the employee will not trust you. \n Speak loudly, yell, raise your voice, or make any threats including "I'll just take my business somewhere else" or "This happens every time I come here." They don't give a damn what you want at this point and may even refuse service. \n
 \n \n Advanced users can usually find their own shades. \n This will keep the colors in place all day and prevent creasing. Urban Decay primer potion is recommended. \n To maintain the conventional look, refrain from applying any eye make-up beyond the span of your eyebrows. \n). \n Apply the second color from the middle of your pupil outwards (remembering not to go beyond your eyebrow). This color goes on your lid. Blend it upwards into your crease. Follow the natural shadows of your eyes. \n Apply it to the outside corner of the eye. Blend the color into the crease and slightly into both the upper and lower eyelash lines. Don't go further in with this color than the outside edge of your iris (the colored part of your eyeball). \n Start the eyeliner where you started shade #2 (right above the pupil). \n NYC loose powder is excellent for this step. \n Apply mascara starting from the outside corner of the eye and work inwards. \n Remember that most people won't be looking at you as closely as you look at yourself in the mirror. \n Use eye make-up remover, or in a pinch, you can also use Vaseline or baby oil. Rinse it off, so that it won't clog your pores. Follow with a face wash specifically formulated to remove make-up, but avoid using it around your eyes. \n
 Look around at your world, and try to determine what kind of biome you are in. They can be forests, deserts, oceans, taigas, jungles, etc. If there are trees, iron, water, clay and coal, you're off to a great start!\n This may sound strange, but it is one of the only things you can do at the moment. You will need wood for the rest of the game to make pickaxes to mine later on. You can make loads of items with them! Try to collect about 10-20 wood blocks. \n You should now proceed to drag the logs into the 'Crafting' section of your inventory. On the output side, you should have wood planks. Collect at least four. \n This will make a crafting table. You can use it to make many things in the Minecraft game, including chests, beds, furnaces, weapons, and more important stuff like that! \n Put one wooden plank on the bottom, and one on the top. You should see four sticks in the output. Collect them to make torches and handles of weapons. \n You should look in the sources for the Minecraft Wiki. Look up Wooden Pickaxe, Wooden Axe, Wooden Sword, and Wooden Shovel on the wiki. \n Take your shovel and dig through the dirt, then take your pickaxe to carve a small room out of the stone. \n Again, use the wiki to learn how to make them. \n Do NOT dig straight down! Use a stair-like fashion where you can climb up and down the ledges. Mine until you find coal! If you find coal within 4 minutes, skip to step 11. Also, if you find a cave, remember where it is, but avoid it, they are far too dangerous for you to explore at the moment. \n If so, skip to step 11. If you did not find any coal. It's okay, just go to the surface and find some logs. Make a furnace (use the wiki) and put it down. Put your logs in the top part of the furnace, and some wooden planks in the bottom. The outcome will be charcoal, a carbon copy of coal (no pun intended). \n Put the stick in one of the bottom squares of the crafting table, and the coal/charcoal above it. The output should be 4 torches. \n If you need more light, repeat step 11 until you have reached your desired amount. \n By now it should be night-time. It is essential that you make a door. Make your doorway 1x2 so the door fits perfectly. You will probably start off with wooden doors. When you get slightly advanced later in the game, replace with iron doors for better security. \n In this time you should make a chest (look on the wiki, last time it will be said). \n This is probably the most dangerous time that you have experienced in Minecraft so far, so be prepared. Don't bring anything except your sword and be alert for monsters. \n Now is your time to be relaxed and have fun. Kill everything that moves except yourself, and get great rewards by doing so. \n You may have to kill animals, but if you're too nice to slaughter them, find some apples by punching more trees, or harvest some wheat with a hoe. Wheat seeds are obtainable through grass, which should be abundant in your Minecraft world. Mine with your pickaxe to find some iron and coal. With iron, you can craft shears to shear sheep so you don't need to kill them. You need 3 wool blocks to make a bed. The easy way out is to kill sheep, but if you keep them alive you can continue shearing them and eventually breed them. \n Put it somewhere in your house that looks good; it is recommended you expand your house! With a bed, you can save your spawn point, so if you die, you will respawn in your house. Continue to kill until the sun sets. \n When the sun sets, grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again, for the monsters are coming out. Go into your mine and continue mining, since iron ore will be very valuable to you. Look for iron, coal and rare ores for about 7 minutes, because that is when the sun will start to rise. Always be alert for monsters, especially creepers, which will explode if they come too close. \n If that is the case, then keep looking., At sunrise, kill all mobs again, since you will need all of the items that they drop when killed. See all of the crafting recipes you can make with these drops at the Minecraft Wiki. \n Make a basic checklist of things you might want to find. Some suggestions are: Sand, Clay, Ink Sacs, Cactus, Birch Tree, Spruce Tree, Oak Tree, and Mountain Biome. Mountain biomes are VERY useful for mining and finding/making unique structures. \n Smelt sand in the furnace to create glass, put cacti on sand around your house to make a monster barrier, put cacti in the furnace to make green dye, use ink sacs as black dye, decorate with different kinds of wood! Really, there are infinite possibilities! \n You have iron tools, but still live in a cave. Now that you are more experienced, consider building an outside portion to your cave or even move and build an entirely new house! You can make windows if you have glass. \n Grab a stone or iron sword and of course, a pickaxe, and set off down into the cave. Be sure to bring LOTS of torches! You will find lots of coal and iron as well as gold and redstone if you go deeper down. If you're lucky you might even find diamonds, but be careful as there is often lava flowing underground. Don't bring items that are unnecessary, as your inventory will be filled to the brim after your mining trip! \n If you explored the cave, you are sure to have found plenty of iron! Smelt it, and use the wiki to figure out how to make it into armor. Of course, before you use good iron on armor, be sure to make backups for your tools. \n If you dig down to layer 11 by using F3 (please remember not to dig straight down), you will have the highest chance of finding diamond. You can make a strip mine there for a high chance to find diamond. A strip mine is usually one wide and two tall, and is the most effective way of getting diamonds. It is suggested you use a diamond pickaxe to mine it, but an iron one will also work. \n Diamonds have many of the same uses as iron, but they don't need to be smelted, are far more powerful, much more durable, and have extra purposes. Diamonds are usually favored by Minecraft players as a great achievement. \n Find a lava pool towards the bottom of the world, but be sure not to fall in! Lava deals deadly damage. If you have made a bucket with iron, you can scoop up some water from the surface and bring it to the lava pool. Right click on a wall in the room (not the lava itself), and watch the magic happen. All of the lava will transform into obsidian! Only a diamond pickaxe can mine obsidian. \n This is a very useful resource due to it being the strongest naturally placeable block in the game. You can also make a nether portal, but you will need a flint and steel. The Nether is the 'Hell' of Minecraft, a lava-filled, glowing red and dim place. To get there, you need to make 4 obsidian blocks parallel to each other on the ground. On the outer 2 blocks, place 4 more blocks on them. Then connect it at the top. You should now have a 4x5 rectangle with a hollow 2x3 inside, all 1 block thick. You can now use a flint and steel on the inside and enter the nether! \n In the Nether, it is a completely different world. Almost all of the blocks are different. You will find lots of valuable resources such as glowstone and nether wart, fight dangerous mobs and maybe even find a Nether Fortress (a generated structure). There is so much in the Nether that is unique, you will just have to see for yourself! Have fun playing! \n 
 Do not use products that contain sulfates (natural oil-stripping detergents), silicone, alcohols or glycerol (hair drying and damaging chemicals) - this eliminates about 96% of available African hair care products quite apart from the poisons manufactured within Africa.\n They all severely stress your hair. \n Heat removes moisture and can fry your hair irreparably. It is preferably better to leave hair to dry naturally, rather than blowing heat. \n Shampoo washes away oil which protects your hair. When shampooing, apply it only to the scalp, and lather very gently. After washing hair, just gently squeeze it with a towel. No pulling or roughness. \n African hair needs moisture and deep conditioning, especially when exposed to heat appliances like blow dryers and flat irons. A conditioner is a cream that is applied to the hair to smooth the cuticle, soften the hair, add sheen, and restore moisture. Oils like jojoba oil can help as well. Moisturize everything but the scalp. \n Don't plop it all on top of your head. Rinse and repeat. \n Don't pull out any hair. As you comb, apply conditioner through your hair and massage the scalp (Affirm, Matrix or Motions are suggested). Put a plastic shower cap over your head so ALL of your hair is in it. Leave it on for about 30 minutes and rinse your hair out. Comb it out as you rinse ( using slightly cooler than lukewarm water adds natural shine to the hair). \n Conditioner washing is washing your hair with a lightweight moisturizing conditioner, eliminating the shampoo step which can be very drying, especially to chemically damaged hair. Many with damaged relaxed hair wash daily. \n Apply more to the ends if they are dry. Avoid applying conditioner to the scalp unless it is dry. Rinse out conditioner very well. \n Then comb out your hair (this involves a lot of combing and brushing) and work in a heat protection product. Blow dry it on WARM setting - the hot setting will dry out and damage your hair. As you dry, work in a smoothing serum. Paul Mitchell works - and brush it downwards (root to tip) with a circular brush. When you are done, separate it into four large sections (right front, left front, right back, left back and bangs if you have then). \n Repeat the above process once every week (or two). Get a trim every 3-4 months. \n 
 The Game of Life comes with many cardboard parts that you will need to punch out and attach to the board. It also comes with some plastic pieces that you will need to attach to the board in the correct places., Your Game of Life set should have stickers for the mountain and bridge pieces. Put these stickers on the mountain and bridge pieces before you attach them to the game board., Before you start playing, you will need to assemble the board. Attach the buildings, mountains, and bridges to the correct places on the board. Each plastic piece has a letter on it that matches up with a letter on the board.Match the letter piece with the correct letter on the board. For example, the “J” piece should go into the “J” slot. \n The Game of Life uses a spinner instead of dice. You will need to put this spinner together and attach it to the board before you play your first game. Punch out the cardboard spinner and match the notches up with the notches on the plastic spinner dial. Then, snap the two pieces together.Next attach the spinner dial to the spinner base. The spinner base should have a letter on it that corresponds to the letter on the board. Snap the assembled spinner into place on the board. \n Make sure that they are all facing down. Mix them up and leave them next to the board to act as the draw pile. Take four tiles without looking at them and place them on the Millionaire Estates space., The four types of cards are Career Cards, Salary Cards, House Deeds, and Stocks. Make sure that you keep each type of card separate and then shuffle each stack. Place the stacks face-down somewhere next to the board where everyone can reach them., Place these items somewhere near the board. Players will purchase and borrow these items throughout the game, so you will want to have them somewhere that is easy to access. Select a spot right next to the game board to keep these items for when they are needed., The Banker is in charge of all money going into and out of the bank. Make sure the person who decides to be the Banker is aware that he/she will need to collect and distribute money throughout the game. The Banker will need to distribute $10,000 in Life money to each player., The Game of Life comes with six car movers in different colors as well as people pegs that go in the cars. Make sure that every player chooses a car and puts a peg into it before placing that peg on the board., Before your first turn, you will need to decide if you want to start the game with a career card or start the game by going to college. There are advantages and disadvantages to both options.The advantages of starting your career right away is that you will start earning PAY DAY money sooner and you will not have any debt. The disadvantages of starting your career right away is that you will not earn as much money and there are some career cards that you may not take. \n The advantage of going to college is that you will earn more when you do get a career card. The disadvantage of going to college is that you will have $40,000 in debt and it will take you longer to get your career card. \n If you choose to start a career, then you will need to choose a career card right away. Discard any career cards that indicate that a college degree is required, such as the doctor career card., If you are going to start college, then you will need to place your car on the start college space. You may not draw a career card yet. You may draw a career card when you reach the Job Search space., Each play will need to spin the wheel at the beginning of every turn. The number that you spin will indicate how many spaces you may move your car on the board. You may only move your car forward, not backwards on the board., The Game of Life board is very colorful and each space has different instructions that you will need to read and follow. Take some time to review the basic instructions for the space colors so that you will know what your options are.Orange spaces have instructions written on them that you must follow. \n Blue spaces have instructions on them that you may decide to follow or not follow. \n Green spaces are PAY DAY spaces. Collect the amount shown on your PAY DAY card whenever you pass or land on a green space. \n Red spaces require you to stop moving, even if you have enough moves left to go past a red space. You have to stop whenever you encounter a red space. Follow the instructions on the space, then spin and move again. \n The career spaces on the board match the available career cards. If one of your opponents owns the card, then you need to pay that opponent the amount shown on the card.If you own the career card, then you do not have to pay anything. \n If no one owns the career card, then you need to pay the amount indicated on the space to the bank. \n This rule is known as the Special Police Officer Rule. If someone spins a 10, then that person is said to have been “speeding” and must pay whoever has the Police Officer career card $5,000. If no one has the card, then no one has to pay., The accountant gets an extra space on the board which is called the Taxes space. If you land on this space, then you need to pay $5,000 to whoever has the accountant career card.If no one has this card, then pay $5,000 to the bank. \n If you have the card, then you pay nothing. \n You may choose to purchase an insurance policy at the beginning of one of your turns. These policies will offer some protection for your home or car (depending on which one you buy) in case of an accident.Auto insurance costs $10,000, but the homeowner’s insurance policies depend on the home that you own. You can find the cost of a homeowner’s insurance policy on your deed card. \n You may buy a stock card at the beginning of one of your turns. A stock card costs $50,000, but if someone spins and lands on the number on your card, then you collect $10,000 from the bank. This rule applies whether you are spinning or someone else is spinning.You may only buy one stock card, but you may get another stock card if you land on the Stock Market Zooms space. \n If you are running low on cash, then you may take out a bank loan of $20,000 at the beginning of one of your turns. Keep in mind that you will have to repay this amount to the bank when you retire plus an extra $5,000 in interest., When you have reached the Retire space, you may not spin the wheel any more or draw cards, or purchase things. This space indicates that you are near the end of the game. However, getting to the Retire space first does not mean you have won the game., The first thing you will need to do when you hit the Retire space is to repay any loans you have taken out plus the interest that you owe. Put this money back into the bank., Next, get rid of all of your special cards, but you may keep your stocks. If you are ahead of your opponents, then you can continue to collect money from your stocks when your opponents spin the wheel., Move to Millionaire Estates if you think that you have the most money. Keep in mind that if you do move to Millionaire Estates, you stand a chance to collect four additional Life tiles that may help you win the game. But other players may draw from this pile if the draw deck is empty.If you move to Countryside Acres, collect one Life tile. No one may take this Life tile from you and you may include it in your cash total at the end of the game. \n The player with the most money gets the last four life tiles that are on the Millionaire Estates space. Then, all of the players (including those at Countryside Acres) should add the cash amounts on their Life tiles with the money they have on hand. The player with the most money is the winner!
 Make sure that your navigation is stress-free and everything functions consistently. You may also want to add a search box if you don't already have one. This saves your visitors a lot of time and doesn't take long to implement.\n This includes places such as at the top of your web pages, in your sidebars, or at the bottom of your web pages. \n For example, if your web pages feature products that your visitors can purchase, place the "checkout" link at the top of your web page so the link is displayed clearly to your visitors. \n This will help encourage your visitors to spend time on your website; whereas if the colors of your background and text is too difficult to read, your visitors will most likely leave your website. \n Use color combinations that are easy to read and view, such as black or blue text on a white background, as opposed to using bright or neon colors in your background or text. \n This will help keep your readers engaged in your content and will maintain browser compatibility, as some browsers may not support fonts that are less common. \n Use common font types such as Arial, Courier New, Georgia, Times New Roman, and Verdana as opposed to fonts such as Comic Sans, Papyrus, and fonts displayed in cursive. \n Text that is separated into short paragraphs or made into bullets is more aesthetically pleasing to your visitors; as opposed to long paragraphs in a block-style format. \n Publish text that makes up paragraphs that are comprised of no more than 3 or 4 sentences. \n Minimize the number of images you use, and use images that contain simple designs and minimal colors. If your web pages contain multiple animations or Adobe Flash effects, the pages will take a longer time to load. \n Don't use too much Flash or large images that take too long to load. \n Web servers can send the website files in a ‘compressed’ way that speeds up the page loading time, yet this doesn’t require any extra work from you besides turning it on. See the server’s (usually Apache’s) website documentation for more info. \n This will help you verify that your web pages load within 15 seconds. These tools usually also provide great advice on optimizing the website. You can find a variety of tools on the Internet by using keywords in the search engine such as "web page loading tool" or "check load speed of website." \n Make sure your titles are brief, relevant to page content, and include your keywords. Label your internal links and images with relevant titles and subtle keywords. Tag your headers appropriately and include keywords in your H1 tags. \n Remember not to optimize your website in an unappealing manner. A clever webmaster can optimize without the reader recognizing the signs. This would mean using keywords sparingly and in the most effective areas. \n Since incoming links are the most important factor in SEO performance, it’s really important that other websites want to link to your website. To make this appealing for them, you should consistently publish new, valuable information for other websites to link to. \n Display the tagline for your business or website at the top of the web page, as well as prominent links for purchasing products or services. \n As a 'bonus', if your visitors are engaged or interested in the information they see when they first land on your web page, they will most likely scroll down to see additional content and continue to navigate through each web page. \n An accurate headline that describes the topic or content of the web page will help intrigue and interest your visitors. For example, if your website contains a page with sale or clearance items, use a bold headline such as "Clearance Items." \n Include interesting images that break up the content, but don't inundate the visitor with them either. Web pages should be limited because you don't want to overwhelm your visitors. Avoid using too many frames, colors, font, and font sizes. \n The content should increase traffic while meeting the needs of your visitors. Content needs to be brief, but rich in information. Web pages are harder to read than paper pages, so don't overwhelm your readers with excessive content on one page. If you do have a lot to say about a subject, spread it out onto more than 1 page and break the sections up into 2 - 3 line paragraphs. Keep your pages clean and crisp. \n Examples of typical actions include allowing the visitors to: \n Request another source of information \n Sign up for a newsletter \n Check out a related product - then to buy it, or place an order \n Contact you \n Sometimes the visitor should simply do something after visiting the website, such as going into one of the stores, or filling in a form. Make sure to provide information to make this easy to do. \n If the website is for a business, wherever you’ve provided information to the visitor and you’re not sure what action they’ll want to take after reading it, you should simply provide a link to your contact page. \n This will help you verify that they display correctly; use browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, and more. Most browsers will recognize web pages that contain standard HTML and CSS code, however some (modern) code may not be recognizable by some browsers, which may cause your content to display inaccurately or appear unattractive. Explore the topics of "graceful degradation" and "progressive enhancement" for these situations. \n CSS media queries help you provide different styles for different devices or situations; make sure your website layout shows all the website content effectively for all 'media'. \n These web tools can be found be entering keywords into a search engine such as "browser compatibility test." \n 
 Make sure you also get an amplifier, a tuner and a lead.\n Once you have hold of the basics, find some good riffs to play, it is extremely important to start playing exciting songs straight away, you need to keep yourself interested by playing songs which you enjoy, otherwise you will give up. Here's a few good starters: \n Smoke on the Water - Deep Purple \n |-----------------|---------------|----------------|------------------ \n |o----------------|---------------|----------------|------------------ \n |--0---3---5----0-|---3---6-5-----|-0---3---5----3-|---0----(0)------- \n |--0---3---5----0-|---3---6-5-----|-0---3---5----3-|---0----(0)------- \n |o----------------|---------------|----------------|------------------ \n |-----------------|---------------|----------------|------------------ \n Brain Stew - Green Day \n |------------------------|--------------------------------| \n |------------------------|--------------------------------| \n |------------------------|--------------------------------| \n |-7-7--5-5--4-4--3-3-2-2-|-7-7--5-5--4-4--3-3-3-3-2-2-2-2-| \n |-7-7--5-5--4-4--3-3-2-2-|-7-7--5-5--4-4--3-3-3-3-2-2-2-2-| \n |-5-5--3-3--2-2--1-1-0-0-|-5-5--3-3--2-2--1-1-1-1-0-0-0-0-| \n There's plenty of good easy riffs out there, you just need to find them \n Maybe try some finger tapping, once you've learnt how to finger tap, you will be able to drop peoples jaws, especially if you can master the tapping in eruption - Van Halen. If you are really good maybe try some sweep picking. \n
\n Restart your computer. \n The Disk Utility will start. On the top of left side of Disk Utility you will see your Mac's disk. \n On the right side there will appear five tabs: 'First Aid', 'Erase', 'Partition', 'RAID', 'Restore'. Select the 'Partition' tab. \n It shows how many volumes your Mac's disk have. Normally, all Macs have just one volume and that is very big problem for the end user! Here's why: if your Mac crashes, it can happen that you will not be able to restore your private data (never forget Murphy's Law). It happens not so often compared with Windows, but when it happens you may lose your data forever: email settings, pictures, Garageband songs, iWork documents, iChat and calendar history, and so on. To avoid your data loss, it is recommended that you make two partitions on your Mac: one for OSX system, the other one for your private data. \n On that "Volume Scheme' select two partitions. Mac will divide the disk to two volumes, both of equal size. \n Move the slider up between the partitions. Leave 80 Gb of the disk capacity for the system and the rest for your files. \n \n On 'Volume Information' name your system disk like Mac, or Quark. \n Name your volume like "My safe box", "Data wardrobe", whatever you wish. \n Are you sure you backed up your data? If 100% YES, then... click "Apply" button. The Disk Utility will ask something like "if you will proceed you will lose all your data", click OK. You will lose your data for sure. \n When it ends, on the left side of the Disk Utility you will see now two empty new volumes: the upper one is for system, the lower one for your data. \n
 Do not unhook your tow vehicle yet. When selecting the location, consider things like: \n Slope of the ground (you can only adjust level so much) \n Location of trees (don't want to hit roof when raised or beds when pulled out) \n Proximity to the fire pit (give yourself enough room) \n Location of electrical hookup if using one (make sure your cord is long enough)\n \n If it is already level you can skip to blocking the wheels. \n Note which side is low. This will be the wheel you will need to level up. \n This can be difficult to gage at first so it may be helpful to have a spotter watching on the outside until you get the hang of it.\n Stack more than one piece of wood if the site is particularly unlevel. \n There are commercial leveling blocks available but plywood works just fine and is probably cheaper. \n If it is still unlevel repeat the step where you move the camper and then add more plywood. It is good to have a supply of at least three to five pieces of plywood to stack if the spot is particularly unlevel. \n These can be just cut up pieces of two by four. The purpose is to keep the camper from moving when you unhook your tow vehicle as well as while you are camping. Once again, there are commercial blocks available but wood blocks work just fine. \n \n The tongue jack is at the front end of the camper next to the propane tanks and battery. \n The retaining pin is located at the midway point on the tongue jack. \n Make sure the tongue jack is retracted enough to enable it to swing to the full down position. \n Place a piece of wood underneath the jack wheel if you are camping on sandy or other soft ground to keep it from just sinking into the sand. \n \n The campsite electrical hookup is usually a three foot tall post typically near the back of the campsite. \n It is safer to plug your campers electrical cord in with the breaker at the hookup off. \n This is especially important if you have food already in the fridge. \n Most camper refrigerators will operate on 12V DC battery power (which does not work very well), as well as propane. \n \n This is to provide security for the camper (it will not tip) while still allowing the frame to flex while raising the roof. \n \n This is done using the same handle that you used to lower the supports. It inserts into the roof crank spot at the back of the camper. \n Crank clockwise to raise the roof until it will not turn anymore and the roof is at it's full height. \n You will feel some increased resistance when they contact the ground. Give them just a little snug after that. There is no need to crank too tight. \n These are located at the four corners of the camper near the bottom. \n You will be pulling out the beds soon, and it will be more difficult to remove things after that., As you pull it firmly out stay aware of the position of the canvas to make sure it is not catching on anything. If something doesn't feel right STOP. \n Check the canvas, pull it away from anything it could catch. \n Check the inside of the camper to be sure the bed isn't catching on something. \n It is necessary to pull firmly, but if it's not moving, something is wrong. Don't force it. \n \n Position the free end of the support pole onto the stud on the frame of the camper. \n Repeat this with the second support pole. \n You will feel the bed come up as you lift and then it will sit down solidly when you set it down.\n Repeat this process with the other bed. \n \n This spot is on the door side of the camper. The stove sits about waist level. \n The lower bracket will rest on the side of the camper and will feel secure., Give the propane lines a few minutes to equalize pressure in the system before turning on or using anything requiring propane. \n The propane tanks are located at the front end of the camper. \n \n The hose hookup spot on the camper is on the side opposite the door side and near the back end. \n Switch on power to your camper's water pump if you don't have a water spigot and are going to be using your water tank instead. \n This switch is located inside the camper next to the galley. \n \n The drain fitting is on the back side of the camper. Your sink drains out of this fitting. \n \n The access panel is located near the front of the camper on the side opposite the camper door. \n Be sure to continue holding down the knob while doing this. \n The hot water tank should go into full fire mode and begin heating the water. \n If the pilot goes out, turn the gas knob to off and wait five minutes before repeating procedure. \n NEVER light a lighter or bring in an open flame if you smell propane. \n 
 This will help your body feel limber and warmed up, making it easier to planche. Proper stretching is a vital part of avoiding preventable injury. A planche is an advanced technique, so you'll need your body in its best order before you attempt it. \n Touch your toes. Keep your legs as straight as possible. \n Circle your wrists and hips. \n Stretch your arms by Crossing one arm over your chest and holding the elbow with the opposite hand; repeat on the other side.\n Crouch between either push-up bars or parallel bars with your hands grasping the bars on either side. If you don't wish to perform the planche on bars, squat down on the floor with your hands planted on either side of you. Make sure your hands are planted a comfortable distance apart, so you'll be able to support your body adequately. \n Before you lift yourself up, make sure your hands are planted facing forwards, roughly parallel to where your belly button will be when you lift yourself up. \n Experiment with different hand grips before you find one that works best for you.\n It's good to continue picturing yourself in a push-up position. As you lean forward however, you should be putting far more pressure on your hands than you would in a push-up. \n Leaning forward is a great way to train towards a planche, as it will get you used to the increasing pressure on your hands and wrists. \n All of your body's weight should be focused on your hands. Keep your body straight throughout. Because this technique takes so much upper body strength, it's unlikely that you'll be able to pull one off without training in increments first. \n A good way to imagine a planche is as if you were doing a push up where your feet aren't touching the ground. \n Because proper balance is so important during the planche, you need to keep your body straight. Tightening in your abdominal muscles will help keep your body rigid. \n Most professional gymnasts see 30 seconds as a good goal to hold the position for. When you complete the full planche, return yourself slowly to a resting "push up" position. \n It is fine if you cannot hold it for the full 30 seconds at first. Simply getting yourself into position is difficult enough. It is helpful to train yourself in increasing increments. For example, once you achieve the position, try to hold for 5 seconds. Once you're able to do that comfortably, aim for 10, and so on. \n Keep an eye out for the particular motion and stance in which the professionals execute their planche. Having a firm visual reference will help you figure out the specifics yourself. \n It may look very easy when professionals planche, but it is, in fact, an extremely difficult process. Even professional gymnasts may take years to properly figure it out. \n Although even the most basic planche is quite difficult to pull off, it's a more achievable goal to someone starting out. You should be able to hold each of these moves for at least 30 seconds before you try the next step in the process. \n Planching takes at least six months from the start of your training to being able to capably pull it off. You should keep this in mind and aim to be patient with your progressions., However, unlike a regular planche where your legs would be extended, keep your legs tucked in under your body. This will reduce the amount of strength and balance required to hold the planche. \n When you're comfortable with a tucked planche, an advanced tucked planche will push your limits. An advanced tucked planche differs from a regular tucked planche because your legs are extended in an L-shape at the knee. This should increase the difficulty, both in terms of strength and balance. \n Tucked planches are easier because the weight is more situated towards the area you're lifting from., As you push yourself upward, extend one leg outward while keeping the other tucked as with a tucked planche. \n You should alternate between legs. This will strengthen up the two sides of your body, and make them both ready for a full-blown planche. \n A straddled planche differs from the full planche in that both of your legs will be spread. Although you'll have the full body extension of a planche, the distribution of weight will be a bit easier to handle. \n Once you're able to consistently pull off straddled planches, you should be ready for a full-blown planche. \n When you've mastered this elite exercise, kick it up a notch by doing pushups. In the planche position, bend your arms at the elbows to lower your body to the ground, then straighten your arms to come back up. Keep your torso, legs and toes in a straight line parallel to the ground the whole time. \n It's simple math: the less weight you have on your body, the less exertion you'll need to keep your body straight and stable. Gymnasts benefit from keeping their body fat percentage as low as possible. Cut down on empty calories and focus on training cardio exercises when you're not busy with gymnastics. \n Planching is all about balance and upper body strength. Handstands will help acclimate you to putting your body's pressure on your hands. This may be done with a wall-assisted handstand as well. Place your feet up on a wall, plant your hands on the ground, and step your feet up the wall to get you in a handstand position. Try to hold for at least 30 seconds. \n Getting someone to help you with handstands by holding your body in place is a great way to start if you're not used to gymnastics yet., Though it shouldn't come as a surprise to most, proper eating will have a major effect on any kind of athletics. This is especially true with gymnastics, where any amount of "empty calories" runs the risk of adding extra weight for you to carry around. Organic food is recommended because it maximizes the amount of nutrients you get in the same amount of food. \n Drink sufficient water.Keep a water bottle with you wherever you go. \n Because a planche requires a high level of strength and balance, you should aim to get at least 7-9 hours each night. More sleep may be appropriate on nights before a big training day. \n A perfect planche can take years to perfect. Even professional gymnasts have trouble with this. Start small, and work your way up slowly. Don't give up, and learn to identify small improvements in your form. This is vital to keeping your morale up. \n 
\n This way you'll know where the power-ups are and where the enemies should be. \n \n Shield gun, Primary; charges a melee attack that deals 150 damage. If you manage to get to him. ;) Secondary; A shield that slowly degenerates over time. It doesn't protect your legs.Useless against rockets, mini-gun, flak and shock combo's. Close range, not advised. \n S.M.G., Primary, very weak and inaccurate automatic fire. Do not use this. Secondary, Grenades deal a steady 70 damage. Charge them full and use them as ghetto rockets. \n Bio-rifle, primary; Little green blobs doing 40 damage when they hit. On the ground they act like mines exploding after 5 seconds. Secondary, Charge up a big blob doing a whopping 250 damage in the case of a direct hit. Hard to aim. Medium close range. \n Shock-rifle, arguably the most useful weapon. Primary; a hit-scan doing 40 damage. Secondary; a slow moving bolt doing 45 damage. Combo; Shoot the secondary with the primary shot and BOOM. Long to medium range. \n Mini-gun, Primary, powerful machine gun, inaccurate. Secondary, extremely accurate machine gun, at expense of damage. Close to medium range. \n Link-gun, Highest DPS weapon, although easily dodged. Primary shoots green bolts. Extremely useful in close combat. Secondary is a constant stream doing 50 damage per sec. Close range. \n Rocket launcher. Primary shoots a single rocket, medium range. Secondary charges a 2 to 3 rocket barrage. By keeping the right button pressed and clicking left, you can shoot a 3 rocket spiral. Medium close range. \n Flak cannon, Primary, shoots out hot chunks of metal, in a shotgun like fashion. Useful in close combat. Secondary is a grenade/mortar, direct hit does 90-160 damage. Close to medium range. \n LG, A sniper with a beacon so everyone knows where you are. Direct hit deals 70 damage, head shot makes for 140. Secondary is the zoom. Long medium range. \n Just get in and shoot it with a redeemer. It will take away its integrity by 50%! \n This way you get a wide variety of weapons that can be used for different situations. This can be used for vehicles and power-ups. \n 
 You need to examine the topography of the land and do an inventory of the existing features and objects that you can use as obstacles, cover, vantage points, hiding spots, observation points and team bases.\n If possible, you can take a birds eye view picture overlooking the whole land. If not, you can make a sketch drawing of the map. \n This could include natural features like a ditch or a hill, trees or walls, rocks or old junk parts of vehicles. \n Keep an eye open for and note down potential lookouts, trap locations, obstacles and observation points. \n Bringing a ruler and a laser rangefinder can be very useful while surveying. \n There may be signs of wild animal tracks, nests and prints, poisonous plants or vegetation with thorns that you may have to remove, or put boundaries. \n You may have old furniture like an entertainment center that is too small for your new flat screen filling space in your garage, leftover fence boards, fence posts or other materials staked in your yard or patio. \n Many people post on some sites like [[Give Stuff Away on Craigslist| Craigslist to give away a wide variety of items, materials, and tools that you can use for your build. There are some people that would be happy to drive up to your location and haul topsoil, concrete chunks, and chopped tree logs for you to construct your airsoft course at no cost to you. \n Reusing automotive waste that recycling centers won't take is a good way of helping reduce waste. \n You will need good quality and solid beams and boards to safely construct your bunkers and towers. \n Have team and community members bring some tools for the build. You will be using a jigsaw to cut and shape the plywood boards to make interesting funny, artistic, and creative decorations, walls, and decoy targets through out the course. \n Rent digging and other heavy equipment. \n You can paint certain locations, segments, and landmarks a different color. This way the teams can communicate and use strategy by being able to locate and navigate around. \n You can place motor driven Garage/Gate openers walls to change the layout of the field and create more challenge for players. \n Place motion sensors at strategic places that activate doors, booby-traps, Supply-crate-drops with extra ammo. You can find a variety of different circuits or apparatus in a hardware store or salvage from automobiles or home security lamps. \n Connect light fixtures with a motion sensor to electric power supply and screw in an adapter to the light bulb socket to power the motors, sirens, or the air-soft turret gun. \n Most electrical connections and hardware assembly can be safely done by someone with basic electrical and construction experience. \n \n Use compressed air If there is no electrical power available. \n Use simple 2 gallon compressed air tanks (66 -125 PSI) or even old inflated tires (25-35 PSI) which have more air capacity and will be enough even at lower pressures. \n Run air hoses or piping underground and place pressure activated valves under switch-plates. \n Point a paint-gun or air-soft cannon directly on the path of the switch-plates. \n \n Install laser and reflectors, used on some convenience stores entrances, at strategic places as trip-lines. \n Every time the laser is triggered it will beep once, this will count as one team member in that location. \n 
 Bylaws are an organization’s written rules. Bylaws are important because they can help resolve problems or conflicts that arise. For example, if you have difficulty with an officer of the organization, then you can read the bylaws to see what steps you are authorized to take. Bylaws can also cover the following:the organization’s name \n the organization’s purpose \n membership requirements \n the titles and responsibilities of officers \n how officers are assigned \n how meetings will be conducted and when they will be held\n To start, it is necessary to consult with most or all members who helped to start an organization. Pull in at least two or three other people to give input and help write the bylaws. \n If you are starting a non-profit organization, for example, you will need a board of directors who will then give input and help write the bylaws. Working as a team ensures that all perspectives will be represented and accounted for in the bylaws. \n Try to make sure that the bylaw committee reflects an accurate cross-section of your organization.Do not tilt it too heavily with people from one section of the organization or one level of the organization’s hierarchy. \n To properly draft bylaws, you need to understand the organization: its purpose, how officers will advance that purpose, and the future of the organization. To gather this information, meet with all members of the organization and talk about how they envision the organizations’ purpose and what jobs will be necessary to make that purpose a reality. \n You also want your bylaws to be consistent with other core documents, such as your articles of incorporation, governance policies, and any other documents that reflect how the organization is operated. Gather those documents as you prepare to draft the bylaws. \n In particular, make sure the number of board positions and position descriptions are the same on all documents. Make sure too that the meeting days are the same, along with other minor details. If you are affiliated with another entity, such as a state department of education or similar, you should confirm that your bylaws are consistent with that entity’s expectations and requirements., Try to find bylaws for organization similar to yours. You should never simply copy them, but they can serve as a useful guide when drafting your own.Call organizations like yours and ask if you can see a copy of their bylaws. \n Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in non-profits can be useful in making sure that your bylaws cover the necessary ground. An attorney can also make sure your bylaws harmonize with your state’s non-profit law. Non-profit laws may contain prohibitions, such as limitations on proxy voting, and you should be aware of these before drafting your bylaws.Any bylaw article that violates your state’s non-profit law will be void. \n You can find an experienced attorney who specializes in non-profits by visiting your state’s bar association, which should run a referral service. \n If costs are a concern, you may be able to get help from a pro bono organization in your area. Legal aid organizations typically help indigent individuals, but many also help non-profit organizations. You can search for legal aid organizations by visiting this website. \n Bylaws are typically written with section headings called “articles” and paragraphs called “sections.” This structure will make your bylaws more readable and standardized with other bylaws. This format also facilitates finding information on voting rules, committees, and other elements you may have questions about as the organization gets going., These headings will be in all capital bold letters and numbered with Roman numerals. Center this heading on the page. \n For example, the first article would be titled: ARTICLE I: ORGANIZATION. The second article would be titled: ARTICLE II: PURPOSE. \n For each section in every article, number them clearly and give a one- to two-word descriptor of the section. \n For example, you might write: Section 1. Regular Meetings. This would be followed by a brief description of the protocol for regular meetings. Then you’d write: Section 2: Special Meetings. This would be followed by a brief description of protocol for special meetings., Bylaws are legal documents, so you want to sound professional. When looking at a bylaws template or sample, study the language they use. Keep an appropriate tone and use understandable vocabulary. \n Although bylaws are legal documents, you do not need to use obscure “legalese.” Instead, you should use simple language that is easy to understand.Keep details for policies, not the bylaws. The bylaws are the guidelines with which to implement specific policies. Therefore, the bylaws should be flexible and able to be interpreted in conjunction with more detailed policies. Keep the bylaws fairly general. \n Many templates and other instructions regarding writing bylaws are intentionally general so that they can be tailored to your organization. Your organization might have specific needs that require certain elements that other organizations do not. \n Writing church bylaws: A church’s bylaws will include a section about the congregation’s minister. This section would address the minister’s relationship to the congregation, the qualifications the minister should have, and the process for bringing on a new minister or dismissing the current one.Sample language might start out with: “The Minister is the religious and spiritual leader of the church. He or she shall have freedom of the pulpit and of speech. The Minister is an ex official member of the Board and of all committees, except the Nominating Committee.” Writing corporate bylaws: For corporate bylaws, you might also include sections that address frequency of shareholder meetings, issues pertaining to company stock, and so on., This is a brief statement that identifies the official name of your organization. You can also give the primary operating location of your office in this article. If your organization is not physically fixed to a location (if you are a primarily online group, for example), you do not need to include an address. \n You might write in this section: “The name of the organization shall be the ABC Elementary PTO.”, This article will include your mission statement and vision for the organization. This can be a fairly basic one-sentence statement. You can make it more complex, if you so choose. \n Sample language might read: “The organization is organized for the purpose of supporting the education of children at ABC Elementary by fostering relationships among the school, parents, and teachers.”, This article will address several sections, including eligibility (who can become a member and how), dues (do members need to pay a fee to join? Do they need to pay a fee annually?), classes of members (active, inactive), requirements for how to remain a member, and how to withdraw from membership.Sample language for the first section under the Membership heading might read: “Membership is open to all who sympathize with the church's purposes and programs, regardless of race, creed, gender, sexual orientation, age, national origin, and mental or physical challenge.”Continue with subsequent sections describing dues, requirements for remaining a member, and how to withdraw from the organization. \n This article will address several sections pertaining to officers, including listing each office, the duties related to each office, how officers are nominated and elected, terms of office (how long they can serve in their position), and how to handle vacancies. \n For example, for the first section, you might write: “The officers of the organization are a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and three directors.”Then you will follow this with the other sections regarding officers, providing a description of each officer’s duties, and so on. \n This article covers several sections that outline how often meetings will take place (quarterly? Semiannually?), where the meetings will take place (at the primary location of operation?), and how votes can be cast for motions. \n This article also establishes the number needed for a quorum, or the number of board members who must be present for motions to be carried. If an organization has nine board members, and the bylaws require two-thirds of the board to make up a quorum, then at least six board members must be present to make decisions for the organization. Some states may require a minimum for a quorum; check with your Secretary of State to find out your state’s requirements.Sample language for the first section of this article might read: “Regular meetings of the society shall be held on the first Tuesday of each month.” Then proceed to address the other sections in the rest of this article. \n These committees are specific to your organization, but they might include a volunteer committee, publicity committee, membership committee, fundraising committee, and so on. Include a brief description of each of these committees. Follow this section with a brief description of how committees can be formed (appointed by the board of directors?). \n Sample language might read: “The society shall have the following standing committees,” followed by a list and brief description of each committee that you have. \n You should specify when a budget will be created, who will be responsible for keeping financial records (usually the treasurer), how expenses are approved, and what will happen to funds should the organization dissolve.For example, you could write: “A budget shall be drafted in the summer for the following fiscal year and shall be approved by a majority vote of the Board.” \n Then, you can assign to the treasurer (or another officer) responsibilities for keeping financial records: “The treasurer shall keep accurate records of any disbursements, income/credits, and bank account information.”, Parliamentary authority is the set of guidelines that govern your procedures for how your organization is run. Many organizations abide by Robert’s Rules of Order, a guide for how to run meetings in an assembly of people in order to ensure that voices are heard and taken into account.An article on parliamentary authority will also name the specific resource that guides the bylaws, procedures and operation of the organization. \n Sample language might read: “Robert’s Rules of Order shall govern meetings when they are not in conflict with the organization’s bylaws.”, While the bylaws are intended to be useful and to accommodate many situations that might arise in an organization’s life, from time to time they do require amendments. You should write into the bylaws what amendment process you will use. Including an amendment process will demonstrate that your organization is flexible and understanding of change. \n Do not make it too difficult to amend the bylaws. Instead, choose a process that is appropriate for the culture and politics of your organization.You can also include a section here that states your fiscal year, or you can include a separate article that states your fiscal year. \n Sample language regarding amendments might read: “These bylaws may be amended or replaced at any meeting of the society by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of those present and voting. Notice of any proposed change shall be contained in the notice of the meeting.”, Your organization should protect itself against a personal or financial conflict of interest from the board of directors or other officer. Include an article that specifies what should happen if someone has a conflict of interest. \n Sample language might be: “Whenever a director or officer has a financial or personal interest in any matter coming before the board of directors, the affected person shall (a) fully disclose the nature of the interest and (b) withdraw from discussion, lobbying, and voting on the matter. Any transaction or vote involving a potential conflict of interest shall be approved only when a majority of disinterested directors determine that it is in the best interest of the corporation to do so. The minutes of meetings at which such votes are taken shall record such disclosure, abstention and rationale for approval.”, Some state laws require a dissolution clause, or a statement that describes how the organization can be closed down. This can be a good idea even if your state does not require this clause, as it can help protect your organization in the event of in-fighting. \n Here, you might write: “The organization may be dissolved with previous notice (14 calendar days) and a two-thirds vote of those present at the meeting.”Some states require organizations to include a dissolution clause in their bylaws. Check with your state’s Secretary of State for specific information., Use consistent formatting throughout the document and use one font and one font size (11- to 12-point font is most readable). Include a title page with the name of your organization, the date of the last revision of the bylaws, and when the bylaws go into effect. \n Your bylaws will outline procedures by which to run the organization, conduct meetings, elect officials or committee leaders, and so on. These procedures are based on rules that dictate what happens first, how many people need to vote to reach a decision, who can vote by proxy (sending in their vote instead of voting in person), etc. A professionally credentialed parliamentarian is someone who is an expert in these rules and procedures. \n Parliamentarians can be found by contacting associations such as the American Institute of Parliamentariansor searching online for “professionally credentialed parliamentarian” in your state. You will likely need to pay a consulting fee for their services. \n The bylaws need to be accepted by the organization in order for them to take effect. The director of the organization generally has the authority to adopt the bylaws.Include a statement at the end of your bylaws that attests to their adoption, and include the date of adoption. The secretary of the organization should sign this statement as well. \n Some states require that bylaws are filed with the state, while other states require only periodic reporting of key personnel and financial information.Check with your Secretary of State to find out if you need to give a copy of your bylaws to your state agency. \n Corporate bylaws are typically not filed with any official agency. Many states require that corporations write bylaws,but you don’t have to file them with your state. They may be shared with stockholders and other key individuals, however., Store them in a binder with your articles of incorporation, minutes of meetings, list of names and addresses of directors and other principal executives of the organization, membership records, and so on.It can be a good idea to make your bylaws easily accessible to your members by posting them on your website or having them readily available at your offices. While there is no requirement that bylaws should be publicly available, doing so could make your organization seem more accountable and transparent., Having the bylaws on-hand will be useful when you hold membership or executive meetings. Consult the bylaws when you are voting on a motion, deciding on committee or board members, or otherwise engaging in activities specifically outlined in your bylaws. Your meetings will run smoothly, and members will be reassured that their views are properly represented. \n As your organization changes, your bylaws may also need to change. The key to making the bylaws adaptable to change is to make them flexible and amendable in the beginning. For example, you can include a range of the number of board members the organization will have instead of a hard number.Then you can either amend the bylaws to accommodate minor changes, or revise the bylaws to incorporate more substantial changes. \n You can make minor changes with amendments, which may cover the addition of a new committee, for example. \n If you are going to revise the bylaws, you should first hold a meeting of the organization’s members in order to provide input on what the revisions should be. Give notice to your membership that you will be holding a meeting to discuss and revise the bylaws, and give them the opportunity to submit changes for consideration. \n A few subcommittees should work on the revisions: one subcommittee can write the revisions, another subcommittee can check these revisions for inconsistencies, and a third subcommittee can check the revisions for spelling and grammar. Present the final revisions to the membership to vote on the changes.
 Make everyone in this family light-skinned and, except for the mother, set everyone's favorite food to hot dogs, hamburgers, spaghetti, or cookies. The mother's favorite food can be one of the above or autumn salad.\n Give him short brown hair and either no facial hair or a well-groomed mustache. Dress him in a business suit or in business casual clothes. Give him the traits Family-Oriented, Friendly, Brave, Handy, and either Workaholic or Animal Lover. \n Give her long blond hair, subdued makeup and stud earrings. Dress her in a relaxed style. Use the traits Family-Oriented, Friendly, Natural Cook, Neat, and Animal Lover (although if you have the Generations Expansion pack you can substitute one of these for nurturing/earn the trait it if you have University Life.) \n Make her look like a younger version of the mother, except for a girly hairdo. Give her the girliest outfits possible (but make sure it matches.) Use the traits Good, Artistic and Bookworm (the last is because we are going to make her less athletic than her brother). Set her favorite color to pink. \n Use the Play with Genetics option for his looks. Give him sporty clothes (extra points if he is wearing a baseball cap turned forward). Use the traits Athletic, Computer Whiz and Loves the Outdoors. Set his favorite color to blue. \n An alternative way of naming the son would be to use a childish nickname for the father's name (David to Davy, Michael to Mikey, Robert to Bobby). \n Use the traits Friendly, Hyper and another of your choice. \n Use the traits Friendly, Lazy and Non-Destructive. \n \n Alternatively you can use motherlode fewer times and just edit one house to have 3 bedrooms. \n (Optional: a toy oven.) \n (Optional: a snake or lizard terrarium.) \n
 If you don't know some one or more of these things, you may want to put this off for later.\n It is best to write on a blank document, because you can easily add/edit things, but with pen and paper you can organize it easily. Write "Packing List" neatly on the front of it. If it is for your whole family, you may want to divide the page in equal sections for each family member. \n If you are making lists, label the top of where each list will be. \n If you are going to be gone for 1-7 nights, you may want to consider bringing 1 shirt, 1 pair of pants, 1 pair of underwear, 1 pair of socks, 1 pair of pajamas, and for women, 1 bra, for each night you are staying. If you are washing clothes, you can pack less. If your trip is longer, consider packing 1 outfit and 1 pair of pajamas for every 3-4 days, assuming you will be washing clothing. Remember bathing suits, cover ups, extra pairs of shoes, scarves, coats, gloves, and other items to keep you comfortable. \n If you are going to spend 1-7 nights somewhere, bring your own shampoo and body wash, unless it's only one night (sleepover), then consider skipping a shower. Remember to bring toilet paper if you are spending over a week somewhere. For every 2 days you will be gone, bring one roll of toilet paper, just in case where you are staying doesn't supply it. Don't forget razors, deodorant, hairbrushes, toothbrush, hair straightener/curling iron, and for women, tampons/pads. \n Books, magazines, MP3's, phones, and CD's all qualify as entertainment. For a quick 1 night stay, you might only want to bring a magazine instead of two or three books, because you won't get around to reading them overnight. Remember, if where you are staying doesn't have a DVD player, don't take DVD's! \n Pillows, blankets, and sleeping bags all should be put down. If you are spending 1-7 nights somewhere, don't plan on washing your sheets. Take what you need for your bed (if it is on a bed or on the floor) and maybe an extra sheet, just in case. If you are spending a long time somewhere, take two sets of sheets and rotate them every other week. \n You'll need something to wash your clothes with for long stays. Check with where you are staying to see if they have cleaners, and if so, what kinds. \n For most people, this should be your wallet or purse and a passport, if your leaving the country. If you are just spending the night, you may want to take no money because you probably will not have to buy anything. \n If you have any pills you have to take, write these down. Make sure to take bandages, vitamins, and pain relievers wherever you go, unless its just a sleepover. Remember things like First-Aid kits, motion sickness remedies, and sleep medications. \n MP3 and Cell Phone can go here or in the entertainment section. Remember a cell phone charger, camera, alarm clock (if you need to wake up at a certain time), laptop, and walkies-talkies if you need these items. \n Sunscreen is a must for almost anywhere you go. Tents, sleeping bags, flotation items, beach towels, buckets, shovels, and things of such are good for spending time at the beach or camping. Remember insect repellant and flashlights for camping. \n Wipes, diapers, baby powder, 'sippy cups', and strollers are good for young kids. \n Did you remember everything or did you put on some extra items? Cross off and add on what you really need. Remember that if you are traveling far, you can buy some things when you get to your location. \n

 Showing your child how beautiful the natural world is will make them more keen to do their bit to keep it that way. \n Plenty of vegetarian and vegan substitute meat products exist that have become very sophisticated to the point that a child that's never eaten chicken in their life wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Nuts, beans, and pulses are all good alternatives to meat-based proteins as well. \n Dairy products such as milk have also got convincing versions made with processed soy beans. While the taste of the fake cheese may leave something to be desired, you'd be surprised how many different plant materials can be turned into more ecological sources of calcium. \n The Coca-Cola Corporation robs people in distant nations of the water that runs right beneath their feet, so it's a huge moral decision to give it up as well. \n Fruit juices may seem like a good alternative to pop, but they have their own share of faults. They take huge amounts of water and energy to be produced, and are full of very harmful natural sugars. Your best bet is to stick to good old-fashioned tap water. \n \n A damp flannel should be sufficient to wash a child's face if they've stained it with food or outside dirt. \n If they're so dirty they must have a proper wash-up, it's a tie between a 5-minute shower or a shallow bath. A power shower uses up more water than a full tub in just a few minutes, so set the head to a low-flow setting. \n If you want to be really picky, then don't use them if there's no marking saying that the product has not been tested on animals. \n Also encourage them to only flush the toilet when it's absolutely necessary. \n Some may need more store-bought items, some eat more meat, etc. \n A cat might have a smaller diet and therefore fewer emissions. They are notorious back yard predators that kill dozens of birds, mice, and other mammals and reptiles in their 20+ year lifespans. \n A rabbit or a turtle is a greener alternative to the latter animals, as they're vegetarian and can spend most of their time in the yard if supervised. However, if a rabbit doesn't have a strong hutch it faces threats from predatory mammals and birds, and turtles can't sustain themselves outside in the winter months. \n The most environmentally-friendly pet (post-manufacturing and shipping) is a stuffed one. A teddy bear needs no food or water, no walks, and no expensive vet bills. \n 90% of all domestic waste can be recycling, but only about 20% of it currently is, with the rest ending up rotting in landfills or turned into energy at an incineration plant and lost forever. \n Recycling just one steel or aluminum can will save enough power to keep a plasma TV on for up to half an hour, and power a filament light bulb for over an hour so collecting waste gives you the potential to offset nearly all your household emissions. \n Let your child put some of the waste in themselves, even if it means giving them a leg-up. \n You may be able to start a campaign that will cause them to change their ways for the better, but only if you try to make an effort. Please ask the administrators of the school first before starting a campaign, though; you may end up wasting resources for no reason when all you had to do was ask. \n Examples could be arts and crafts, taking up a musical instrument (even electric keyboards would suffice over TV), or just play through imagination. \n Turn off computer monitors if they're not being used or put on standby or to hibernation mode and turn off a TV that won't be watched for more than 5 minutes. \n 99.9% of the time it probably is, but TV is an incredible tool that if used correctly can actually educate and enthrall in equal measure. A prime example of this are Nat Geo and the Discovery networks, which are brimming with eye-opening documentaries and may even have programming that relates to your green lifestyle. \n Wooden bricks and train sets are great toys for boys, and girls will enjoy a knitted or embroidered doll instead of a Barbie or Bratz.] \n A battery-free toy doesn't need to be inanimate; clockwork or wind-up technology has been used to make trains, cars, racing horses and more; you just have to know where to look. \n Most girls dress up as fairies, queens, and gentle animals like cows and horses. Boys, meanwhile, prefer other fantastical things like superheros, dragons, robots, and cowboys. \n Outside there are a load of new possibilities. A sandbox full of castle-building tools can provide hours of fun for children aged 6 and under. \n Make sure you only use scrap paper, plus by drawing on both sides, you make it last twice as long. \n 
 Research happens any time you actively seek out information about a specific topic. You can research to explore a topic you're unfamiliar with, as well as to provide evidence for claims you're making in a presentation or research essay. Research can be collected by gathering your own data, reading online, or using previous research projects to guide your efforts. \n Exploratory research is done when you read online, getting the quickest summary of the topic at hand. Say you were researching the general topic of "obesity" in the United States. To explore the topic, you might start with a Google search, read the wikipedia page, and find other web entries to get yourself familiar with the topic. What's the issue with obesity in the US? What arguments are being made about it? What other subjects are related to this topic? Health and fitness? Fast-food? What are you interested in researching further? In this kind of research, you're looking for facts. \n Supportive research occurs when you find those arguments in academic sources. What are academic sources? Anything that has been published, be it magazines, books, or the online database version of academic research journals. In this kind of research, you're looking for more than facts. You're looking for opinions and arguments of different sorts, related to your topic, that you can use to form an opinion and argument of your own. \n \n Once you've explored a topic somewhat, there's still a lot you might not know, and this is what you can use to guide your research by forming a research question. Start asking lots of questions and writing them down: When people refer to the "obesity epidemic," what are they referring to exactly? When did it start? Where? What are some possible reasons that it may exist? \n Within every topic there is an "issue," at stake. There's something debatable, something controversial about the topic, and that's what you want to spend time researching. The smaller, narrower, and more specific the topic, the better. \n The topic of obesity in the US might be too large. Look at your own community, state, or region. What are the statistics? How does it compare to other regions? What might account for this? Why? If you're asking and answering these questions, you're well on your way to a solid research topic. \n Issues of fact don't make good research topics, because there's nothing to research, there's just a fact to look up. A good research question, for instance, wouldn't be "How many people have died from obesity?" but "How does obesity kill?" \n After you've been exploring your topic online and possibly in print, you need to come up with a solid research question to help guide your supportive research."What policies and attitudes resulted in the sudden rise in obesity in Indiana during the mid-90s?" would be an excellent research topic. It's specific in terms of location, controversy, and topic. It's something you can prove. \n We all have strong opinions about topics, especially controversial ones. It can be tempting to only seek out sources that will validate your opinion, or that will oversimplify the topic, rather than complicate it. As you do your research, seek out a variety of opinions, arguments, and positions, and allow yourself to assemble the strongest possible research, not just the arguments you want to hear. \n Depending on your topic, the Internet may be a wealth of information or a swampy region of opinions and comment streams. It's got the most current information available instantly, but it can also be difficult to distinguish between good sources and bad sources. \n Government websites (ones that end in .gov) are good sources of data and definitions. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention site, for instance, has lots of good data about obesity in the US, how the disease affects specific populations, and a breakdown of obesity by region. \n Non-profits (websites that end in .org) can also be good sources of opinions. Generally, organizations will have an "agenda" and will present a variety of information that backs up their position. This can be good in aiding your research, but can also feature a fair amount of spin on the issues. \n Blogs and message boards can be good for getting a sense of people's opinions and are good for coming up with ideas for questions you can ask yourself, but they're not good sources of support. They're not good for quotes, in other words. \n Is obesity a disease? What do we mean by calling it an "epidemic"? These are terms you can and should look up quickly online. By defining your terms and becoming more familiar with the topic--becoming an amateur expert on it, in fact--you'll be more informed when you get to the much more technical kinds of sources you'll need to use for your supportive research. \n One of the great things about a wiki (like wikiHow!) is that the sources referenced throughout the article are available at the bottom of the page for you to explore yourself. These are often better sources of information than the wiki itself, and the organization of the page allows for you to use it as a summary of the information in those sources, rather than a source unto itself. \n When you're reading online, look for a mixture of statistics and data, as well as opinions. It's not necessarily helpful to have a ranting blog full of someone's conspiracies about growth hormones in school lunches being a conspiracy to keep kids obese, but there might be something there to inspire you. What is the deal with school lunches? What research has been done? Do more exploring and find a more substantial page with similar information. \n The most helpful source of information at libraries isn't books. Often, librarians sit idly by while students struggle on computers not twenty feet away, digging through a difficult swamp of bad information and poor sources. Talk to them! They're here to help. \n Bring your research question and any research you've done to this point, as well as any particular assignments or project descriptions that you've got with you. If you're doing research for a paper, bring the assignment sheet. \n Ask at the front desk for research librarians who are on-call for student consultations, or make an appointment yourself with a topic librarian in a specific field. These meetings tend to be very beneficial. You won't waste time trying to negotiate the difficult library databases, and you'll be sure the kind of information you find will be helpful for your project. \n At the library, you've got more information that you'll know what to do with. Try to find only the most directly-related information. If you're struggling to find good sources, try refining your search terms and looking again. \n Books obviously make for good overviews of topics. If you're researching obesity, you'll be able to find long-range research studies, expert analysis, and opinions on books in the subject. \n Magazines and research journals will provide more specialized and technical topics, usually at a somewhat shorter length. They're be lighter on opinion and heavier on dry statistics. \n Most university libraries use JSTOR or some variant of an academic database that houses research articles by topic. It can be a somewhat difficult database to negotiate, so talk to a librarian for help if you're unsure. \n It can be frustrating when you first get started at the library in trying to find information directly related to your searches. Learning to search effectively and be diligent with your efforts will pay off in the end. Vary your searches, using quotations around specific searches you want the engine to look for. If you were looking for information about obesity, specifically related to the school lunch program, you might search for: \n "obesity" \n "obesity" "school lunch" \n "school lunch" \n "junk food in schools" \n "Indiana obesity" \n "Indiana school lunches" \n "weight epidemic" \n "obesity epidemic" \n Learning to read quickly and skim effectively for important and on-topic information is often the difference between a smooth research project and a frustrating one. If you're getting deep into a really complicated technical topic, a lot of the research can be dry and downright boring. Learning to negotiate the sources quickly will make your job much easier. \n Read the abstract, if the source has one, or read the introduction to the source to make sure the topic is applicable. If it seems peripheral, put it back and forget about it. You're not doing research to pad your bibliography, you're doing it to support your argument and explore the topic. \n If you find a good source, skip forward to the end and read the summary. Much of the "meat" of technical research-based sources will be spent presenting their own research, whereas you're mostly concerned with the findings and the argument itself. Often, you can get away with only reading a few paragraphs of a 15 or 20 page research report or book if you read smart. \n If the source provides excellent support, read the article more closely to get a sense of the argument and the evidence. Use the author's own research to look for more sources. \n There's nothing worse than getting to the writing phase of a research project at not being able to find a particular quote or statistic in the pile of research you've collected. Stay organized while you're researching and take careful notes to refer to later. \n Take note cards to the library and write down specific quotes on one side of the card and the bibliographical information (Title, author, publication info, and URL if applicable) on the other side of the card. \n A good day at the library doesn't necessarily involve stacking up a mountain of 500-page books you'll never read. Research smart, taking notes on the most important parts of the information, and use a manageable number of sources to make your argument and serve your argument. \n Some students think more sources makes a research paper better. It doesn't. Ideally, you want a balance of "their" voice--meaning the research--and your voice, your argument. A good research project uses the research to form and support an argument, not to act like a ventriloquist dummy, repeating information you read at length. \n Some topics and projects will call for primary research, which means that you'll collect the data yourself. If you've got a really localized topic--like the obesity problem at your University, for instance--you might want to consider creating a short questionnaire or other way of analyzing data of concern to your project., No surveys or questionnaires get to everyone. How many would be enough to get a good sense of the issue. Will it mean anything to gather opinions about obesity form 20 guys in the locker room? Everyone on your dorm floor? 300 people at the football game? \n Be conscious of bias. Aim for a somewhat distributed mix of men and women, of different ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, and places of birth. \n If you're after opinions, a questionnaire is the best and most efficient way of collecting data, but it might not be particularly applicable to your topic. \n If you're interested in food habits and the availability of junk food in cafeterias, consider posting up beside the lunch line a few days a week and counting the number of students who forego the full lunches in favor of deserts, sodas, or candy. Keep a running tally. \n Interviews might be good if you have access to experts or other parties involved directly in the topic you're researching. If you want to learn about school lunches, talk to the lunch workers, the principal of your school, or other people who may be involved. Let them know what you're researching and explain the project before talking to them. \n Once you've picked a method of collection, distribute your surveys, observe your behaviors, or conduct your interviews and collect your research. Analyze the research and summarize your findings in a way that you'll be able to use it for your research. \n If your hypothesis about the research ends up being wrong, don't fret. This in and of itself can be a good source of information to present in a project, displaying your commitment to finding out "the truth" of the topic at hand. \n When you've collected your research, identify the most persuasive arguments and sources and use them as a jumping off point for your own argument. If you found that districts with schools that feature vending machines experience a 30 percent higher obesity rate, how can you transition that into an argument to support with that research? What does the research say?, A thesis statement is the central thing you hope to prove by presenting your research. It should be debatable and specific, giving you a road map for where the research essay or project might go. A good thesis statement helps the writer as much as the reader, because it gives you a tangible thing to prove with the writing. \n A bad thesis statement might be "Schools need to do more to avoid obesity." This is vague and difficult to prove. What schools? What do they need to do? "Adams High School could significantly drop the obesity rate in the student body and even the region by removing the vending machines and offering a diversity of healthy choices" does a lot more to present an argument and give you something to prove. \n How do you present your research in a readable way? \n Paraphrase to translate a source into your own words. These should always be attributed, but not quoted, and are most effective when you need to briefly summarize a position or argument. You've still given credit to the author, so we know the observation isn't your own. In other words, you might write: \n According to Adams, schools that feature vending machines in the lunch rooms experience an increase in obesity rates. \n Quote any language directly sourced from the article. This is effectively used when there's something in the wording of the source that you want to emphasize or highlight as part of your research: \n According to Adams, "The inclusion of vending machines markedly increases the junk food desires of students in those schools, resulting in a chain reaction that rewards their bad choices." \n Learn to recognize and avoid plagiarism. It can happen accidentally, so you need to learn to recognize the ways in which it occurs and avoid it. \n If you're writing a research essay, you need to learn to effectively provide citation information for each source you reference, be it paraphrase or quotation, throughout the source. Use a parenthetical or footnote citation in the text of your paper, and include a list of references or a Works Cited page at the end of the paper including the publishing information for each source. Your teacher may want you to use a particular style of citation, but the most popular include: \n MLA \n APA \n Chicago Style \n Turabian \n

 The way certain exam boards structure their papers can vary, and you may need to study extra material if this is the case. This article serves as a guideline for all major exam boards.\n You cannot revise if you are talking to a friend or watching an episode of Friends. \n Also have a blank exercise book and a calculator at hand. \n However your school will not give it to you for free but may supply so you can buy from them revision guides which are also specific for your exam board. This are a great way to prompt yourself a week or so before the exam. \n Look through the textbook. Don't be intimidated by the big text and confusing words. Try to read the book and take in information. If you are still confused then ask your Biology teacher to help you. \n These short bullet point type notes will be easy to remember. \n This is usually for BMI (body mass index). In the exam they may give you the equation but remember it just in case. \n They help you understand what type of questions are in the exam and also help you know the areas you struggle with. \n For example "30 people take part in an experiment which was about how much exercise they do in a week, the line graph shows the amount of exercise they did and their heart rate. Suggest the link between the amount of exercise and their heart rate." Normally these types of questions will be broken down into 2 or 3 separate parts. For the question in quotation marks you need to tell the examiner the link between heart rate and the amount of exercise they do. Another part of the question is: "Is the test reliable?" In which the answer should "If the test was reliable it means if repeated the test will get the same results." Remember: Reliable = repeatable! \n Remember practise makes perfect. \n
 An accounting journal records the details, date, and amount of all the money flowing in and out of your business. It is non-specific, meaning that you record everything in the journal no matter where the money is going. You must first post your transactions in a journal before your post them in a ledger. \n There are many computer programs, like Quicken, QuickBooks, and more, which will help your write journals and ledgers accurately and efficiently. \n You need to have accurate documentation to create an accurate accounting journal and ledger, so save everything you have that relates to finances for later use. \n The sooner you log a transaction in your journal, the less likely it is to fall through the cracks and be forgotten. \n Using a spreadsheet or a computer accounting program, begin a new journal page by dividing the page up into five columns: \n Date \n Account \n Description \n Reference Number \n Debit \n Credit, Under your “date” heading, mark when a transaction was made. You should have a journal for every type of interaction your business does. If you receive a $500 check for your business on April 20th, 2015, start the journal entry with 4/20/15. \n You need accurate dates for accurate bookkeeping. Find a time at least once a week to log all of your journal entries to make sure you don't lose any. \n This is where the vocabulary of accounting is especially handy. Accounts are ways to think of how your money is being spent or earned. For example, the $500 check adds to your business’s cash, so it would be labeled 4/20/15, Cash. Some of the most common accounts include: \n Cash: Money that your business has on hand. This is not necessarily hard cash. If someone writes your business a $500 check, for example, it would be an increase in cash. \n Accounts Payable: These are business expenses you owe. For example, if the $500 check you received is a loan, you need to note $500 under your accounts payable journal.Accounts Receivable: This is money that your business is owed. \n General Journal: This journal is essential to capture all weird or one-time transactions, like bad debts, inflation, selling equipment, etc. \n Sales: The the revenue generated by selling your business’s product.Equipment, Wages, Land These three accounts, usually separate, detail the expenses needed to keep your business running. \n This is usually referred to as you “chart of accounts.” Usually, similar accounts are listed near each other, so you might label Wage Costs 501, Utility Costs 521, and Advertising Costs 531. This helps you easily order and reference you different accounts later on. For example, if you decide to label “Cash” as 101, then you can mark your check as 4/20/15, Cash, #501. \n The space between numbers (501 and 521) is so you can add new entries in between them. For example, if you are using physical books, or want to start a new journal every year, you might label “Wage Costs” as all account numbers 501-520, one for each of the next 20 years., After listing the date, account, and reference number, briefly describe the transaction. This only needs to be enough information to accurately remind you where the money came from or why it was spent. With the check example, you would write 4/20/15, Cash, #501, Check from Friend. Some other examples of descriptions include: \n ”Loan from Liberty Bank.” \n ”Money from tax return.” \n ”Sale of old oven.” \n ”Repairs to factory roof.” \n Debits are assets, or things that increase the worth of your business. For example, if you earn $500, you list it as debit. Credits are expenses, or liabilities, of your business, like loans or accounts payable. Simply list the amount of money spent or received under each account. For the check, you write out 4/20/15, Cash, #101, Check from Friend, $500 Debit. \n Debts and credits cancel out. For example, if you spend that $500 on a new oven for your bakery, you would note a $500 debt (Equipment) and a $500 credit (Cash). While you gain $500 in equipment value, you lose $500 in cash. Common debits include cash, accounts receivable, equipment, land, wages, and personal funds. \n Common credits include: cash spent, accounts payable, bills, mortgage, and loan payments. \n Remember-- debits are assets and credits are liabilities. \n For example, that $500 check you received for your business might be a loan, meaning you would have to write it down as both “Cash” and “Accounts Payable. Use separate lines under the same date and description to note both accounts and their amounts. \n 4/20/15, Cash, #101, Check from Friend, $500 Debit \n Accounts Payable, #201, Loan from Friend, $500 Credit, Every time any one of your accounts makes a change, record it in your general journal. Think of this document as the “story” of your finances – it tells the details of every economic interaction your business made in order. \n At the end of the day or week, take all of your receipts and invoices and check them against your journal to make sure you haven’t missed anything. \n Just like you labeled every single account, you should make a label for your journal. An example might be by date, such as “General Journal for 4/1/15 → 5/1/15,” or by simply using numbers to place journals chronologically, such as “Journal 1.” \n An account ledger notes every transaction by account -- so you have a ledger for Cash, Accounts Receivable, etc. You need to keep both a journal and a ledger so that executives, accountants, and staff can quickly look up your business's financial health by date and by type. \n If possible, make a record in your ledger immediately after writing in the journal. \n Journals are where you write the date, details and amount of every single business transaction based on its type. But ledgers break this information up into specific accounts, allowing you to see all of your transactions, like Cash, Accounts Receivable, Sales, on their own sheets. \n Make specific account ledgers based on their name and reference numbers. Your first ledger might be "Cash, #101." This ledger will illustrate every single cash transaction you’ve made. You will copy your journal entries into the appropriate ledgers, so you need a ledger for every account listed in your journal. \n Consider making a "Chart of Accounts" table of contents page to help you keep track of each account number. \n If you have odd expenses, consider a “general ledger” as well, which collects atypical transactions like tax returns, sales gone bad, personal expenses, etc. \n These can be copied directly from your journal entry on the transaction. For the $500 check, you can list “4/20/15, Journal 1, Check from Friend.” \n This allows you to quickly see what you own (debit), what you spend (credit), and how much you still owe (balance.) Your final sheet should look something like this: \n Date | Reference | Description | Debit | Credit | Balance | \n In a ledger, just like in a journal:Debit refers to money you receive. \n Credit refers to money you owe or paid. \n Balance refers to the what you still owe, or the difference between debit and credit. \n For example, if you have a $500 loan from a friend, start by noting down $500 as a debit. Say you make your first sale for $200 the next day and decide to start paying your friend back. Mark a new date, 4/21/15, and write $200 under your credit section. \n With the last example, you paid back $200 of the $500 loan your friend gave you. Subtract the payment you’ve made from the total you owe to find you balance. Here, you still owe $300, so note that as your balance to the right of your payment. \n In other words, the Balance = Credit – Debit. \n Not every expense will have a balance. If, for example, you receive a $20,000 research grant that you don’t have to pay back, you just note the $20,000 in the debit column and move on. \n Returning to the $500 loan from a friend, you must also note that you owe them the money in “Accounts Payable: \n /4/20/15 | Journal 1 | Loan from Friend | $0 Debit | $500 Credit | $500 Balance | \n This must occur every time there is a change to the account. If you decide to pay your friend back, for example, you would need to make a new entry \n /4/21/15 | Journal 1 | Loan from Friend | $200 Debit | $500 Credit | $300 Remaining | \n Any time a journal entry is made, that entry should be immediately posted to the ledger. For our example, we have the journal entry: Loan from a friend for $500. This journal entry affects 2 accounts (Cash and Accounts Receivable), so you must make entries to both of those ledger accounts. \n Turn to the Cash page of your ledger. In the left column (which is used for recording debits), write the date of the transaction, and then write the amount. In this example, the amount is $500. \n Turn to the Accounts Receivable page of your ledger. Write the date in the right column (which is used for credits), followed by the transaction amount. In this example, the amount is $500. \n Update these pages as new journal entries arise. \n For example, once you’ve paid off your total loan of $500, you might write out “Paid in Full” under the description, or a small notes section next to “Balance.” \n A full ledger details every single account so that anyone can flip through it to see exactly how much money is being made/spent in each category. The front page includes the chart of accounts, listing each account in the ledger and its number, such as “Cash, #101,” so that people can easily find the information they need. \n Add the accounts to the ledger in order for easy access. \n This lets you know the total amount you own or owe for each account. If the credits are higher than the debits, then that account is in losing money. This however, is to be expected – accounts payable will always be in debt, because it is a list of all the money you owe. \n Debit will always equal credit. This is an ironclad rule of accounting, and it makes sense: all of your money had to come from somewhere. If you bought something, you paid for it (credit) and now own it’s worth (debt). If there is any discrepancy, check your journal against your ledgers to find anything you forgot to record.Remember – any transaction, positive or negative, needs to go into the journal and ledgers. \n Some beginner accountants often forget the idea of “ownership.” For example, if you spend $10,000 on the business, then the business technically “owes” you $10,000. If the business was ever sold, you would be paid back your $10,000. \n Balance sheets are snapshots of your business’s assets and liabilities. This helpful form lists everything your company owns and owes at any given time, which can help you see any holes in your ledger. \n Posting to the general ledger is step 2 in what is known as the accounting cycle. On its own, the ledger wouldn't be very helpful, but used as a part of the cycle, it is an invaluable tool. The accounting cycle can be broken down into a few simplified steps. \n Collect the source documents, like receipts or invoices, that need to be logged. \n Record the transaction in the journal in chronological order. \n Post the journal entries to the ledger accounts. \n Prepare the trial balance. This is a listing of all the ledger accounts pooled together, and it should be prepared at the end of the accounting period. \n Prepare the financial statements. These can be compiled after adjusting the trial balance properly.
 This form should be used if you think you might be eligible for the additional child tax credit, or if any of your qualifying children have an Individual Tax Identification Number.Before you fill out this form, you need to have completed either the worksheet in Publication 972 or the worksheet accompanying your 1040 or 1040A. \n Part I determines whether those children meet the substantial presence test to qualify for the credit.Children identified by an ITIN must be physically present in the U.S. for at least 31 days during the tax year, and 183 days during the three-year period including the tax year and the two years before. \n When calculating whether the child was present for at least 183 days, not all the days the child was present in the country count. For purposes of the substantial presence test, the three-year period includes all days the child was present in the country during the tax year, one-third of the days the child was present in the year before that, and one-sixth of the days the child was present in the earliest of the three years.If all the children you claimed as qualifying children for the child tax credit have SSNs, you should skip Part I. \n Part II of Schedule 8812 is completely separate from Part I. \n Enter the amount from the sixth box of the worksheet in the 1040 instructions, or the amount from the eighth box of the worksheet in Publication 972 on the first line of Part II.On the second line of Part II, enter the amount of the child tax credit you claimed on line 52 of Form 1040,line 35 of Form 1040A,or line 49 of Form 1040NR.Subtract the second line from the first line and enter the result on the third line. If the result is zero or a negative number, you aren’t eligible for the additional child tax credit and don’t need to fill out the rest of the form. If the number is greater than zero, you still could potentially be eligible for the additional child tax credit and must continue to the next step., Publication 972 has a separate Earned Income Worksheet for 1040, 1040A, and 1040NR filers. \n Enter the amount of earned income you calculate on that worksheet on the line labeled 4A. \n Any nontaxable combat pay you’ve received from the military goes on line 4B. \n You’ll compare your earned income on line 4A to $3,000 to find the fifth line. \n If you have earned income of less than $3,000, you’ll leave the fifth line blank and enter a zero on the sixth line. \n If your earned income is more than $3,000, you’ll subtract $3,000 from the amount you entered on line 4A as earned income and enter the result on the fifth line. \n Multiply the amount you entered on the fifth line by .15 and enter that amount on the sixth line. \n If you entered zero on the sixth line and you have fewer than three qualifying children, you cannot claim the additional child tax credit. \n If you entered a number greater than zero on the sixth line and you have fewer than three qualifying children, your additional child tax credit will be either the number on the sixth line or the number on the third line, whichever is smaller. \n If you have three or more qualifying children and the amount you entered on the sixth line is greater than or equal to the amount you entered on the third line, the amount you entered on the third line will be your additional child tax credit. \n If you have three or more qualifying children and the amount you entered on the sixth line is less than the amount you entered on the third line, you must fill out Part III of the worksheet., If you are married and filing jointly, add your spouse’s to yours and enter the total. \n If you paid Additional Medicare Tax or Tier 1 RRTA taxes, you need to complete the appropriate worksheet in Publication 972 and enter the resulting amount on the seventh line. \n This item only applies to taxpayers filing a 1040 or a 1040NR. If you’re filing a 1040A, enter a zero. \n If you’re filing a 1040, this is the total of any deductible self-employment tax you entered on line 27 and unreported Social Security or Medicare tax you included on line 58, as well as any taxes you paid that you entered on line 60 using the code “UT.”If you’re filing a 1040NR, you entered these same taxes on lines 27, 58, and 60 of your form., This amount represents other taxes you paid that weren’t included in the previous calculation., Subtract the amount on the tenth line from the amount on the ninth line, and enter the result on the eleventh line. \n Compare the amount you entered on the eleventh line to the amount you entered on the sixth line. Enter the larger number on the twelfth line. \n Compare the amount you just entered on the twelfth line to the amount you entered on the third line. The smaller of those two numbers is your additional child tax credit.
 Turn off your phone, television, music devices and anything else that makes sounds or is visual. Distractions are called distractions for a reason. It’s because they distract you from yourself. This can be challenging to do, though, in the modern-day world, because stimulating, distracting activities are addicting. But, like any addiction, you have to cut it at its core to get anywhere. \n In order to start to fully hear the thoughts from your mind, you need your personal space to be completely quiet. If you have the TV blasting and the phone ringing every five minutes, it will be virtually impossible to tune into yourself. \n You don’t need to live a silent life for the rest of your life but only until you see that you have cleared out the troublesome thoughts, many of which have been stored in there for a long time and are now just on repeat. It could take anywhere from three months to one year of practice, but it will definitely be worth it in the end when you see that your mind is crystal-clear and trouble-free!\n For instance, you may see anxiety, stress, guilt, resentments, grievances, sadness, tension, and worries. An unexamined mind is usually an out-of-control mind filled with negative thoughts. Many mindfulness teachers state that this kind of thinking is from the psychological part of the mind and serve no helpful purpose other than being hurtful and damaging to you and sometimes in how you may see others, too.It’s helpful to think of awareness as a kind of fire, and it is through this fire of observation that you burn out old, trapped thoughts and begin to dismantle the much lower frequency, psychological part of the mind. \n The majority of meditation teachers believe that awareness is the most effective way to achieve lasting peace in the mind versus having it in pieces for so many of one’s waking hours., It usually comes as a surprise to those new on the mindfulness path as to how much time is actually spent in the past and future. Many even think that they are being constructive by going back and forth between these two time zones. However, all it really does is consume unnecessary mind energy with very little being accomplished. For the most part, focusing anywhere other than in the present moment is a waste of time. \n If you try to fight them, they will only grow in power, and you will have fallen victim to the mind’s clutches once again. The key is to just watch them without giving them any commentary. Other than the power of observation, you will not need to do anything else because this is, in and of itself, the true power. By guiding your mind into the present, it has no choice but to do exactly that, where you will see that most of the time, everything is more or less okay in your life. You begin to see that many of your thoughts were just phantoms, meaning completely imaginary based on fear and worry. If you think about it, these two states of mind do absolutely nothing except scare you and make matters worse because of how draining they are to your psyche. \n You will see that, indeed, they try to pull you away from a satisfactory time in your life through an endless stream of unnecessary, negative mental chatter. Thus, you can clearly see how preposterous the mind is when left to its own devices. \n Until examined closely, many people believe that the majority of their thoughts are useful and constructive. When, in actuality, they are bringing you down. So this particular experiment is a highly effective way to prove that the psychological part of the mind, until one becomes more conscious, consists of a lot of derogatory thinking. \n You may think that only sit-down meditation is effective. But it’s not true. It can be just as powerful to train your mind to stay in the present when you are doing your daily activities, like washing clothes, cooking, cleaning, brushing your teeth, etc. The key to mindfulness is to notice each and every part of what you are doing, while not thinking about other things. It can be easy to move through the various activities in life like a whirling dervish but then you miss moments that could have been enjoyable, for instance feeling the enjoyment of a steaming, bubbling bath. Remember life is in the journey, not the destination! \n Mantras are one of the best ways to begin to move away from the mind while at the same time dissolving embedded, negative thinking. Many find this hard to wrap their heads around but if you think about it, the past is over and the future will never come. So the only moment you ever have access to is the present one. It can take time to fully let go of what happened to you in the past and where you’re going in the future, but once you do, it’s extremely liberating! \n It's used to being in charge and doesn’t like its authority questioned. Like a professional boxer, it will fight you at every corner but don’t give in! You’re onto its games, and you’re not going to believe all the crazy lies it tells you anymore. \n Many of the things you hear in your head aren’t even correct anyway. Often, they’re just things that someone told you or what you made up yourself somewhere along the way based on faulty belief systems. That’s no fun going through the rest of your life thinking things that aren’t even true! But, you do have to become aware of them first before you can get rid of them. Things we aren’t conscious about stay with us, so starting with awareness first should be your top priority. \n Another big game of the mind is to say that trying to stay in the present is the most ridiculous thing you have ever done. Don’t believe that either! Your goal is to stay with the mantra until you stop hearing so much noise. Eventually it will comply, it just takes time to let the mind know that you are now holding the reins, not the other way around. \n Be forewarned; it is usually painful to look at your thoughts. In fact, in mindfulness circles, the name for it is the "pain body.” It consists of a lot of old, yucky, negative mind residue and like all residue, it takes time to scrub away. When it gets challenging, keep in mind that your awareness is the brush to a clean and purified mind. Once you get down and dirty, getting out of your head will rarely be a problem again. You’ll be on cruise control from then on!Saying a mantra as you do your daily activities is a powerful, ancient technique called “neti neti” in which you negate the thoughts in your mind to stay in the present. Meditation masters teach this technique for a reason; it really does work!, Sometimes there are people around, and it could look like you’re talking to yourself, otherwise! Though it could be a time to let your friends know how you're choosing to live in the moment these days versus being dictated by the limited constructs of what your mind says to you. \n You don't have to try and control the breath, just focus on it going in and out on its own. The breath can help greatly in warding off destructive emotions, like anger, frustration, and anxiety, which otherwise feel like they are taking over your body from the inside out. \n What happens with emotions is you often feel you have lost yourself and in a sense you have, for the moment anyway. One of the best tools you have in life is to just breathe, as the breath can only be in the here and now. It can help you to quickly get your balance from an upsetting situation or person, and the slower the better with each inhale and exhale. But not too intense. You don’t want to suddenly look like a fire-breathing dragon or like you need an inhaler! \n When these moments come over you, tell yourself to take it easy and relax back into the present. Before you know it, you’ll be back to feeling like yourself again and in control. Keeping in mind that those negative emotions were never the real you anyway and are meant to be let go so that they don’t get stored in the body., Buddha, along with modern-day teachers, teach that it’s these intuitive promptings from your higher self that are the real you, not the mind. The mind only represents your conditioning and ego. By moving away from it and into your being is when you are truly at your best. Everyone, in the ordinary consciousness state, moves into the self and away from the mind on occasion. But, with practice, you can live from this place of no-mind or no-thought most of the time. \n People who have learned how to be in no-mind report that they only think a small percentage of the time and when they do, it’s a pure, unadulterated form versus being all over the place. \n When you first start, this period of no-thought will be short, but it will gradually increase over time. When these periods do occur, however, you will feel a certain peace and stillness inside that you may have never felt before. Know that you are on the right track with your natural state of being, which has been obscured by the mind for so long. With practice, this sense of peace and stillness will deepen with you and will stay no matter what’s going on around you. \n Many people have such a vested interest in their mind that they are the ones who have the most challenging time getting away from it. So the less you buy into the antics of it, the easier time you will have trusting that your higher self knows what’s best for you. \n In other words, don’t hold on to them. What you will find with practice is that they will go as easily as they came into you. Also, like the mind, these emotions are not who you are as a being. However, they are a guide and are definitely needed in life. The key, though, is to not react to them on the inside. \n When you look at it this way, because it actually is accurate, it’s a much simpler way to live. \n Only use your mind for constructive purposes once you see that you are able to keep it mostly in the present. The best use of the mind, actually, is for critical thinking situations and for planning purposes. It can be easy to believe that you need to be thinking a lot about life in order to get you through. But, oftentimes, it’s just a hindrance to what you are doing. \n A great bonus to having worked on your mind is to see how much clarity you have now when you do choose to think! It’s true, too; you can choose when you want to delve into a matter, and the rest of the time enjoy life, as you’re meant to! \n When planning, though, make sure it’s actually planning and not just worrying about upcoming planning. If you find that it is worry, then the mind is, most likely, still controlling you versus you being in control of it. \n It definitely takes time for mindfulness training to solidify itself. \n If you have to go back to the mantra, trust that you are much farther along from when you first began. \n Many people believe that the past is much greater than the present moment but the problem with it, in actuality, is that the past really is over. It’s time to move on. By continuing to focus on it, just keeps you stuck and prevents you from moving forward in your life. \n Many experts who teach presence caution against dwelling on outdated shares on FB as well as old photographs from a happy time in your past. They even suggest not wearing clothes or using things that have been in storage for too long as they have an old, energetic influence to them. The key is to surround yourself with things that are vibrant and fresh. They may look perfectly fine on the surface but are still energetically stale. To a greater or lesser degree, everything has presence. \n When you live in the present, you actually can hear a sound from the universe if you listen carefully. Often, the reason people can’t hear it is because their ordinary, conditioned mind is jumbled up with too many thoughts. Focus, too, on the sound of the leaves, the birds and the water and all of the other sounds that you miss when you're too caught up in your mind., Non-acceptance of life’s moments is what causes suffering. This, however, can be a little tricky during challenging situations with other people. There are those instances where you have to let people know that you don’t accept what it is that they are putting out in the universe. \n The key here is to let them know clearly and emphatically without becoming angry or out-of-control. In other words, on the outside you may have to express yourself strongly so that people get it but you can still be accepting on the inside that this is, at times, just how life expresses itself. \n 
 If the victim is experiencing any symptoms besides pain and slight swelling, call emergency services. Also call if the identification section leads you to believe the scorpion could be dangerous, or if the victim is a child, elderly person, or someone with a weak heart or lungs. Some of these abnormal symptoms include muscle spasms, dizziness, and may also include those symptoms experienced with snake bites \n Find an online ambulance number listing to learn the emergency number for other countries.\n If you are not in need of immediate medical attention, call a poison control center to report your symptoms and request expert advice. If your region's poison control center is not listed below, search for your region's name and "poison control" online. If you cannot find one, call one of the following numbers long-distance, choosing one in a location as near as possible to you. \n In the USA, phone Poison Help at 1-800-222-1222, or search this database for a poison center nearer to you. \n Outside of the USA, locate a poison control center using the World Health Organization's database. \n The victim's approximate age and weight are useful for medical personnel to help them evaluate the risk and recommend treatment.If the victim has any allergies or medical conditions especially to insect bites or medicines, let the emergency services or poison center know. \n Also communicate the exact time the victim was stung if possible. If you're not sure, say so and mention when the injury was noticed. \n An emergency response service may not be able to advise you over the phone, but a poison control center should ask you for a detailed description of the scorpion. See the section on identifying scorpions for advice on danger signs and how to capture the scorpion if it is still around. \n Because scorpion venom can produce involuntary muscle motion, the victim may not be able to drive or walk if dangerous symptoms develop. Find someone with a car or other transportation that can take the victim to a hospital in case they cannot reach an emergency ambulance service. The victim should not be left alone for at least 24 hours, and preferably monitored for the next week in case symptoms worsen., No matter what, children, infants, the elderly, and people with a damaged heart or lung should always seek medical attention for a scorpion sting. Still, most scorpion stings can be treated at home, although the most dangerous venom requires professional medical attention. Seek medical attention immediately if you see any of the following symptoms.Vomiting, sweating, drooling, or foaming at the mouth \n Involuntary urination or excretion (peeing or pooing) \n Thrashing or twitching muscles, including involuntary head, neck, or eye movements, or difficulty walking \n Accelerated or irregular heart rate \n Difficulty breathing, swallowing, speaking, or seeing \n Severe swelling from an allergic reaction \n A scorpion sting may or may not swell noticeably. Any scorpion sting, however, will cause a sharp pain or burning sensation at the time of injury, followed by tingling or numbness. Sting areas generally are near lower portions of the body but may include the rest of the body. \n Gently remove any clothing from around the area and wash gently. This helps remove any residual venom around the area and keeps the wound clear to reduce risk of infection. \n Unlike some injuries, scorpion sting wounds should never be raised above the heart, as this can cause the venom to spread more quickly through your system. Keep the affected area at heart level or lower, and minimize the victim's movement to prevent a faster heart rate that will spread the venom more quickly, Anxiety or excitement can cause a faster heart rate, which will increase the rate that venom is absorbed. Reassure the victim if possible, and prevent him from moving. Remind them that the majority of scorpion stings result in no permanent damage. \n Apply the cold pack or bag of ice for ten to fifteen minutes at a time, waiting an equal amount of time between applications. This treatment is most effective within two hours of the time of injury.If the victim has circulatory problems, apply ice for five minutes at a time instead to prevent damage., Use ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen to relieve discomfort and pain. Always follow the directions on the label. Do not use opiate painkillers (narcotics), as these can suppress breathing. Ibuprofen and aspirin are best as they are both NSAIDs, or Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs that will help to reduce swelling. If pain is intense, seek medical attention. \n Unconsciousness or severe spasms are rare, but if they occur, call an ambulance immediately. Learn the basic steps of CPR and use them on the patient immediately if you have any suspicion her heart has stopped. \n Even if you feel that you've recovered through self-treatment, it is highly advisable to see a doctor or medical professional. In order to reduce the risk of infection and other complications, you may be advised to get a tetanus shot, take muscle relaxants, or use antibiotics. Do not give yourself these medicines without a doctor's advice. \n While the majority of scorpion stings are not harmful to adults, be aware of symptoms that indicate serious health risks. If any of the following describe the victim or his symptoms, seek medical attention before attempting to identify the scorpion:Children, infants, the elderly, and people with a damaged heart or lung should always seek medical attention for a scorpion sting. \n Vomiting, sweating, drooling, or foaming at the mouth \n Involuntary urination or excretion (peeing or pooing) \n Thrashing or twitching muscles, including involuntary head, neck, or eye movements, or difficulty walking \n Accelerated or irregular heart rate \n Difficulty breathing, swallowing, speaking, or seeing \n Severe swelling from an allergic reaction \n Identifying the scorpion species allows you to determine whether treatment is necessary, and in the case of venomous species, will allow medical professionals to give you the correct treatment.If you have a glass jar much larger than the scorpion (a quart or liter size is usually suitable), attempting to capture it will give an expert the greatest chance of identification.However, if you cannot see the scorpion, or do not have an appropriate container, do not attempt this step. \n Find a large glass jar, easily large enough to cover the scorpion and tall enough that your hands will be well out of reach of the stinger when you hold it upside-down. If you have them, find a pair of tongs that are at least 10 inches (25 cm) long. \n Capture the scorpion with the jar or tongs. Hold the jar upside-down and place fully over the scorpion. If you have tongs long enough to use them while staying out of reach, use them to firmly grasp the scorpion and place it into the jar instead. \n Fasten the lid. If the jar is upside-down, slide a large piece of heavy construction paper or cardboard under the opening, then hold it from the outside as you flip the container upside-down. Attach a tight lid or place a large, heavy book over the opening. \n If you do not have the correct tools for capturing the scorpion, photograph it instead. Take several photographs from different angles if possible. Having images to refer to will help you find details you may not remember, and if you need to seek expert attention, will help a medical professional identify the species for you. \n Scorpions with thick, fat stingers and tails are often more dangerous than scorpions with thin stingers. While it is still useful to capture or photograph the scorpion for specific species identification, you should seek medical attention even if you have not yet experienced serious symptoms, especially if you are in Africa, India, or the Americas. \n If you only got a good view of the pincers, you can estimate your risk from them as well: large, powerful pincers often indicate the scorpion relies on them for defense more than venom. This is not a foolproof system, but may be valuable information to pass on to a medical professional. \n If you are in the southwestern United States or northern Mexico, look for images of the "Arizona bark scorpion" online and compare them to the scorpion that caused the injury. Note that bark scorpions at high elevations tend to be striped, while desert dwelling bark scorpions are usually a uniform tan or light brown. The stings of these scorpions can be fatal and require immediate medical attention. \n If you are elsewhere in the United States, there is low risk of serious injury from scorpion stings.You should still treat the injury site as described below, and be prepared to see a doctor if you experience allergic reactions or other serious symptoms. \n The "deathstalker scorpion", also known as the Israeli desert scorpion, grows to a maximum of 4.5 inches (11.5 cm) and can vary widely in color and pincer size.Because of the risk of heart or lung failure associated with their stings, any sting from a scorpion smaller than an adult's hand encountered in this region should be treated by medical professionals as soon as possible. \n As noted earlier, fat-tailed scorpions can be extremely dangerous as well, and many species are found in this region. \n Unidentified, thin-tailed species are typically low risk, but due to the large number of scorpion species in Africa, not all of which have been thoroughly studied, be prepared to seek medical attention if any symptoms besides pain and slight swelling develop. \n Most scorpions in this area are not dangerous to adults, but there are exceptions. One of the more dangerous is the "Brazilian yellow scorpion;" as with many dangerous scorpion, it tends to have a thick, fat tail. \n The are few remaining scorpion species that can cause fatality or serious injury in adult humans, but as not all species have been identified, it is always a good idea to seek medical attention if the victim experiences any symptoms besides pain and mild swelling around the injury site. \n Stings from small, red or orange scorpions in India, Nepal, or Pakistan should be treated with medical attention immediately.These may be Indian red scorpions. \n There is low risk of death or serious injury for an adult due to scorpion venom from Europe, Australia, or New Zealand.Identification is still a good idea in case you do experience severe symptoms and need to report them to a medical worker. \n 
 If you have time before embarking on a trip or meeting with someone from another culture, try to take time to learn the basic “do’s and dont’s” of that culture. You can find information on this from internet sources such as those provided by the National Center for Cultural Competence., Different cultures will speak at different volumes, be more or less direct in showing emotion, may or may not expect to engage in “small talk,” and exhibit other dissimilarities in communication.When communicating with people from other cultures, be prepared to encounter such differences, including ones that you were not aware of. \n When communicating with a different culture, there may be unwritten rules about social hierarchy that you are not used to.For instance, you may come from a culture where men and women are expected to communicate equally with each other, but may have to interact with someone from a culture where men may do more talking in mixed company. Similarly, you may be communicating with someone who expects that a younger person should let an older person do most of the talking, while you expect people across age groups to communicate equally. \n If you could not understand someone, or think that he or she did not understand you, say something about it. Avoid being rude or offensive, but patiently explain the problem. It’s usually better to be upfront than to let a problem in communication go undressed, since there may otherwise be bigger problems later. \n If you think you did not understand what someone meant, try saying something like: “I’m not sure I understood you. Could we go over that again?” \n If you think that someone did not understand you, try saying something like: “Let’s review things to make sure we’re all on the same page.” You can also make sure to let the person know to ask questions. \n Each culture has its own set of dominant values, beliefs, and prejudices. Signs of these may emerge when communicating with people from other cultures. Basic communication, however, it is not the time to judge people based on these differences. Instead, respect them for what they are, and tolerate them.You may even learn something new. \n Even if cultural differences come up explicitly in conversation, be tolerant and open-minded instead of argumentative. For instance, if you are American and someone comments on Americans’ tendency to be work-focused, say something like: “Yes, it’s true that many Americans take work seriously, and there are a lot of reasons for that. Why don’t you tell me some more about how your culture thinks about work?” \n Communicating with people from other cultures can be enlightening and rewarding, but also have its difficulties. Expect that not everything will come out quite right or be fully understood. Be patient with others, and ask them to be patient with you. \n Likewise, even if there are difficulties in communicating with people from other cultures, do not treat other people as though they are unintelligent. Communication difficulties arise from cultural differences, not because of matters of intelligence. \n Be polite and use formal modes of address until it is made clear that you don’t need to (such as a business contact telling you to use first names).Depending on the cultures that are interacting, this may include addressing others: \n By first and last name \n By last name alone \n With a title such as “Mr.” or “sir” \n Using formal pronouns, if they exist in the language used for communicating \n If you will be communicating with people who speak a different language, try to learn a few basic phrases beforehand. Your situation may not require you or permit you to become fluent in the foreign language, but you can still try to learn some. \n Practice the basics, including: “Hello,” “Please,” “Thank you,” “How are you?,” etc. \n Carry a phrase book or electronic device that can help you find phrases you need and don’t know. \n Be patient when others are trying to use your language. \n If you are communicating with people who speak a different language, try to use their language at first, or as much as you can. Even if you can’t say much more than “hello” and “how are you?” in their language, the gesture is usually appreciated. \n Since a language’s slang and profanity are complex and highly dependent on context, it is best to avoid them altogether unless you are absolutely sure you know to use them properly. \n In some cultures, pointing with an index finger, giving the “ok” sign, and other common gestures can be seen as offensive.Since you may not know which gestures could be mistaken in this way, stick to “open handed” gestures.For instance, try using your whole hand if you need to point to something., This is because certain postures can be seen as offensive to others. For instance, showing your foot in some cultures is seen as a rude gesture, so you would not want to cross your legs in a way that your sole sticks out.If it becomes clear that a less formal posture is acceptable, you can follow suit. \n For example, some cultures may shake or touch hands more willingly than others.Don’t take it as offensive if another culture is more or less physical than you are used to when communicating. The exception is if you think you are being violated or abused. If you are uncomfortable, let others know. \n It’s a good rule of thumb to be conservative with the way you touch people from other cultures when communicating with them. However, if they appear to use more physical contact, follow suit if you are comfortable doing so. \n In some cultures, looking another person in the eye when you speak is seen as a sign of honesty and interest. In other cultures, however, it may be seen as disrespectful, confrontational, or a sign of sexual interest.Conversely, some cultures think than not looking a superior person in the eye when communicating is a sign of respect., For instance, Americans may smile frequently, while other cultures may see excessive smiling as a sign of shallowness. When communicating with people from other cultures, you may notice that they are more expressive with their face (to show happiness, sadness, frustration, etc.) than you are used to, or you may notice that they do not show much expression at all. \n Much communication is non-verbal, no matter what the culture. However, you can focus on the content of what is being said, and ask questions to clarify if you need to. For instance, if someone reacts to something you say with an unexpected smile or laughter, you may need to say “Actually, I'm being I’m serious.” \n If you are communicating with people from another culture and you find they get closer to you or farther away from you than you are used to, it’s not necessarily the case that they are invading your space or trying to avoid you. Just try to follow their cues regarding personal space and communicate as best you can. \n 
 Try some skinny jeans that are coloured light blue,purple, black and have a few pairs of distressed (ripped) skinnies. If you want to wear leggings, have many of them in many different colors. Make sure that you also have lots of sweatpants in different colors. Wear sweats while jogging, hanging out, and sometimes while shopping. For jeans, a couple of must-have styles are cut-offs, and distressed (ripped) jeans. Know that short trousers are a must and that you should have them in all styles. If you really want to wear skirts, make sure that you wear them only occasionally and that you have only a few different skirts in different colours.\n Try some out printed shirts with prints like peace signs. Also wear Band-Fan shirts and hoodies with bands like Rolling Stones, and Metro Station. Remember that some rip-tanks in basic colors like white are acceptable. Wear lots of cardigans as well. \n Make sure that you have mini-dresses in these styles: \n T-Shirt dresses \n One-colored elegant ones \n Printed dresses \n High heels, high heeled sandals, high heeled boots, and flip flops are all essential. \n Punk studded bracelets, long necklaces, necklace with your name on it, Helix earrings, expensive Sunglasses, and expensive purses are most of the accessories that Miley prefers. \n Line the tops of your eyes with black liquid eyeliner three times. Take a pencil eyeliner and line your waterline. Wear some darker shades as opposed to lighter ones. Try some colors like dark purple, black, and dark navy. To make your eyes look bigger and longer, take a black eyeshadow and and smear it on at the very end of the eyes and then smudge the eyeshadow. Also wear mascara on your top and bottom lashes. \n Look at some of Miley's music videos and copy her makeup on them, such as 'The Climb' or 'Party in the USA'. \n Wash out and apply conditioner to the ends of your hair only. \n This will help the look stay in place. \n Try to be very musical and sing everyday. Be diligent about practicing and never miss a day of singing. If you are serious about becoming a good singer, you should consider voice lessons. \n You can practice sounding like Miley Cyrus with easy voice training techniques. Look some up on wikiHow or YouTube for ideas. You can also ask your singing teacher (if you have one) or your school's music teacher for exercises for your voice. \n This way you can practice singing along with the same music Miley has. You can also invest in a karaoke machine or karaoke video game with Miley's songs on it so that you can practice that way if you don't know the lyrics to her songs. \n Work up from there.. \n Watch videos or T.V. programs to see how she performs her songs in different settings. \n Try to learn to emulate both her high-pitched voice and her low-pitched voice like in her song "One In A Million". \n 
 If you are going to be learning in a school environment, you will have to prepare yourself differently than if you are going to be learning by yourself. \n These steps are the general guide to how to learn and study better, but apply specifically to self-learning in your own home or in a quiet place without disturbances. If you come across a situation where some of the steps need to be changed or altered, try bringing the use of these steps back to the home/quiet area environment they were originally intended for. \n Use your best judgement and try to stick as close to these guidelines as possible. If you do, you will ensure your success while learning!\n This can be achieved by understanding where you will be learning, and using past experiences to guide you along the process. \n \n Start off by assessing your body. Are you too cold/warm? Are you tired, stressed, irritated, angry, bored? Take a piece of paper and quickly write down everything that is bothering you or anything that might be a disturbance for you when you are about to learn. If this is in preparation for a school day, try to do this BEFORE you go to school. \n Once you have your list written up, start at the most important problems and fix them, working your way from your biggest problems to your smallest. This should include ANYTHING that might be bothering you because anything, even the smallest of disturbances will affect how well your brain processes information. Your disturbances should fully be taken care of (as in, if you have to go to the bathroom, DO IT! \n If you need sleep and can afford to get more rest, SLEEP! If you have bad breath and that bothers you, BRUSH! If you have little pet peeves that are bothering you, FIX THEM. The more that you have to keep your brain from wandering to the better!!!) \n Now your brain is like a giant camera. Every time you do something, it takes tiny snapshots of the information for later. \n Most of the time your brain is spent processing EVERYTHING equally and taking millions of snapshots per second, by closing what is called synapses, of everything consistently at the same rate. \n What you need to achieve is making your brain focus all, or most, of its snapshots onto your topic of study! If this can be done correctly, you will increase your learning potential by 60%! \n Find a quiet area and remove all disturbances from it. \n If you have a computer on, and it's not the source of learning, turn it off. Make the room as quiet as possible. \n Close the shades and windows so as little light as possible enters the room and then turn on lights to a level that allows you to study your material without squinting or straining AT ALL but while still being dimmer than normal. \n This step is critical to keeping your brain from focusing on your environment. \n When choosing a room, try a place with a comfortable armchair or bed/coach to lie down on. \n A good location is your own bedroom, as long as it is empty of any people and completely quiet. \n A wise monk once said that this was his secret to his studies. \n You must do something calming yet slightly active for exactly 10 minutes. \n Use a stopwatch if it helps to time it right. This calming activity can be anything from taking a shower {don't actually wash yourself, just let the water calm and soothe you), to taking a leisurely stroll around your quiet room, to reading a soothing childrens' book. \n Anything that is slightly active (requires slight concentration) and calming at the same time. Once you have your activity of choice, you will find that doing it over and over will help. \n After your 10 minutes in the shower or some other similar activity, you need to completely relax. \n You can do this by lying down on a bed/coach and concentrating on every muscles and tense point in your body and letting control of that area slip completely away. \n Start at your head and work your way down to your feet. Relax everything, allow yourself to sink into the bed, pretend you have died if that helps. You shouldn't move at all or use any muscle (besides breathing/living of course!). \n Allow all of your senses to become alert, and listen for everything as you slowly find your muscles to be itching as they relax fully for the first time. \n Do this for five minutes and then stop, slowly allowing your muscles to begin working again. Now it's time to drink some water. Your brain may be different but try 32 oz. to begin with. Drink it slowly and calmly and then you will be ready to begin learning. \n Take deep, even, non-conscious breathing and pay no attention to anything around you BUT what you are learning. Read EVERY line, and every important piece of information. You will remember it if you follow these instructions! \n \n Remember, it's a simple concept that your brain is more likely to remember something big and loud than something dull and boring. \n For instance a tiger escapes from the zoo and chooses to chase you. You will most likely remember that event more than the cereal you ate for breakfast less than a week ago. This tiger attack will cause your brain to snap pictures twice as fast and all at once focusing in on the one event. This, by accident, takes all other information in your brain, and saves it along with the memory of the tiger. Without even meaning to, you will probably find, had you really been attacked by a tiger and survived, that you will probably have noticed EVERY detail. \n The trick now is to make your brain think learning your dull and boring topic is as important as remembering how you escaped from that tiger! Don't worry, it's easier done than said in this case! \n Allow yourself to think of important events, or listen to music. Both will allow you to associate yourself with the topic when you hear or think of those things. \n Another good method is to play an action packed video game for 5 minutes. Anything that makes you jumpy, or causes your brain to pick up in speed will cause you to remember better. \n Also, the more you study, the more streamlined you will find your behavior becomes. You will feel more like a machine than a person as you crunch through your work. \n Do this for about 1-2 hours per session, breaking every 15 minutes. After your desired session length if over, don't start the process again for at least 4 hours!!! Your brain needs this time to sort, organize, process, and store this new information! \n You will notice immediately that this will become an easy and efficient routine for you and you should also find that your brain remembers far better than you had ever thought it could. So away with you, and happy learning! \n 
 These teachers and grabbers come in a range of lengths and enable someone to retrieve items from the top shelf of a cupboard or closet, without standing on a chair or to pick up items that are on the floor, without having to get up from the sofa, and can even reach and grab objects that have fallen behind the washing machine. They are easy to use, even for people with arthritis or limited arm and hand movement.\n We know this may seem like a weird idea, but think about it for a while. These cabinet organizers come in a variety of sizes for a variety of uses and would help all older people with storing and retrieving cooking pots and cleaning supplies, without having to get on their hands and knees to try to find something in the back of the cabinet. Of course, someone would have to help with the installation of these, but think how easy it would be for them to find and reach everything. \n Whether your recipient has a vegetable or flower garden these are perfect gift ideas that will allow them to cultivate their garden with little or no concern for the needed tools and with a comfy place to sit while they work. \n With low maintenance and easy set-up anyone can decorate their outdoor and indoor living areas with these cute and whimsical decorations. No tools or ladders are required to display these, making them senior-citizen friendly. Some nursing homes may allow these to be placed outside a resident's window. \n But they are not just for hauling groceries, they are perfect for transporting laundry to the laundry room or outdoors to the clothesline, for hauling groceries from the car to the house, and for moving a pile of stuff from one room to another. \n Even if they do not drive, one of these on the passenger seat belt will make their travels more comfortable by keeping the belt from digging into their neck. While on sheepskin ideas, a sheepskin wheelchair pad is perfect for someone who is wheelchair bound, but these can also be used on a living room chair for extra comfort and warmth. Be forewarned that if they have small pets, the cats and dogs will probably claim the sheepskin pad as their official napping mat! \n Plus, as we get older and wiser there is less and less items that we feel we have to iron. Putting up and taking down those large clumsy ironing boards, just to iron a collar on a shirt, is not easy. \n A fleece blanket is lightweight, easy to fold, easy to wash, and will keep them warm and comfy on those long, lonely winter nights. \n Again, these are great for those who have had to downsize their homes or who can't easily get outside to hang up items on the outdoor clothesline. These lines range from 8 to 40 feet (2.4 to 12.2 m) of drying surface and the units mount in any small space, such as the laundry area, a mudroom, even in the bathtub/shower.
\n We will be messing with it a little bit and you may want to do it. Probably simply using Windows System Restore to create a new restore point before beginning should do it. And that means now! Do it! \n Find the "storage configuration" section and change the SATA mode to your final choice of AHCI or RAID (it should offer three options: IDE, AHCI and RAID). \n If you happened to boot into Windows at this point by mistake, you'll probably get a BSOD and an automatic reboot. Don't despair! It's no big deal. Just move along and choose normal windows boot the next time you'll be loading it... \n It will list all PCI devices you have installed which you'll be able to browse using the PageUp and PageDown keys. If it does not work as expected, try doing the same as root using the following command: sudo lspci -vvnn | less (you'll need to provide the root password). \n Here you may see if the drivers you downloaded match your RAID controller by checking if there's one line in this section has your combination of VENdor and DEVice IDs. Leave this file opened so you can refer to this line. If there is an entry for your IDs, you're good-to-go. Else, you should re-check if your RAID controller is really a SB8xx and if you downloaded the correct drivers. \n You don't have to worry about that, after all you did the registry back-up, right? \n But... If you got again one more BSOD and a reboot, don't fret! Enter BIOS, revert to IDE, boot normally into Windows. \n
 Coins that are made from silver or gold are best, as coins made from nickel and copper will leave stains on your finger. \n When you are first starting out with making coin rings, you should practice with smaller coins, such as nickels, dimes, or pennies. This is just to get the hang of the process. \n Quarters are a highly recommended coin because of their larger size. Look for quarters made prior to 1965, because until that point, quarters were made with 90% silver.Half-dollar coins are also a good option, again because of their size. It is still best to look for half-dollar coins made prior to 1965 due to their high silver makeup.Half-dollars are especially recommended for people with large ring sizes.\n \n A silver coin \n A hammer \n A vise (This is a tool that can be bolted down to a table or work surface. It has a clamp with a rod that can be turned to open and close the grip onto something, like the coins, in this case. It also has an anvil on the side opposite the tightening rod.) \n A ring-sizing mandrel (This is a rod that is wider at one end and tapers down to a smaller point. It is used to size rings.) \n A drill and drill bit (recommended size: 1/8” or 3/16”) \n A handheld rotary tool (A rotary tool is a small, handheld device with a small rod that sticks out of the tip. Different parts can be added to the tip based on what you want to do, like file something down, polish it, et cetera.) \n A carbide cutting bit (This is a particular type of bit used for cutting through metal and can be attached to the rotary tool.) \n Calipers (Similar to a ruler, this is a measuring stick that has moveable arms. The arms are used to measure something, so you expand or narrow them to whatever the object is.) \n Sandpaper (recommended grit: 200-600) \n Felt polishing tip and polishing compound \n Stand it up on an edge so that you can tap the edges with the hammer.You can secure the coin in the grip of the vise to reduce the risk of hammering a finger or thumb in the upcoming steps. However, you will have to stop very frequently to turn the coin in the vise so that you tap all around it evenly. \n You can also grip the coin between your index finger and thumb to keep it in a standing position and prevent it from moving. This can be unsafe, as you run the risk of hammering a finger, so take care. Have an adult do this for you, if you are a youth. \n Lightly tapping is an absolutely essential component of this step.Tapping too hard on the edges causes the coin to become warped, and it is extremely hard to repair that mistake. \n Try to avoid tapping the same spot on the coin repeatedly, so as to avoid making one edge of the ring too flat.Rotate the coin slightly with every tap. You can gently turn it toward you or away from you as you go. \n After about 10 minutes of tapping, you should observe that the reeded edge (i.e. the lined edge) has started to flatten. Eventually, those reedings should disappear altogether., This could take up to two hours, so prepare yourself for this time-consuming process.Eventually, the text on the edge of the coin should start to wrap around what will soon become the inside of the ring. \n The coin should continue to shrink in diameter while the band of the ring continues to flatten and widen from the tapping. \n Half-dollar coins take even more time to tap, as they are larger than a quarter, so keep this in mind when you choose your coin. \n Despite tapping lightly, it is possible that the coin could start to warp a bit. Be sure to check for warping periodically so that you can correct it early.Lay the coin down flat on the vise. Bend down to the coin's level and check for space between the coin and the surface. You can correct very minor warping with sanding later, or you can try corrective tapping to amend the warp if it is a bit bigger. \n Use your calipers to measure the inside diameter of the coin, but before you go too far with tapping down the edges, be sure you know what ring size you want the coin to become.14.1 mm = size 3 \n 14.5 mm = size 3 ½ \n 14.9 mm = size 4 \n 15.3 mm = size 4 ½ \n 15.7 mm = size 5 \n 16.1 mm = size 5 ½ \n 16.5 mm = size 6 \n 16.9 mm = size 6 ½ \n 17.3 mm = size 7 \n 17.7 mm = size 7 ½ \n 18.1 mm = size 8 \n 18.5 mm = size 8 ½ \n This refers to the outer edges of the band curving down slightly.Stand the coin on the flat surface of the vise again and lean it at about a 75-degree angle. Lightly tap the edges as you did before, except this time, tap them down toward the center of the ring. Remember to rotate as you tap to avoid tapping the same spot consecutively. \n Flip the coin to its other side and repeat. \n Check that the curvature is uniform by holding the holding the coin upright and rotating it in your fingers, focusing on the curvature all the way around. \n Before moving any further in the development, it is important to stop and smooth the outer edges of the coin from any waviness or warping.Use a 200-220 grit sandpaper, and lay it on a flat surface. Then, lay the coin flat on one side on the sandpaper, and gently move it in a circular motion to soften the edges. Avoid taking too much off the edges because you will start to lose some of the text and other features of the coin. Then, flip the coin to its other side and repeat. \n The towel protects the edges of the ring from the vise. The coin should be flat, as if it is laid on its side, not standing up.Take care to grip the vise tight enough to hold the coin in place but not so tight as to cause warping. \n Be sure to push all the way through the ring, taking care not to push so hard that the coin slips out of the vise.Use a drill bit size that is compatible with your carbide cutting bit. The suggested sizes are listed in Step 2. \n Run the rotary tool at a high speed so that it cuts out the middle smoothly and cleanly.Be very careful with this step and pay much attention while you are doing it. If the cutting bit slips out, it could damage the inside of the ring in the process, causing you to lose some of the coin face and text that make it so unique. \n As you get close to the edges of the ring, slow the rotary tool a bit.Rotate the ring inside the vise to ensure an even circular diameter inside the ring. \n Occasionally take out the ring and check its size on the ring-sizing mandrel. If you do not have a mandrel, then try it on your own finger. \n By now, there is likely a sharp edge at the transition where the half round starts, so take time to sand it down.Slip the ring over the tip of your index finger and begin sanding the transition at the half round. Start out with 200-220 grit sandpaper and work your way up to about 600 grit sandpaper. \n The more sanding you do now, with finer grit sandpaper, the less polishing that needs to be done on the band of the ring. \n Do not sand inside the ring, as you will lose the details of the coin face and text. \n This frees up an edge of the ring for polishing without having to hold it.Rub polishing compound on the ring with a paper towel. This prepares you to polish it with the polishing tip. \n Hold the rotary tool so that the sides of the felt polishing tip rub against the ring.Rotate the ring occasionally so that you polish all the way around it. You will have to continue to apply polishing compound as you reach new sections of the ring. \n Polish until you remove all of the sanding lines and the ring is extremely shiny. \n Now you can polish the inside of the ring.Apply polishing compound inside the ring, and then polish it with the rotary tool and felt polishing tip. \n Remember to put the grip tight enough to hold the ring but not so tight as to warp it. \n DIY rings are a bit more susceptible to scratches, so taking the time to polish it every couple of months will keep it in good shape. \n

 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) steel plate with bracing will enable you to bend 14 gauge galvanized steel sheet metal in lengths up to about 3 feet (0.9 m), which is the size and specification for the project described in this article. Here are some materials used to build this particular brake. \n 1/4 cold rolled steel plate, one piece 7"X42", one 14"X48" \n 1/4"X2" angle iron, two pieces 14", one piece 42", one piece 48" \n 5/16"X2 1/2" angle iron 42" long \n 1 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) steel tubing, about 18" long \n 1/2"X1 1/2" steel bolts with nuts and washers, 4 each. \n 1/2"X1 1/2" smooth steel rods, 2 required\n Lay the 14" wide plate on saw horses or a workbench so the remaining pieces can be fitted. \n Clamp these if desire to prevent them from shifting during the next steps. \n These will act as the clamping hinges when the brake is assembled. \n This will stiffen the plate when a piece of metal is clamped in the brake. \n The location of these bolts isn't critical, but it will look better if they are in line with each other and on each end. Install one of your 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) bolts into each hole, bolting the angle to the plate loosely. \n The exact location of these will be determined by the alignment of the brake, as you will find later, but you should be able to center your 1/2 rods in the center of the corner of the angle. \n These are the sockets the hinge pins will fit into. \n Keep it as straight as possible to the corner of the angle iron so it can swivel freely when it is installed. \n Center it on that angle, and weld it into position. \n
 A coffee can, particularly a three-pound coffee can, or a gallon commercial food can would be perfect. Width is particularly important if you want to use a cooking vessel on your can rather than just grill on it.\n \n If your stove has a bottom, you can load it with fuel and then set it in its final position. If your stove has no bottom, you'll have to load it in its final position or set it over a stack of fire materials on the ground, and not shift it as you add fuel. \n If your stove has a top, you can cook on it directly as a grill, and soot will not accumulate as heavily on cookware. If your stove has no top, it will be more efficient with pots, pans and other cooking vessels because the hot gases will touch them directly and not be insulated by an air gap. You can also warm yourself near it with the top off; it should radiate more efficiently though less powerfully than an open fire because it is not cooled by an excessive amount of air pulled in at the bottom. (Don't burn yourself or expose your face to the rising smoke, which might contain sparks from time to time.) \n If you want your stove to have a bottom and a top, find one that has a solid bottom and top, not a peel-off top like some coffee cans, and remove its original contents not by opening an end, but by punching a hole in the side near an end (which is easiest if the original contents are liquid or granular). This hole will be enlarged to form the fuel door. Choosing which end to make the hole near, designating it as the bottom, follows. \n Leave no flammable paper or glue on the can. (These would burn or scorch on the first use; a little residue is fine.) Make sure that the can has one end intact, and one end completely gone (unless you're making a stove with a top and a bottom). If necessary, finish removing one end with a can opener. Use the more-common kind of can opener which leaves a smooth can rim and a sharp removed lid, not the kind which leaves the rolled lip on the lid and makes the can sharp. \n A nice finishing touch would be to extend the cuts for this a little past the hole, and roll the edges in and back flush a fraction of the inch to reduce sharp edges (use a pliers). \n If you're making a stove with a top, open at the bottom: Turn the can upside down, so that the open end is down. Cut a rectangle out of the can, cutting through the rim. Detach and discard the rectangle. \n If you're making a stove with a bottom, open at the top: Make the hole at or very close to the bottom. Use a nail (a big framing nail) or punch to make starting hole(s), then finish cutting with a tinsnips, diagonal cutters, or similar. \n If you're making a stove with a bottom and a top: Proceed as with making a stove with a bottom, after deciding which end you want to be the bottom of the stove (and draining the contents through a hole you made near it). If you make the end with the rim (normally the top of a can) the bottom, then the top will be rimless and seamless, which could be nice for grilling. If you make the end without the rim (normally the bottom of a can) the bottom, then the top will have a rim, which would be nice for cooking with smaller cans (though that practice is inefficient; use a topless stove with a cooking vessel). \n Turn the can around to the side opposite your rectangle. In the upper half near the closed top of your stove/can, punch lots of holes, using a hammer and fairly large nail. Brace the can securely somewhere that does not involve your hands (such as against a concrete step, driving diagonally into it). Make as many holes as will fit about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch apart, in that top half of the back of your stove. If you're making a can without a top, avoid distorting the can by pounding into it. You might support the can on something inanimate and sturdy, such as a log, extended into it so that it doesn't tend to flatten. \n One kind could be a few parallel metal rods, such as coat-hanger pieces, passed through holes at a given level a little below the top and bent over at the ends so they stay in place.A very efficient design, although complicated to make, might have a bottom, and a top in which a hole is cut to wrap around a smaller can/cooking vessel, which is supported off the fire but not quite at the top of the big can so that it is surrounded by hot smoke, whose heat it has a large area and long time to conduct. If you make something like this, be sure to roll the sharp edges. \n Build the fire on a piece of ground with no grass or other flammable material. Clear a space around the fire as well. There should be nothing but dirt in the vicinity of your fire. Gather a supply of twigs to feed your fire. Then, once the fire is going, place your stove over the fire. The rectangle gives you an entrance to blow on the fire or to feed it twigs, while smoke should escape through the holes in the back. \n When they steam off, try frying an egg or heating up something on the surface of your stove. \n These stoves are top-heavy so don't boil a large quantity, use a tall vessel, or one with a long handle to reduce the risk of it falling over and of burns if it does fall over. A slightly-wider can, whose corrugated bottom will tend to make it stay put, or a pan with a curved or rough bottom would be good. \n If you put in supports, set a small can on the supports. \n It will probably mark and may cause surface damage to cookware. Don't use fancy pots and pans. Consequently, the heat will not be evened out by the cookware. At least at first, don't try to make thick soups or other things prone to scorching. \n 
 Fill a large pot roughly halfway with water and bring it to a boil on the stove over high heat. \n The stockpot should contain enough water to completely cover the head of cabbage. Do not overfill the pot, however, since doing so can cause the water to boil over the side. \n You do not need to add any salt or oil to the water.\n Cut away as much of the core as you can and remove any torn or ragged outer leaves. \n Cut around the core at the bottom of the cabbage head using a small paring knife. Dig as much of the core out as possible. Doing this makes it easier to remove the leaves after the cabbage boils. \n Place the cabbage in the boiling water and cook for roughly 2 minutes. \n Carefully dunk the cabbage in and out of the boiling water using tongs or a heat-resistant serving spoon. \n Keep the cabbage core-end-up as it boils. \n The leaves should soften and start to break free once the cabbage has boiled for a sufficient amount of time. \n Once the cabbage is cool enough to handle with your hands, remove 12 leaves from the outside of the cabbage, keeping them intact as much as possible. \n As long as you cut away a portion of the core before boiling the cabbage, the leaves should practically fall off on their own. If this does not happen, though, you can use a fork or tongs to gently loosen the leaves. \n As you pull away the leaves, do so gently so that you do not accidentally rip them. \n Use a paring knife to cut a V-shaped cut from the bottom of each leaf around the thick center rib to remove it. \n Only cut out the thickest part of this center rib, located at the bottom of the stem. Do not cut too far into the leaf. If you do, wrapping the leaf around the filling will become difficult. \n This is only an optional step and is not absolutely essential. If you are uncertain about how much to trim and are anxious about trimming away too much, you could simply skip this step. \n Set aside. \n For a chunkier sauce, you could use an undrained 15-oz (470-ml) can of diced tomatoes and 1 cup (250 ml) of tomato sauce instead of the 15-oz (470-ml) can of tomato sauce. \n Place the ground beef, ground pork, tomato sauce, chopped onion, uncooked rice, parsley, salt, pepper, and paprika in a large mixing bowl and mix the ingredients with your hands until thoroughly combined. \n Make sure that your hands are clean before you mix the filling. On a similar note, make sure that you wash your hands with warm water and soap after handling raw meat. \n You could use a wooden or plastic mixing spoon instead of your hands, but it may be more difficult to combine the ingredients evenly using that technique. \n Place roughly 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the mixture in each leaf, toward the center bottom. \n If you cut away a portion of the center vein, place the filling just above the removed portion. \n Beginning from the cut end of the leaf, roll each leaf up and over the filling, tucking the leaf underneath itself to create a tight bundle. \n If you cut away a portion of the center vein, overlap the cut ends before you begin rolling the leaf up. Otherwise, you may not be able to create an even roll and the filling could start to fall out. \n Fold the open ends of each leaf underneath the bundle to prevent the roll from unraveling. \n The bottom of the roll should be the edge at which you stopped rolling. In other words, no seams should be visible from the “top” of the cabbage roll. \n Hold each roll together with a toothpick, if necessary. If the roll comes loose or spills open, re-wrap it and secure the ends in place by spearing the roll with a toothpick. \n \n A Dutch oven or roasting pan is ideal because of the size and weight of the pan, but you could also use a casserole dish or large baking dish in a pinch. \n Spoon the sauce onto the bottom of the pan and spread it out evenly. \n The sauce helps to prevent the cabbage rolls from sticking to the bottom of the pan. As such, you do not need to use aluminum foil or cooking spray. \n Place the cabbage rolls seam-side-down on the sauce-covered pan bottom, keeping them in a single layer. \n The cabbage rolls will likely fit into the pan rather snugly, but that is not a problem. If anything, the snug fit will help the rolls keep their shape as they bake. \n It is, however, important that the rolls be kept on a single layer. If not, they may not cook evenly. \n Cover the rolls as evenly as possible. \n If necessary, use a spoon or spatula to spread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll. Some of the sauce can also slide down into the spaces between the rolls. \n Cover the pan and bake the rolls until become tender. \n Check the cabbage rolls after the first 60 minutes. If the cabbage leaves still do not feel tender, continue baking for the additional 30 minutes. \n Make sure that the cover you are using is oven-safe. This is especially important if you are using a baking pan instead of a Dutch oven. If you do not have a lid, cover the pan with aluminum foil. \n The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the oven. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving. \n A standard serving size is two rolls per person. \n Spoon the sauce onto the bottom of the pan and spread it out evenly. \n The sauce partially prevents the cabbage rolls from sticking to the bottom of the Dutch oven. As a result, you do not need to use cooking spray. \n Place the cabbage rolls seam-side-down on the sauce-covered pan bottom, keeping them in a single layer. \n The cabbage rolls will fit into the Dutch oven rather snugly. This snug fit will help the rolls keep their shape as they cook. \n It is important, however, to keep the cabbage rolls in a single layer inside the Dutch oven. If not, they may not cook evenly. \n Cover the rolls as evenly as possible. \n If necessary, spread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll by using the back of a spoon or a flat spatula. Some of the sauce should also slide down into the gaps between the cabbage rolls. \n Cover the pan and cook on the lowest heat possible until the rolls become tender. \n If you cook the cabbage rolls at too high a heat or for too long, the bottoms may burn and stick to the Dutch oven. \n The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the stove. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving. \n A standard serving size is two rolls per person. \n Place the rolls in your slow cooker, seam-side-down, packing them in tightly and in even layers. \n Ideally, the cabbage rolls should be packed into a single layer. This is not always possible with a slow cooker, though, and not even essential. Since the majority of the cooking depends on the steam and heat built up inside the slow cooker as it cooks, the rolls do not need to be packed into one layer to cook evenly. \n Evenly spread the sauce out over the contents of the slow cooker. \n Spread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll by using the back of a spoon or a flat spatula. \n Make sure that some of the sauce seeps into the cracks and crevices between the cabbage rolls. This is especially important if some of the cabbage rolls are layered on top of others. \n \n Do not remove the cover from the slow cooker at any point during the cooking process. \n If you are running a bit short on time, cook the cabbage rolls on High for about 4 hours. \n The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the slow cooker. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving. \n A standard serving size is two rolls per person. \n 
 Write down a few of the things that you like to do for fun. Next, write down a few items that you'd use for that hobby. Choose the ones you really like from that list, and add them to your wish list. Here are some ideas to get you started: \n If you like to paint or draw, you might need some new graphite pencils, paintbrushes, or paints. If you do oil painting, you might also need some linseed oil or turpentine.

This could be a sports game, a concert, or even a theme park. Click here for more gift ideas based on experiences. \n Sometimes, figuring out what you need is easier than deciding what you want. Think about the past few months. Ask yourself if there was something you really needed at one point but didn't have. Here are some things to get you started: \n If you cook a lot, you might find that some of your pots, pans, and other utensils need replacing or updating. You could ask for a new set or blender. If all your cooking gear is in top condition, consider some exotic spices instead. If you have a green thumb, you might like a grow-your-own herb kit. You'll get some pots, soil, and a few popular cooking herbs, such as basil, thyme, and mint. \n If you play a sport or music, see if your gear needs updating or replacing. Equipment can be expensive, and a birthday is a great chance to get an upgrade. \n If your birthday is close to winter, it might be a good idea to check and see if your winter clothes still fit. If they don't, you could ask for a new jacket or scarf. \n Do you have a favorite store that you like to shop in? Visit their website and see if there is anything new that came out since the last time you visited. Sometimes, walking through a store, thumbing through a catalog, or surfing the web may give you some ideas. \n If you have a free weekend, try visiting your local mall. Be sure to take note of anything that interests you. \n Chances are, you might be interested in more than one thing, such as drawing, painting, and knitting. You might also find yourself wanting anything and everything related to your craft. This could easily get overwhelming. To keep this from happening, you could always ask for a set or kit. They usually contain everything you need to complete a project or two. This would also make it easier on your friends and family when they go gift-shopping; they won't have to worry about getting the right supplies or missing an important one. Here are some ideas to get you started: \n If you like beading, you might like a beading set. Most will have everything you need to create a necklace, a pair of earrings, and a bracelet. They will come with beading wire, clasps and crimps, and beads. You might also be interested in getting some polymer clay so that you can make your own beads. \n If you are into DIY, you might like a soap or candle-making kit. You could also ask for supplies for a basic DIY project, such as chalkboard paint, mason jars, burlap, twine, and paint brushes. \n If you like to draw, you could ask for a set of graphite or charcoal pencils, a sketchbook, and a how-to-draw book. These books come on just about every subject, from people to plants and trees to animals. Some even focus on specific animals, such as birds, cats, dogs, or horses. If you like fantasy creatures, then there are books on how to draw mermaids, fairies, elves, and dragons. There are even books on how to draw anime. \n If you like to paint, consider an art set. Many arts and crafts stores sell sets that come in wooden or metal cases. You can get them with artist-grade acrylic, oil, or watercolor paints. Some sets may also including a how-to-paint book, some art paper, or a canvas. \n If you like knitting or crochet, you don't have to limit yourself to just plain old yarn. You would treat yourself to some fancier, more expensive yarn with different fibers and textures. There are also many pattern books available that you might like as well. \n Things like computers, phones, and tablets are always updating, and what is new one year will be old and outdated the next. Accessories, such as cases and earphones, however, won't get old as fast and could last you much longer. Here are some ideas: \n If you have a phone or tablet, ask for a protective case. They can often be personalized with your name, a design, or an image. \n Headphones, speakers and other smaller items can enhance a device you already have. \n You might also like something nostalgic, such as a new turntable to play your record collection. \n Jewelry can be expensive, but it doesn't have to be. You can get many beautiful, handmade pieces on artist websites, such as Etsy, and at craft fairs. Look through your jewelry collection and see if there anything you wish you to complete an outfit, such as a brooch, bracelet, or necklace. If jewelry isn't your thing, you could always ask for a special hat or bag. Here's a few more ideas for you: \n When asking for jewelry, consider getting a full set: a necklace and matching earrings. \n If you already have a lot of jewelry but nothing to keep it in, you could ask for a jewelry box instead. \n If you are a man, you can always ask for a tie pin, cuff-links, or even a new watch. \n Belts and wallets can make great gifts. If you get them in leather, you might be able to get them customized; some leather can be stamped with a design or letters. \n Just be sure to list your favorite colors, shades, and scents as these can be personal. Like jewelry, makeup does not take up a lot of space, and it can be used almost very day. Here are some ideas to get you started: \n Many makeup companies offer gift sets that include a makeup bag, eye shadow, lipstick, and blush. \n Bath and beauty stores often offer gift baskets that include lotion and soap. Some even include things like bath bombs, salts, and bubbles. \n If you like to use expensive moisturizers or perfumes, your birthday is a great chance to ask for these. \n Most sports teams have online gift shops. They are a great place to start looking. If your favorite team is playing near your town around your birthday, see if you can get a ticket to their game. Here are some more ideas: \n Ask for jersey, hat, or sweatshirt that you can wear to games to show your support. \n If you want to show your support in the workplace, try searching for business-appropriate attire instead, such as: a necktie, socks, cuff-links, or a scarf. \n If you like to host parties to watch, ask for things like a themed bowl. They could add a personal touch to your party. \n You could also ask for items that would allow you to play a sport, such as athletic apparel, specialized shoes, rackets, or balls. \n If you have a favorite author or genre, ask for the latest book in a series. The New York Times bestseller list can help you find the most popular books in a variety of genres. Let the giver know what your tastes. Maybe he or she has read something you would enjoy. Here are some more ideas: \n Ask for an e-reader; this will allow you to carry all your favorite books, wherever you go. \n If you already own an e-reader, ask for a special cover for your reader. You can also ask for a gift certificate so that you can buy more e-books. \n If you have a favorite book, see if you can find a canvas book bag or a poster that features the cover. You might even find a print of the book cover on a shirt, mug, or even mouse pad. \n If you have a favorite quote about reading or from a favorite author, look online to see if it is available on a poster, mug or other object. \n If you already own a few figures from a certain set, ask for more figures so that you can finish your collection. If you like playing games, you might like board games or card games like Uno, Clue, or Apples to Apples. \n Older players may enjoy strategy games like Ticket to Ride, or parlor games like Cards Against Humanity. \n You might also be interested in model kits. Some are simple, and only require you to snap together the parts. There is no glue or painting involved. Some kits are more advanced; you have to glue the parts together and paint them. You can buy models kits of cars, airplanes, ships, helicopters, and motorcycles. You could even buy space ships from popular science fiction films, such as Star Wars and Star Trek. \n If you like a show, book series, or video game, you could ask for merchandise from that. For example, you could ask for a wand from Harry Potter, a figure or model from Lord of the Rings or a t-shirt from your favorite video game. You might also want to add to your collection of DVDs or books. Here are a few more ideas: \n Fans of video games may enjoy a Minecraft backpack or pajamas with the Crest of Hyrule from the Legend of Zelda. \n If you like to cosplay, you could ask for a wig or accessories to finish your latest work.

The person might even be flattered that you think their talents are gift-worthy. Handmade gifts are both unique and special, and sure to stand out. Here are some things you could ask for: \n If you know someone who likes to knit, see if they are willing to make you a scarf or hat. \n If you know someone who sews, see if they might be willing to make you a new bag. \n If one of your friends likes to make soaps or candles, see if they could make you a set. \n Sometimes, your favorite store may not be carrying something that you like at the moment. A gift card will allow you to set money aside to spend at that store when you do find something that you like. \n Some people do not like giving gift cards. If this happens, ask them if they could go with you to the store to buy that special gift when the time comes. \n If the budget is large, you might ask to go on a trip to a place you’ve never been to. If the budget is more limited, ask to spend a day with the giver. It can be as simple as going out to a meal or to a museum in your town. Here's some more ideas: \n Visit another country or state you have always wanted to go to. If you don't know where to go, you could always close your eyes and point to a spot on a map. Open your eyes, and visit wherever your finger is pointing to. \n Go on a cruise. Oftentimes, cruises also allow you to go on land and tour; you are not always stuck on a boat. \n Go to the park. It can be as simple as your local neighborhood park. It can also be a state or national park. \n Go camping. Keep in mind that it is not a good idea to go camping alone, so you might want to bring a buddy or two. \n Much like traveling, these sorts of experiences need some planning. In many cases, they will also need some equipment as well. They can, however, be combined with traveling. For example, if you go to a tropical island, you might also want to try scuba diving. If you decide to go camping, you might also want to try visiting some caves or go hiking. Here's some more ideas for you to consider: \n Bungee jumping \n Caving \n Hiking or backpacking \n Horseback riding \n Kayaking \n Rock climbing \n Scuba diving \n Many spas offer extra-special treatments, such as fancy pedicures complete with salts, oils, and an extra long massage. If you don't like pedicures, you might like a massage or a facial with a mud mask. Be sure to schedule your appointment in advance, as some of the more popular spa centers get their spots filled up fast. \n Many businesses offer gift certificates to learn a new skill, such as dancing, martial arts, painting, or woodworking. You can also see if you can spend the day learning a special skill from a family member. Your grandmother may be delighted to teach you how to bake a cake or cook a favorite dish. And the best part is that you can eat what you cook after you are done. Here are some more ideas: \n If you like beading, cake decorating, crochet, knitting, or painting, visit an arts and crafts store. Many of them offer classes in these areas. \n Some community centers also offer classes in areas such as pottery, weaving, and music. \n They are great gifts for those who enjoy art or history. Many museums are themed, and focus on a certain type of history (such as ancient Egyptian or Medieval) or a certain type of art (such as Asian or French Impressionist). Think about what interests you, and see if there is a museum that features your interests. \n If history or art aren't your think, you might be interested in a sports or music hall of fame. You might also enjoy visiting a wax museum or a museum that focuses on technology and innovation. \n Most of the time, you only have to pay an entrance fee, and can spend as much time as you want. Some zoos and aquariums may allow you to get up close and personal with some of the animals for an additional fee. If you are interested in this, visit your local zoo or aquarium's website, and see if this is an option. \n Sometimes, the memories of an event can outlast any physical gift. Many theaters and concert halls may also have gift shops that sell posters, CDs, and shirts that you can buy to help you remember the experience even more. \n See if your favorite band is playing close to you, and ask for a ticket to their concert. You can make the experience even more special by asking for a VIP pass, so that you can meet your favorite band members and have them sign items for you. \n If you like classical music, you might be interested in attending a concert with a live orchestra. \n If you like singing and dancing, you might enjoy watching a musical. If you like performing arts, but without the singing or dancing, try a play instead. \n Keep in mind, however, that if this convention is out of town, and if you will be staying there overnight, you may need a place to stay there. Many hotels that host the conventions offer special prices on rooms. \n If anime or comic books aren't your think, you might be interested in a Renaissance Faire instead. They are usually open only on weekends, so you do not need to stay there overnight. They are a great way to immerse yourself in history and fantasy. \n If you have a favorite author or illustrator, see if he or she is holding a reading or signing in your area. Not only will you be able to meet someone you adore, but you may also walk away with an autograph. \n An experience doesn't always have to be active. It can also be as simple as enjoying good food with friends and family. Choose a restaurant that you love, or that you have always wanted to go to. \n Sometimes, the gift of giving may feel more rewarding than the gift of receiving. Think about some things that you are passionate about, and try to find an organization that supports that. Here are some ideas: \n Animals and nature \n The homeless \n Disaster relief \n Education \n If you can't decide between a few items, make a pro and con list. Write down the good things and the bad things about each item on your list. Choose the item that has the most advantages and the fewest disadvantages. For example, a jacket may not be very exciting, but you could wear it with many different outfits; it may also keep you warm in the wintertime. \n It might be school, a job, sports, or something else entirely. If playing sports are the most important thing for you, new equipment might be more useful than that new video game—which you may not have the time to play between practices. \n Sometimes, what you want right now may not be what you will want (or use) later on down the road. If you can't decide between a few items, try to imagine your life without each of those items a few months later. Choose the item that you will continue to use, or still be interested in, over those whose novelty will fade. \n You can also try imagining what it would be like not to get one of these gifts. Choose the one you'd be most upset over not getting. \n Not everyone might be able to spend a lot of money on a gift. If you want something very expensive, try asking the person for a budget before posting your wish list. If you ask for something that the person is unable to afford, he or she might feel embarrassed. Here are some other options: \n If you are too shy to ask for a budget, put a few expensive and inexpensive things on your wish list. This will let people buy what is within their budget. \n Ask for a group gift. This will allow everyone in your family or circle of friends to chip in when the time comes to buy that expensive gift. \n Ask for a gift that doubles up for another occasion. For example, if your birthday is in the winter, you could ask for a gift that is both a birthday and Christmas present \n Offer to pay for part of it yourself. The combination of your money and theirs may allow you to get something expensive that you really want. \n If you cannot decide between two or three things, ask someone else to choose for you. Give that person the list, and tell him or her to choose one item from that list. Some people may even prefer being able to choose a gift for you. \n If you try to meet other people's expectations, you will end up getting stressed. You may also end up not getting something that you really wanted.If the trip to the beach is what would really make you happy, let your family know. You do not have to choose an expensive gift for your birthday, just because all your friends do on theirs. \n 
,  This will be the tail.,  This marks where the legs will be.,  This step is very simple. The Y-shapes show where the talons will be when you draw the legs. Make sure they are at each end of the line across the tail., The beginning of the leg is a circular shape that sends halfway down the line that leads to the Y-shapes. Use the remaining space between the circles and the y-shapes for the lower legs. then you can draw the talons using the Y-shapes to guide where they will be and how long the "toes" are.,  These are Yveltal's "Fingers.",  Add three spikes to the underside of the wings near the body.  These spikes are more akin to feathers.,  Draw a short curve from the body towards the right wing.  Then add another curve under it to make it Yveltal's neck. These lines will be connected later when making Yveltal's head. Attempt to follow the sample above to avoid proportion problems.,  Add triangles to the rectangles to make Yveltal's horns.(The horns are the rectangles+the triangles.)  You can finish its face by drawing the beak with a downwards zigzag and connect it to the lower line that makes Yveltal's neck., Draw a curve from the tip of the triangle on Yveltal's chest to the top of the page.  Bring the same curve back down to the other side.  Reconnect this curve to the chest using these lines. This is should vaguely resemble a triangular shape. Be as free handed as you like when drawing Yveltal's mane, as the actual curves in the plumes are variable. Be sure to add feather spikes here and there to give a ruffled, unruly look., These are branch-like structures, so make them as harsh and jagged as you like. Ensure, however, that at the end of each limb, the branch splits into three., After that, your destruction bird is ready.
 To be even more annoying, sit next to other diners. If they ask you what you are doing, simply reply, "Seating myself." Stay until someone has the guts to ask you to leave. \n Seat yourself at a table that's already been reserved. \n If you're unable to seat yourself, let the hostess seat you and feel free to tell everyone you don't like where you're seated.\n (or waiter) incessantly. Always make up some wild complaint when attended to, such as, "There's an odd number of ice cubes in my water!" \n Also, try snapping your fingers to get the waiter's/waitresses attention. \n For bonus points, poke at the waitstaff to get their attention using your fork (but don't stab people). \n Foodies are infamous for \n Playing 20 questions with the server. \n Criticizing-no, wait-critiquing everything that's been served to them. \n Making moaning sex noises like you are really into that sex while eating. \n Being persnickety with the food. \n Monopolizing the wait-staff's time. \n \n The nanny you're going to fire. \n Complain that you will never get laid. \n This works best at a crowded restaurant and you want the best seat in the house at the last minute (with no reservation). This lets everyone know you demand preferential treatment. \n If you're in an Italian restaurant, order sushi. \n very loudly. See if anyone reacts. \n \n free drinks) request 100 free drinks. See if you have to pay for them. \n Spill your water on your table and declare in a whiny pre-school voice, "I want another water!" \n \n Make sure the music is loud! \n May I try a bite?" \n 
 \n Look through old family papers and photos for copies of obituaries, funeral records, or other records that might give you a clue about where to start \n Read back issues of newspapers searching obituaries or funeral notices. They often list the cemetery name and location. Funeral home records may also provide information on burial sites. Sometimes the records of funeral homes no longer in existence have been preserved at a local museum or library. \n Check with the temple, church, or mosque for interment information if you know your ancestors' religion. Find out if they belonged to any Lodge or Military Groups that included in membership, a burial cemetery. They typically keep this information forever. \n Look at a map of the cemeteries nearby your ancestors' place of residence. People tended to be buried within a few miles of their home, especially in times before cars and trucks were so abundant. \n \n See if there is a grounds keeper's office on the grounds of the specific cemetery that you know your ancestors are buried in. While they will not do research for you, they often have plot records sorted alphabetically or by year, which can assist you locate the graves you are searching for. \n These are helpful to both identify the correct places to look and to guide you to the proper grave site. The library in the locality where you are searching may have information on how to contact the appropriate local organizations or may be able to tell you if they have a copy of any published works. \n Graves are typically mixed rather than being arranged by year of burial, so you will have to look at every one to identify names. Be prepared to consider misspellings of family names — standardized spelling is a fairly recent phenomenon. \n If not, you may want to consider wearing boots or other protective clothing. \n Little details can sometimes prove useful later. \n Note the branch of service or event it commemorates as this information can be used to learn more about your ancestor later. \n Also consider purchasing an inexpensive GPS device so that you can record your exact location for each photograph taken. This will make it easier for you or others to find the grave again in the future (this may be harder than you think!). \n Since gravestones come in a variety of interesting shapes and sizes, such photos will help to orient future searchers. \n photograph and record the information on the graves immediately surrounding your family's stones. They may be relatives you have not yet found in your research. This will save you research time and a return visit to the graveyard once you do find the names. \n Take a photo of the stone with the shaving cream on it as well. If the stone contains writing in a language you do not understand, copy down as much as you can, and take several close up photos. Arrange to have them translated later, as they may give you additional information. However, keep in mind that many people believe that shaving cream may harm the gravestone. Consider using water and a soft brush to clear up the inscription. Using a spotlight or changing camera angle may help the inscription "pop." If you decide to use water, remember to dry the gravestone. Never put any wax on a gravestone; it will keep water inside the gravestone. \n In many cultures, this would be flowers. In a Jewish cemetery, a single stone is placed on the top of each visited grave. Before leaving, walk around and see if other family names are in the same cemetery. People who lived near each other are often buried in the same graveyard. \n Copy them over when you get home if needed, making sure that dates and spellings are transcribed accurately. \n 
 \n Carry plenty of business cards with you at all times, and politely offer one at the close of a good conversation or meeting with a new contact.\n As a successful rainmaker, appearance is important, and dressing appropriately shows respect and inspires trust. \n Be a current member of local, national and international trade organizations to build your network of business associates and potential clients. \n Convince them that your service or product is better than the competition's. \n Remember to give extra service in order to please each customer.

Then work the look around how you're feeling and it'll come more naturally. \n Always make sure you have the basics (such as jeans and T-shirts), but keep it causal. Items like flowing tank tops, boho dresses (especially maxi), flowing skirts, lightweight sweaters can spice up your carefree style and add some diversity. \n Girls:Go for natural looking beach waves, messy buns or tousled plaits/braids. To make a hairstyle look prettier while still remaining effortless, add a hair accessory, invest in some flowers, hippie-style hairbands, or jeweled headbands. Boys: The "just out of bed" look has always been hot, so invest in some wax and ruffle your hair up a bit. In the summer, it's better to have your hair a little longer than you'd normally have it. \n A popular trend with both girls and fellas in the summer is braided bracelets which are never taken off. Don't worry about them getting tatty, they still look good that way. Guys should go for neutral colours like brown, beige, black and grey, whereas girls can be more creative and get colorful ones, with things such as beads on them. Permanent shell necklaces can also add carefree flair. \n The more time you spend outside doing things, the more energetic you'll be, the more you'll enjoy your summer, and the better your tan will be. Try skateboarding, rollerblading, tennis, swimming... your options are endless. Make sure that you try a few things out, and go with what you enjoy, not what other people do. Others will like you more if you show independence rather than copying what other people do. \n To make them a bit cooler, go for cut off styles. These are really easy to make yourself from a pair of old jeans if you cut the legs off and pull on the threads to create a raw edge. If you have short but slim legs then go for tight fitting ones which follow the curve of your leg, if your legs are a bit wider then choose looser fitting shorts which open up slightly at the thigh. Tall, slim girls can look good in most styles of shorts. A particularly popular trend with shorts this year is the high-waisted type, and these often go well with a mid-rift length top. Denim skirts are also an option.\n They mix together summery hippy styles with beautiful femininity, but all with minimum effort. If you have a large frame then choose one that pinches in at the waist, or one that could be pinched in with a belt to avoid looking like a tent. Wearing a V neckline will make someone look slimmer, a round neckline will hold bigger breasts more easily. Experiment with different prints, and find something that looks gorgeous on you. \n Reach for a denim jacket. Fairly affordable, timeless and go with any outfit. Denim in general makes an outfit look relaxed and casual, so why only wear it on jeans? Wearing it as a jacket makes it a bit more interesting. A light shade of denim is more suited for summer. Try wearing one over a maxi dress or a floral top. As a lighter alternative to a denim jacket, look for a denim-style shirt and try wearing that, unbuttoned, over an outfit. Denim shirts look best a size too big. It's usually best to only wear one item of denim clothing at a time, so don't wear a denim top and jeans at the same time. \n Floral prints are everywhere in summer, on shorts, skirts, dresses, shoes, baggy tops and bags. If you're not a very girly girl then go for floral accessories such as earrings, bags and shoes rather than a floral clothing to keep it minimal. Try not to wear too many flower prints at one time, otherwise you'll look like an accident in a florist. This fits in with the previous trends mentioned, try a floral print maxi dress, or a short tie up flowery top and denim shorts. \n Less sultry, but more feminine, girly, relaxed and summery. It can be glammed up with metallics and a pair of heels for a party or night out, or dressed down a bit with a jacket and some flat pumps or little boots to make you look effortlessly gorgeous for a date. While white can leave you looking washed out in the winter months, in the summer it will sit nicely against your tan making you look more golden. \n They go well with either shorts or jeans. They are good for people who have a good figure that they want to flaunt without looking too trashy. However be warned that tops that show too much tummy can look a bit tacky, so choose ones that only show a couple of inches, or only one side, or wear with high-waisted shorts or trousers. If you have a top that you like the pattern of, but not the shape, there are lots of ways you can alter it to your liking if you have a pair of scissors, just search for it on the internet to find out how to do it and get all those old t-shirts up to date with the trends. \n However this is what makes them interesting. They can look casual and carefree, but in-fashion at the same time, just shop around for the right type to suit you. If you find a style which flatters your shape then it's another great opportunity to show off the good bits of your figure without looking like you've tried too hard. Many floral ones are in the shops so you'll be hitting two trends with one stone. If you're not sure what you're going to be doing one day, stick on an outfit that you wouldn't mind getting dirty, and you can easily take it from casual to formal by sticking on a pair of heels and a nice bag. \n Look for slouchy, leather styles for really casual days. On days when you want to make more effort go for a more structured, colored bag. Have ones with long straps that you can just sling over your shoulder. \n Try wearing a big t-shirt over a pretty bikini with denim shorts. Or, you could wear a baggy vest top over a tight vest top. The clothes are unlikely to be sold as baggy clothes, just go and buy them a few sizes larger than you actually are. They'll be much more comfortable in the heat than a tight top, and you'll look gorgeous, but as if you didn't even try\n The above are just a few ideas for outfits, but there are many other things that you can wear in summer to make yourself look like a carefree girl. Just go for a look around the shops, and try to make sure that the things you end up with in your wardrobe are going to go well together so that you can mix and match things. Don't forget to make the most of your old, forgotten clothes. You could either re-shape them or belt them or something. \n Choose tinted moisturizer rather than foundation. It won't melt and run down your face when it's hot, and will let your natural prettiness shine through while still evening out your skin tone. A bit of lengthening mascara will help to widen your eyes while a line of eyeliner on your upper lid only will add a bit of drama without looking like you're wearing lots of make up. Keep your lips natural with a slick of lip balm and perhaps a neutral lip stain. \n

 The pattern of a major scales is whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step,whole step, and half step. The F major scale notes are F, G, A, B-flat, C, D, E, then F again. You can play this as two octaves, but start with the first octave, the lower one.\n On your right hand, put down your pinky and your index finger. \n The same as G except that your third finger on your left hand is up as well. \n Index and thumb down on your left hand and index and pinky down on your right. Make sure that your left thumb is on the lever closest to your right hand. You don't use the other one much, only in specific circumstances. \n Make sure your first finger is up for D because it only sounds barely different with it down, but it does change the pitch. \n The fingering is the same, but streamline the air a little more and blow it faster over the mouthpiece. \n The notes are the same as above, just you play them one octave up. Most of them have the same fingering but a few of them are different. If it is the same, the step will mention "look above", in reference to the first part above. The F that you start with is the same one that ended the last scale in Part 1. \n Look above. \n This is also the same fingering. Look above. \n This is the same, look above. \n It can be made using the aforementioned fingering for D but it is hard to do and almost never in tune. \n The fingering is the first two fingers and thumb on your left hand and the first two fingers on your right hand and no pinky. \n Like the D, you can play this as a normal F but it is easier to do with this finger up, and typically more in tune. \n 
 Talking with the parents of a gay child has to be done very delicately to determine if they want to discuss the situation. Determine if the parents are even willing to have dialog. If they are not willing, then there is simply nothing that anyone can do.\n Initially listen more than talk, and take notes. Regardless, the feelings of parents, no matter how logical, factually correct or "right" are still valid. \n Information from accredited mainstream universities and professional organizations is objective. Information with a religious or political slant, agenda or affiliation is suspect. Any assertion that vilifies "secular" education and research is a form of extremism which asserts that their agenda-based research is somehow objective. \n What are we trying to accomplish? If the objective is to make a gay child becomes heterosexual, then the parents can join the millions of other parents who how have taken the same misguided journey, only to create needless pain and suffering to themselves and others. The potential outcomes include intense psychological damage and often suicide. A human life is worth more than appeasing the political flavor and bias of the day. This is clearly demonstrated in Lifetime movie "Prayers for Bobby" which is one of the best LGBT family films ever made. \n Part of the solution should be the parents growing in their understanding - not the child "becoming" straight. This understanding can be found at: \n American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, American Medical Student Association, American Psychological Association http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx \n PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) \n Caitlin Ryan, PhD, ACSW, Stephen T. Russell, PhD, David Huebner, PhD, MPH, Rafael Diaz, PhD, MSW,and Jorge Sanchez, BA \n Family Acceptance in Adolescence and the Health of LGBT Young Adultsjcap_246 205..213 \n Bruce Bahemihl, Ph.D., Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity, St. Martin's Press, 2000, page 35. \n Any assertion that these sources somehow represent "propaganda" or are part of some "agenda" clearly flies in the face of every credible organization. \n The subject matter of a child coming out as gay needs to be stripped of any notion that this is somehow a disciplinary issue. It is not and it is psychological child abuse to treat as such. \n Feeling are more important than facts, however out of control feelings that hurt others are not acceptable. \n If so, then reach out to PFLAG and the Trevor Project who may be able to direct to local resources. \n Many parents have had a lifetime of social messages that reflect cultural or community bias. This will not be overcome in a simple conversation or two. \n This situation can go viral and volatile very quickly. Keep everyone calm. \n Non-accepting parents risk for their son or daughter to: \n Develop mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression \n Commit suicide \n Reject their entire family entirely and cut off all forms of communication for life \n Continue to involve additional family dramas in which people insult and hurt each other, no different than in the political arena. \n Part of this due care is taking the condemnation component out of the stereotype of the sexual orientation and work together to get to the solution. If the fear is that the gay child will become lost, lonely and have a future with bad outcomes - then consider positive LGBT role models who have indeed made healthy life choices and positive contributions to society. If the fear is that the child will be sexually irresponsible, then work with the child to value relationships, fidelity and good communication in relationships in a natural same-gender context. \n To an extent, this is about healthy choices and life skills. There are happy and healthy gay and straight people alike. Never allow a person's sexuality, gay or straight, to be come an excuse or entitlement to behave irresponsibly. Everyone of all sexual orientations all have the same moral and ethical duty to be responsible. \n "Homosexuality" is a clinical term which naturally invites distaste. "Homosexual acts" is a very degrading term (would a married heterosexual couple appreciate their intimate lovemaking to be demonized into "an act"?) Anyone can put their own spin on how the subject matter of sexual orientation is perceived even through language alone without rhetoric. Correct terminology is gay, lesbian bisexual or transgender (GLBT); same-gender relationships and same-gender intimacy. \n There is no such thing. There is no homogeneous lifestyle that "all" gay people live. "Gay" is a person's sexuality or sexual orientation which serves as a human attribute, not a "lifestyle choice". A lifestyle presupposes a set of stereotypes to which supposedly all LGBT persons would conform. This is simply not true. \n Much of the immoral behavior perpetuated by small number of gay men is the result of their own psychological disorders that stem from being rejected by their families or treated poorly by society, thus they rebel in act out in obnoxious and self-deprecating ways. Hollywood is quick to seize on this and often makes television characters out of the gay "victim" of social intolerance, instead of the successful gay professional who has overcome social intolerance, both psychologically, and with other's and their biases. \n Arguments of speculation are a needless exercise in hollow hypotheticals. Work with what is known and real and not allow fears to become a new reality. \n Just as parents might find it horrifying that their child wants to be with a member of the same gender - the sexuality of one's parents, even heterosexually, is not exactly an appealing image to any family member either. De-sexualize the subject matter and re-frame the context into the following: \n Knowledge and awareness \n Feelings \n The respect, privacy and dignity of everyone as a human being \n There is a better way. \n 
 Discuss some of your other options that exist for the other nearby Walt Disney World parks or local attractions in the area. With other major possibilities being the Epcot, the Disney (Hollywood/MGM) Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom and the mess of water parks and other activities that Disney sponsors, decide if this park is your best choice. \n The address to the Magic Kingdom is located at 3111 World Dr, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830.. The cost to park your car at the Magic Kingdom will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle). Depending on how far into the lots it took you to get to park, you could be located in either the Aladdin, Cruella, Hook, Jafar, Mulan, Peter Pan, Rapunzel, Scar, Simba, Ursula, Woody, or Zurg parking lots that are located on campus. , The parking lot for the Magic Kingdom is at the Ticket and Transportation Center (nicknamed by Disney enthusiasts as the TTC). The ride is about 10 minutes(by boat) and about 5-8 minutes (by monorail). \n You'll see Main Street USA directly in front of you. \n The Magic Kingdom is formed into about 6 lands around one central hub area/monument called Cinderella's Castle. These lands include Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, Liberty Square, Frontierland and Adventureland., The train makes one complete trip in 20 minutes, but gives you a general idea of what to expect and where to go and can pick you up and bring you elsewhere most of the time, so your feet don't walk miles around and back, many times. They have three trains that are authentic steam engines found by Disney from Mexico but were completely overhauled. \n Main Street USA is a long walkway that contains shops and a few desert-type bakeries. There aren't any real rides or shows in this section. However, when the parade comes through in Walt Disney World, it's nice to know; the parade marches down Main Street USA on it's way to it's exit/entrance gate nearby the Railroad. \n Walt decided to pay tribute to the famous Disney park contributors to thank them for all their hard work. He gave all these contributors a decal on a window. Some of them are rather hilarious (some don't just say the name but they take a humorous approach) and others are harder to spot. See how many you can spot and try to determine which designer they belong to. In the Magic Kingdom, there's a book out there that describes who's on these windows, but it hasn't been updated recently, so there could be more. \n Although the Emporium here (just at the one corner nearest the train station) supplies some really great souvenirs, there are others here such as the Plaza Ice Cream Shop where you can pick up an ice cream that isn't served from a cart. \n If you'd like, you can pick up monogrammed Mickey ears at the Chapeau, or stop by Crystal Arts, Kodak Camera Center (for camera supplies), or Disney Clothiers for even more great souvenirs. But you have to judge what you'll need from this street in terms of souvenirs. \n Although with babies you can get a "Babies First Haircut with a certificate to remember this special moment (as Disney says, "Magical Moment") you yourself can get ones from here too. \n These legendary performers have straw hats, colorful striped vests, bowties, spats and taps. They sing four-part harmony for a short while and can sometime interact with guests if they aren't singing. \n Disney's Magic Kingdom provides horse-drawn trolleys, an omnibus (at times), a jitney or a horseless carriage. Sometimes their fire engine runs and takes some passengers with them. Most of them take you from the entrance near the Fire Station to the hub area located near Cinderella Castle at the center of the park. \n Although this is a place to stop and spend a few minutes, watch a few minutes of an old time movie such as Steamboat Willie which tends to never close. \n Storytellers depicts Walt as he would have looked in 1923 standing with Mickey as he was seen in the 1930s. This statue is engraved by two plaques on either side of the statue at ground level. \n Cinderella's Castle is at the hub of the park and will take you from the Hub to Fantasyland. \n You'll find several great places such as Tony's Town Square and the Plaza Restaurant to satisfy most eating needs. For quick service, there's Casey's Corner and the Main Street Confectionary and Bakery (Bakery features Starbucks Coffee). \n Tomorrowland contains a futuristic view of what life might be like for most Americans. \n "Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin" is a fun ride where you get to compete with the person sitting next to you! You shoot at the "Z" targets throughout the ride. \n The Carousel of Progress was once an exhibit at the 1964 World's Fair in New York, NYand was one of Walt's own ideas that he instilled in it's creators/builders. \n The Astro Orbitor will give you a "spin" that you will likely never forget (though this spin is perfectly safe, since you ride a "spaceship"). \n This very slow moving ride can take a little while, but moves super slow and is nice and cool as it rides past and along the edge of some buildings. At one point, you can see inside of Space Mountain (and when the lights are turned on in Space Mountain, you can see part of it's track layout.) \n Anyone who's driven a car can drive these things, but there is a height restriction to reach the pedal, so if you are a kid, ask your parents to help you. \n This is an interactive show that even involves the audience at certain points, and is sure to make you laugh. \n This is an attraction that is nice if you have Stitch lovers in your party, and it has multiple stages, so plan ahead to spend a few minutes here if you want to do it. \n Don't ride Dumbo, if the wait line is long. Dumbo is very popular with the young and young-at-heart crowd. However, due to the 2012 addition of a second Dumbo next door, that line may be shortened quite a bit, but sometimes still does grow to long lengths that are only half as long. \n You may receive a pager while you wait that will let you know when it's time to ride. If you do, allow your kids to blow off steam in the play area that is located in the area where you wait. \n This ride is relatively new, and has been known to have long waits. If you want to avoid that, consider getting to the ride first thing when the park opens, and the line may not be as long. \n The Barnstormer can be found near the railroad depot for Fantasyland. \n The It's a Small World ride is a staple of many family's vacation plans to the Magic Kingdom. \n It's neat to be able to see the town and areas that were once shown in the movie, up close. \n Not only will you learn some interesting facts about the presidency, but seeing some of these audio animatronics that look life-like of each of our last presidents is very amazing to all who visit. \n Also take note of the official presidential seal in the waiting room. Don't try to climb over the railing to get close to the seal. It's closely-guarded and police will come and get you if you try to climb over the barricade and try to take a picture with it (escorting you completely out of the building). \n "Arrrgggh, matey! Ahoy lads!" \n It's nice and cool inside and you can take a long load off your feet for a little while. The show lasts about 10-15 minutes (depending on how long you must wait to exit standing in line). \n Jungle cruise is a cruise along the Walt-Disney World river featuring several audio animatronic animals and even some audio animatronic Native American Indians join in the "party". This is a good start for a cool, misty ride (especially if it's windy and rainy (though each boat is covered in a top on top of you)). \n Don't worry if you don't get to experience the thrill; it's much like Dumbo, but you fly on carpet-looking instruments. \n Not only do you have to walk up many, many stairs, but also with no elevator to take you to the top, and on top of that, there's little to see and do once you reach the top! \n Your heart will be pounding from the thrill you'll receive here, and you'll be ready for more action. Splash Mountain is good on those days when it's hot and humid, but the lines tend to be crazy long by Noon, so get here first thing if you'd like to ride. \n This ride always closes down the moment any lightning or thunder is observed in this region of the state. However, they do send down "test cars" as a just-in-case measure, to check when the area is safe and still keeps the car motors running smoothly. You should see empty cars while this ride is underway during a thunderstorm. \n Reach to go through it from the Main Street end of the hub in the park. It is quite immense when you walk through it. Most people try to get a feel for it's size, so be one of those visitors and try it out., Especially in the holiday season(including different ones for Halloween and Christmas - (hence HalloWishes and Holiday Wishes), Wishes is very interesting and makes you want to feel like a kid again. Almost any place in the Magic Kingdom is a good place to watch Wishes, however, Main Street USA facing Cinderella Castle is by far the best (and most-popular) area to watch it (so be there bright and early before people catch on to your viewing spot). Try to get to your chosen viewing spot at least half an hour to an hour in advance, as viewing spots everywhere tend to fill up quickly. \n Though the monorail is quick and will get you past the hot sticky feeling when your feet are tired on the boat, but no matter what time of day the same two options are still available. \n 
 Teachers assign notes so that you will be familiar with the topic being discussed in class. If you do the assigned notes before class, you’ll already know many of the background details. Then you can focus your note-taking on key concepts. \n Read through your notes from the previous lecture before class as well. This will help you get back up to speed on where you last left off in the class.\n If your teacher provides outlines, PowerPoint slides, or even a basic summary of the upcoming lecture, use it to your advantage. Think of it as the framing for a house, which you will then complete and furnish with your note-taking. \n It may be tempting to just print out that lecture outline or slideshow and figure you can skip note-taking during class -- or just jot down a few things on the printout here and there. But it is much better to use these materials to structure your notes. This is the best way to process information, which is after all the goal of note-taking., Many students are more comfortable typing than writing, but there are still reasons to consider the tried-and-true method of putting pen to paper. Some studies indicate that students who hand-write notes are more able to comprehend and recall lecture material than those who type. It can be easier to fall into transcription mode on a laptop. This is when where you try to type everything said instead of actively discerning what is most important to write down. Writing things down by hand can help you achieve greater focus.On the other hand, using a laptop or other electronic device makes it easier to format, save, edit, share, and read notes (with no worries about messy handwriting). \n Note-taking aids available on laptops are nearly endless, such as: “notebook layout” formatting on Microsoft Word, etc.; software that connects a recording of the lecture to your notes; note organization programs that let you unite materials of various type and formats, such as emails and PDFs; and collaborative note-taking platforms that allow you to team up with others to take notes in real time. These may be lifesavers or distractions for you. Only you can judge what works best. \n Some instructors and institutions ban the use of laptops in class, so don’t discount the need to know how to write notes by hand. \n Choose a spot in the class where you will have few distractions. Then you will be able to pay attention better and take better notes. Find a spot where you can see and hear the lecturer clearly. You should also be able to see the board clearly. Show up to class a little early to ensure you get your pick of seats. \n If you find yourself distracted by noisy fellow students, an air conditioning vent, or an unfortunate glare on the projector screen, discreetly move to a new seat if you can do so without causing a significant disruption. Otherwise, do your best this time and find a new spot for the next time. \n If you take notes by hand, bring extra pens or pencils and paper. If you take notes on a laptop or other electronic device, make sure it is sufficiently charged and ready to go as soon as class begins. \n Some people prefer using loose note sheets so they can lay them out on the table or floor when studying, while others find bound notebooks more tidy. \n Make sure your notes are clearly labeled for future reference. Write the date of the lecture and the topic at the top of each page.If you have multiple pages of notes, include page numbers as well. This will help you keep your notes in order. \n The more orderly your notes are at creation, the easier they will be to understand, revise, and study. One option is the outline format, especially if the lecture is clearly structured and/or presented in such a manner. In this format, you’ll have section headings. Underneath each section heading, write down ideas in bullet form and supplementary ideas with indented sub-bullets. This is much better than just writing down everything as a new point. \n Be warned that lecturers are not always organized about following main points with subpoints. Keep in mind that you may have to reorganize your notes after the lecture. \n In order to take better notes, you need to be an “active listener.” This means that you don’t just record what is said. Instead, you should engage with the material and determine the essential elements of what is being said. \n For instance, instead of spending time writing down every detail of Theodore Roosevelt's various foreign policy actions, strive to establish key concepts of his overall foreign policy and identify the examples as support. This way, you have already begun the process of learning and understanding (or, in other words, studying). \n This necessity of active engagement is one reason why many experts advise against recording lectures.,If you do insist on recording lectures, or have a legitimate need to do so. Ask the professor beforehand if it’s okay to record. The lecture is considered the professor’s intellectual property. In addition, some institutions have specific policies regarding recording. \n Don’t waste time easing your way into note-taking mode at the beginning of class. Be ready to go from the very start. \n Lectures often begin with an explicit preview of what will be covered, or at least implicit “leads” about what is to follow. Listen carefully to the opening of the lecture for context clues that can help your organization and discernment of what will be most important. \n Don’t pay attention to students who arrive late or who are not yet ready to take notes. \n Every instructor organizes each lecture into some sort of outline, even if it's implicit and loosely followed. The information that is included on lecture slides will give you a solid idea of how to keep your notes organized. \n The lecturer will use vocal patterns, hand gestures and other indications to emphasize important parts of the lecture. Start observing these patterns and gestures in order to discern what is essential information..Recognize main ideas by identifying signal words and phrases that indicate something important is to follow. Your instructor is not going to send up a rocket when she states an important new idea or gives an example. But she will use signals to convey what she is doing. Every good speaker does it, and you should expect to receive these signals. Examples include: \n There are three reasons why... \n First... second... third... \n The significance of this is... \n The impact of this is... \n From this, we can see… \n Learn to identify other clues as well. When making a key point, the lecturer may speak more slowly or loudly; repeat a word or phrase; take a longer pause before resuming speaking (perhaps even to take a drink of water); gesture with his or her hands more demonstratively; stop walking around and / or look more intently into the audience; and so on. \n Shorthand writing is a way to use shortcuts so that you don’t have to write every single word. You can also write notes more quickly, an essential skill when listening to a classroom lecture. But when taking notes, don’t use true shorthand like a stenographer. This requires lengthy transcription. Instead, develop your own set of shortcuts, abbreviations, symbols, sketches, etc. Even if no one else knows what your shorthand means, you’ll know what you mean.Use abbreviations and skip unimportant words to take notes efficiently. Only record the important words that you need to get the idea of the point made. Skip words like "the" and "a" that do not convey additional meaning to the lecture content. Create abbreviations to help you write things down quickly, such as drawing arrows for increase/decrease or to show causation, and especially for terms used over and over again (e.g., IR for international relations). \n Paraphrase everything except formulas and specific definitions or facts that will likely be required verbatim on the exam.Underline, circle, star, highlight, or otherwise identify key examples, definitions, or other important materials. Devise your own marking code to indicate each type. \n Try drawing diagrams or pictures for concepts you can't quickly describe or immediately understand. For instance, draw a pie chart to roughly indicate the relative strength of political parties in a particular election instead of writing these details out. \n Make sure your letters and words are adequately spaced and legible so that you can read them later. Few things are more frustrating than being unable to read your own handwriting, especially when trying to study for a biology exam. \n Don’t try to cram as much as possible onto each sheet.Give yourself lots of white space on your page. More spaced-out writing allows plenty of room for revision and annotation later. This style is also easier to read and digest the information when studying. \n It is easy to zone out as the clock ticks near the end of the class period. Other students may be starting to gather up their materials and whisper with their friends about what’s for lunch. However, the conclusion of the lecture is just as vital as the introduction in laying out the big picture and key themes and concepts. \n If there is a summary at the end of the lecture, pay close attention to it. You can use it to check the organization of your notes. If your notes seem disorganized, copy down the main points that are covered in the summary. It will help in revising your notes later., During lecture, as well as at the end of the lecture, make sure to ask questions about points that you don’t understand. When other students ask questions, write down the questions and the instructor's answers.This additional information might answer questions you have as well. \n If you are self-conscious about holding up the class by asking a question (and annoying the students who already have one foot out the door), ask your professor after class. You’ll likely find other students doing the same, and can listen in on their questions as well. \n You can also bring a list of questions to your professor’s office hours. \n Do your review within 24 hours after the lecture. By this time, you may have already forgotten 80% of the lecture material.Build upon what you have learned, instead of having to re-learn the material. \n Think of your in-class notes as your draft copy, and the revision as your edited copy. Create a new version of your notes. This will be helpful especially if your notes are sloppy, disorganized, or borderline illegible. Don’t just copy down your notes as you originally wrote them. Make this part an active process of revision.Use the clues you picked up during the lecture regarding structure and key concepts to reorganize what you wrote down. \n Fill in weak spots with material from the textbook. \n When you are revisiting your notes, you should also spend time to highlight or underline important parts of the lecture. Use different colored highlighters or pens to color-code recurring concepts. Marked-up notes will be valuable when you begin to study for the test. These allow you to quickly and efficiently recall key parts of each lecture. \n If you have missed a class due to illness or another reason, you should be sure to get notes from a classmate. Talk with the instructor as well so that you understand the material. \n Don’t rely on a notes-for-sale service. Most universities have a policy against using these types of notes.Remember, using purchased notes is not “active learning” that aids in understanding and retention. \n If you have a physical or other documented disability which makes note-taking difficult, discuss options with your professor and your institution’s student services. Various options, including perhaps special lecture guides, note-taking assistance, permission to record lectures, or tutoring, will likely be available. \n The Cornell Method is a way to take notes that involves first taking notes and then developing questions from those notes. Divide your sheet into two sections by drawing a vertical line about 2.5 inches from the left margin. Continue this line until about two inches from the bottom of the sheet. Then draw a horizontal line two inches from the bottom edge. \n For laptop users, there are programs that can format your word processor in Cornell Method style. \n In the largest section of your now-divided page, take notes on the main ideas of the lecture as you go. Leave ample space for later revisions. \n Add examples, diagrams, charts, and other material that the instructor discusses. \n The left-side section of your page is used for generating your own questions from the lecture notes. These questions may help clarify points, definitions, and so on. Review your notes within one or two days. This will ensure that your recall of the information will be stronger. \n You can develop potential test questions from this material. What do you think the instructor is going to ask on an exam? \n When you are studying your notes for an exam, cover the right-hand side of the page. See if you can answer the questions that you’ve included on the left-hand side. \n Use the bottom section of your page to provide a summary of this page’s notes. This will help you recall the important points for this portion of the lecture. \n 
 Now look for an icon labeled "Windows Movie Maker" and open it. The application window should open up.\n Click and drag whatever video and audio files you need (or want) into the large empty area. Now click "Storyboard". A menu should open up. Select "Timeline". If Timeline is already selected, you don't have to worry about this. Now there should be three tracks visible at the bottom of the window in the Timeline view: Video, Audio/Music, and Title Overlay. Now drag the desired audio tracks onto the Audio/Music track in the order you want them. \n Click and drag it into the video track. \n Optimally, you want to type in something you'll remember, such as "Track1". It doesn't matter too much where you save the project file, however. Now click the "Save" button. Note that this step is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT if you want to go to the trouble of making modifications to your project later. \n A window should show up asking you where you want to publish your movie. Select "This computer". Now press the "Next" button. \n Make the file name something you can remember, such as "Track1". If it's already the name you want, don't do anything. Also, by default, the drop-down menu labeled "Publish to:" should be on the "Videos" folder. If it's not, browse for the "Videos" folder by going into the folder labeled with your User Account name and looking for the folder labeled "Videos". If the Videos folder is already selected, leave the menu like that and click the "Next" button. \n If you don't know what to do here, it is recommended that you click "Best quality for playback on my computer (recommended)", not because the computer says it is recommended, but because it would probably be irrelevant to this this article to explain what the other settings mean. Now click the "Publish" button. \n Once it says "Your movie has been published", you're still far from done! Now open up the "Videos" folder (you did publish your movie to the Videos folder, right?). If you don't know where it is, open up the folder labeled with your User Account name. It should be in there. Now find the movie you just published. It should be a ".wmv" file with the name you designated. \n Now hold down the "Ctrl" key on the keyboard and then press the "N" key, or just go into the "File" menu and select "New Project". If Movie Maker asks you if you want to save the changes you made to your project, click "No" unless you didn't save and want to save now, or made desirable changes to the project after you saved it the first time. The "Video" and "Audio/Music" tracks should be reset. However, you haven't lost anything. \n If you hit the Play button, you will hear the audio files you put in even though the track is labeled "Video". Why? Because the Video track has it's own "Audio" track, but in order to use it, you have to put a movie file into it that has an audio track, and then Movie Maker will automatically place the file's audio track into the "Video" track's "Audio" track. Now you see why you had to go though all of this, right? Now put the next set of audio files you want into the Audio/Music track, in the order you want. \n It was warned that this could be very time-consuming, correct? At step #4, be sure to enter a different project file name every time you add a new track. Also, every time you add a new track, it will be merged with the previous track. Lastly described by this step, at each step, try to be VERY SURE that you have the desired results because it can potentially be quite time-consuming to make any modifications to the final result (the reason is described under the "Tips" section). \n How to convert the movie file into just a plain-old audio file? Very easy. Click and drag your 'final' movie file to the formerly empty space in the Movie Maker window described in step #9. Now click and drag it again. However, this time, don't drag it to the "Video" track; instead, drag it to the "Audio/Music" track. Now repeat steps #5-8. 4 is recommended as well, but not as strongly. At step #7, there should be a few changes to the window that displays. If you're not sure, leave the settings as they are, but if you want a specific sound quality, you can select "More settings", click on the drop-down menu labeled "High-quality audio", and then select which quality you want. This should take much faster than it did with the movie files because this is a straight audio file without any movie. Now you're done. Find your finished file, open it up, and enjoy. Hopefully, this article was helpful to you. If not, make sure you followed the steps very carefully. \n 
 The number of t-shirt logos you want to use will determine the size of your blanket. However, if you want a bigger quilt and you don't have enough t-shirts, you can make blocks out of the plain fabric on the back of your t-shirt or buy patterned cotton fabric. \n Approximately 12 t-shirts (3 by 4 blocks) will make a throw sized blanket. 20 shirts (4 by 5 blocks) will make a twin bed sized quilt. 30 shirts (5 by 6 blocks) will make a double sized quilt. 36 shirts (6 by 6 blocks) will make a queen sized quilt and 42 shirts (6 by 7 blocks) will make a king sized quilt.\n Treat any stains before you throw them in the wash. It will be hard to remove deep stains later on in the process. \n The amount you need will depend upon the size of t-shirt quilt you would like. You want to have 2.5 inch (6.4 cm) borders and 2 inch (5.1 cm) pieces for sashing. \n Choose something that either matches your décor or matches your t-shirts. You may also want to use the same fabric for the back of your blanket. \n Use cold water and low heat in the washer and dryer to ensure dark colors do not fade. \n Decide if your block designs will fit in a 12 by 12 inch block or if they need to be 14 by 14 inch blocks. All the blocks need to be the same size. \n You will adhere this to the back of your t-shirt squares to keep your blanket squares from stretching. Buy enough to have approximately 17 inch (43.2 cm) squares of interfacing for all of your blanket blocks. \n Center the logo and cut 15 inch (38.1 cm) squares with a rotary cutter, if your final blocks will be 12 inches (30.5 cm). Cut 17 inch (43.2 cm) squares if your final blocks will measure 14 inches (35.6 cm). \n Lay the t-shirt square with the logo down. Lay the fusible interfacing with the resin side down, on the back of your t-shirt square. \n Follow the package instructions to ensure you attach the fusing correctly. \n Use a rotary cutter or fabric scissors. This will give enough room for seam allowance. \n Determine how you want your quilt to be arranged. Try to put intricate designs next to simple ones and light colors next to dark ones. \n They should be either 15 inches (38.1 cm) by 2 inches (5.1 cm) or 13 inches (33.0 cm) by 2 inches (5.1 cm), depending upon the size of your blocks. Pin the sashing to the bottom of the blocks, with a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. \n The bottom blocks of the blanket do not need horizontal strips, because they will be next to the border. \n Use a 1/4 seam allowance for the entire project. Sew 4, 5, 6 or 7 columns together, depending upon the size of your quilt. \n You do not need to measure and cut vertical sashing strips for the outside edges, because you will have borders. Sew 1 sashing strip to the right of each column. \n Cut off any excess fabric around your blanket top. Once your columns are sewn, it is time to begin your borders. \n The strips should be 25 inches (12.7 cm) wide. Pin the borders to your blanket top. \n Measure a layer of batting that is the length and width of your blanket. Set the layer of batting on top of your quilt top. \n It should be the length and width of your completed quilt top. Cut it with a rotary cutter or fabric scissors. \n Stitch around the outside of your quilt with a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. Leave 1 side of the quilt open so that you can turn the quilt right side out. \n Pin the remaining open side closed by turning the edges under. Hand sew the remaining side with a needle and thread. \n Alternately, you can hand stitch down the sashing on your quilt. This will keep your batting and quilt blocks from moving around and bunching on the inside of your blanket. \n 
\n Now browse to the location where you have saved the copy of "master.mdf", select it and click "Open". \n Select and click "OK". \n The password associated with them are either categorized as "UNKNOWN" or "EMPTY", where UNKNOWN denotes that password exists for that user and is in encrypted form, while EMPTY means there is no password set for that particular user. \n Click "OK" thereafter. \n Now you have to move the processed master.mdf and mastlog.ldf backup file to its original location so that original master.mdf and mastlog.ldf files gets replaced with these processed file. \n to locate its location,On the Start menu, point to All Programs, Microsoft SQL Server 2005, Configuration Tools, and then click SQL Server Surface Area Configuration.The first page to appear is the SQL Server Surface Area Configuration start page. Click "Surface Area configuration for Services and Connections" \n Now click on "Start" button and when the service status changes from "Stopped" to "Running" just click on "OK" button.. \n Don't forget to generate new password thereafter. \n 
 They will usually be in the herb section of the store. Valerian seeds can be finicky, so this is the best way to ensure you will have young plants for your garden.\n If valerian grows naturally in your area, you can usually find a number of young plants sprouting in the spring. Dig up the root system and plant it in your garden after the last frost. \n Purchase fresh seeds that are less than one year old. Unlike other herb seeds, valerian seeds don’t take well to storage. \n Plant them in a rich seed starting mix four to eight weeks before you want to plant them in your garden. \n Sprinkle the soil with warm water and keep the plants in the sun. Fluorescent lights and grow lights can aid germination rates. \n If your home is somewhat cold, you can try creating a mini-greenhouse over your seed trays with plastic wrap. \n Valerian doesn’t generally require a lot of fertilization unless the soil is poor. The soil should be between 5.5 and 7.0 in pH., The plants do well with some afternoon shade. \n They are large plants, so they need plenty of room to grow roots.If your valerian plants don’t tend to grow to a full four feet (1.2 m) tall, you may be able to plant them closer together. \n It can send out runners, so it may be best when offset from a vegetable or flower garden. Harvesting the blooms can keep it from being too invasive. \n Valerian leaves and roots are known for a strong, musty odor. The flowers can smell of vanilla, but are too strong for some gardeners. Keep this in mind before planting near a patio. \n Valerian likes well-drained soil and plenty of water. Soak it every few days when you are not receiving regular rain., This keeps the plant from going to seed and spreading too far.It can also make the roots more potent if you are harvesting them for a sleep aid. \n Use a sharp pair of shears and cut near the base of the stem. \n Valerian starts blooming early in the spring. You may get two or three blooms, depending upon the placement of the plant and its age. \n Harvest mature root systems in the fall for drying. Allow the plant to go a few days without water before you harvest so that the natural compounds are more potent. \n You can also dig up older plants for medicinal use and let younger volunteers grow for next year. \n Rinse the roots off with your garden hose before you take them inside. \n Wash them thoroughly by soaking them in a bowl. \n Let them dry in a cool, dry place for two to three months. They are extremely pungent, so they shouldn’t be dried on a kitchen table.Simmer the roots for use as a sleep aid. \n You can also give the dried roots to cats, who love it like catnip., Use clean, fresh leaves as a nighttime relaxation tea or dry them to make a loose-leaf tea blend. \n 
 If you can't do either, you can learn an instrument, or take singing lessons. Bass is a good one to learn, since it's not too hard for most songs. Singing lessons could be costly, but it's worth it if you really want to start a band, right?\n Use a name that sounds cool, or means something to you. Once you actually have a band, discuss the name, because it's usually the whole band who chooses the name. You don't want to be accused of having all the fun, because if you argue with your band, you may as well just give up. \n Make sure it's okay with the head teacher, or whoever it is in charge of that kind of thing. Putting the notices on a music department notice board is good, since people interested in music are going to be looking at it. Consider putting "band practice" or "band auditions" in large, bold font to attract the reader's attention. It's all advertising, right? Would you stop to read an advert if it hadn't caught your eye? Make the notice as big and bright as possible. \n If you have an argument with your friend or split up with your girlfriend/boyfriend, you'll be screwed, especially if they played a big part like vocals or lead guitar, because rock isn't rock without a guitarist, right? \n If they can hardly play drums and you need a drummer, don't just ask the first person available, you can live without a drummer for a while, so long as you have a good bassist and a (optional) metronome to practice with, you'll be fine. If the opportunity comes along, great, get in there and seize your chance, but if not, you'll probably just have to get on with the band. \n If no one is what you're looking for, make the deadline a little longer, but if you find all the right people, lucky you! Take down the notices or modify them to say that all the places are taken. Here is a common mistake that a lot of people make when forming a band:they only use the people who look the part. Obviously portraying the band's image in a good way is mandatory, but work on that later, why choose looks over talent? If that guy with heavy eyebrows is a drum prodigy, why choose the guy with lovely golden curls when he's an average, maybe even below average, drummer? \n Yes, that means reading and researching. Sorry! But you didn't expect to just start writing songs and be amazing, did you? Most songs go like this: \n Verse 1 \n Bridge (optional) \n Chorus \n Verse 2 \n Chorus \n Bridge (optional) \n Chorus (repeated two to four times) \n You can start off by covering songs of your favorite artists, or artists who are similar to you, or you can start writing right now. It's better to start writing straight away, because then you can only get better and better. It's good to cover some songs too though, especially is you've got writers block. It happens to all of us, even huge songwriters can get stuck. To write a song, think of a "story line". Maybe something that's happened to you that made you angry, upset, or happy. It's a good idea to not make the song scream this out, but making the song based around the event makes the listener intrigued (that's why they go on the Internet and find out what the meanings are of their favorite songs). It's also a lot easier if you and the band sit together and brainstorm ideas, then you can all share experiences and therefore making songwriting a little easier because you might have a great experience but it could be painfully difficult to write about. \n Write down, on separate pieces of paper so you don't get confused, all the emotions, thoughts, and bits of memory that come through when you think about your experience. This could be a bad example, but let's just pretend for a minute that a few years ago you went on, say, the world's highest, scariest roller coaster. Think about what you would remember the most. Was it when you were getting on and you were scared stupid, or when you got off. Yep, you guessed it- getting on, because you were so scared it sticks out in your mind and you'll probably never forget it. \n Now you've got some lines! It's much easier to start off with a chorus, so now all the main work is done. If you sing it and it sounds good and you can't get it out of your head, great! You've successfully created a catchy chorus. And what's the thing that most people remember about their favorite songs? That's right; the chorus. \n It might take a while to get it fit into a tune, but again, if it sounds good, you've hit the nail on the head. It doesn't matter if all the lines make sense, but they should be more or less related. Don't let yourself fall into the trap of making things rhyme for the heck of it. The basic "two lines rhyme, then the next two rhyme with a different ending" is good. Even words that rhyme only a little (Manage me I'm a mess/ Turn a page, I'm a book half unread- All Time Low - Weightless) work well. \n This probably the easiest part of composing a song, but putting actual layers in the song is sometimes devilishly hard. Where should we put a dramatic pause? Or guitar riff? Is the lead guitarist going to do a solo? Should there be a part where there is no background music and then there is a line sung A Capella? How is the drum beat going to go? More importantly- how is the bassline going to go? What guitar tune should we put in the back? All huge questions, all difficult to answer, but it only comes with time. Sit down with the band and discuss the songs on by one. Ask your fellow bandmates to write down anything that they come up with, whether it be in Chemistry class, while practicing completed songs, or while playing a video game. Never leave it- always write down your ideas, because there's nothing worse than having an amazing idea, only to lose it in your mind. Meanwhile, focus on writing more songs and get some venues. \n Obviously while you're just starting off don't expect people to let you just perform at the local gig. Start off with school assemblies. if people like you, awesome! You have fans! When you get pretty good, see if you can get a gig locally. Don't expect to be performing at Warped Tour! Hire a venue if you can. Maybe a city hall or anything available of a similar description. This might be a little costly, but make sure the people who come and watch you leave with some awesome music ringing in their ears. You want them to like you as soon as they look at you. So smile, have a stage presence and a sense of humor. Poke fun at yourself, saying things like you've never performed properly before and so excuse you if you're pretty bad. Put on a good show, and it will be worth the money you paid for the venue, because the people coming to watch you will have fun, but more importantly you'll have an insanely awesome time that you'll want to relive over and over again. If you're enjoying yourself, let the audience know it! Smile, dance crazily and look like you're having so much fun it's almost criminal. \n Once you have your first gig, let people know about it. Put up posters on community notice board. \n "Yeah, I did. BUT..." But nothing. If there's a "but" after they say "yes", you need to work on things. Get their opinion and work around that. If they say that they don't like the music, that is their choice. Tell yourself that if one person doesn't like it, then they're missing out! \n It's hard at first to have ideas, but just keep trying! If you're passionate about your rock band, then you'll stick it out until the end. Being in a band makes you develop a superglue bond with your bandmates. You'll go through hell and high water with them. Remember when Bob Bryar left My Chemical Romance? Everyone was very sad, but look how far My Chemical Romance has come since then. Remember when Brownsound left Sum 41? It was awful! But Sum 41 carried on and made great music. What I'm saying is that even if one of the band leaves, it's not the end of the world (however it is a very good idea to have two guitarists so if one leaves, you have a backup), just struggle through it until you can find a replacement. The best bands have had some sort of struggle. My Chemical Romance's Gerard Way's drug problem- he got over it and he now feels squeaky clean. Josh and Zac Farro leaving Paramore - they got over it. Just remember to love your music and have a good time. \n 
 Responsibility means doing the things that need to be done. It also means being honest and reliable. All of this plays into what parents will say when you ask them for a sleepover. If you want to be treated maturely, be mature., Whether you have your parents' trust or not, permission often depends on the night you're planning the sleepover for. If you want to sleepover on a school night, parents are usually unlikely to give you permission. On the other hand, a night during summer vacation will stand a better chance. If you want to increase the chances of getting permission, you should plan to spend the night when there's nothing happening the next day. \n Sleepovers are generally harder to get permission for if they're co-ed. Moms and dads can be uncomfortable if boys and girls are sleeping over together, and may have firmer rules depending on their values., It can be very difficult and slow to rebuild if it is broken. In order to have trust between parent and child, you should be talking to them every day. Let them know about everything that's happening in your life. It's good to make this a normal thing for your relationship with them. This will help a lot more than your chances for sleepovers. \n In your case, keeping up with homework and household chores will prove that you deserve to go out and let loose. If there's anything that needs to be done before you ask them make a point of doing it first. Don't let an unfinished chore be used against you when you ask to spend the night. \n As unfair as it may seem, part of what depends on whether your parents give permission is the mood you're in when they ask. If they're already upset about something before you approach, it's almost guaranteed that they will say no. This is because they do not want to deal with any added stress. \n One thing you might do is see what you can do to help your parents out before asking. That way, they'll be in a better mood, and you'll have proven yourself deserving in their eyes. \n Asking your parents can be stressful depending on the kind of relationship you have with them, but it needs to be done calmly. Above all else, you need to say it in a way that isn't going to make it sound like a negative interaction. If you go into it with a pessimistic mindset, it's all the more likely your parents will deny you. \n It can be good to offer a few details before asking the question. This can help avoid a quick 'no'. Say something like this: "My friend is having her birthday tomorrow, and wanted to have a pizza sleepover to celebrate. Would it be okay if I went over there and spent the night tomorrow?" \n Sitting down next to them while you ask can be a helpful trick, as it will make them feel less rushed in their decision. \n If possible, it's a good idea to ask the question a couple of days in advance. Parents are usually more likely to react positively to a request in advance, rather than a last-minute plan. \n If parents are feeling nervous about letting their child out for the evening, giving them all the details will put them at ease.Giving them a run-down of the plans and things they may want to know will be a great help. Being honest and upfront about it will give you the highest chance of getting their permission. Here are some things you should tell them: \n Where you'll be staying. \n Whether you're planning on leaving your friend's house at some point in the evening. \n What kind of parental supervision is expected. This is a big one. \n Whether anyone else will be the home. That includes siblings of your friend or other relatives. \n What your friend's family situation is like. \n Even if you're going to a sleepover for the sake of having fun, there are a lot of extra benefits to a kid sleeping over. Letting your parents know the benefits can ease them into thinking it's a good thing for your upbringing. Try bringing up some of these if they're having a hard time budging:Children at sleepovers learn new social skills. They have to be flexible in a new environment. \n You're going to get a fresh perspective of another family during a sleepover.Try not to make this one sound like you want to escape from your own family! \n A child being out of the house gives parents a chance to relax. \n Sleepovers can be an enjoyable treat once in a while. \n Ask about the main issue that they're worried about, and ask what can be done to solve it. Keep your focus on finding a solution, rather than letting yourself get angry. \n Popping a question about this should be straightforward and calm. Say something like: "I understand that you may be worried over me going out tonight. What in particular is bothering you? Maybe we can find a way to fix it." \n Contact info is important, both for the child and the parents. Your parents will want to be able to get a hold of you no matter what. Even if they never call the number it will put them at ease to have a number they can call if they don't hear anything from you.This should be the home phone of the house you're staying at, or the cell number of your friend's parents. \n Don't give fake numbers. Even if you manage to make it out this time, messing around with your parents will ruin their trust and your chances for future sleepovers. \n Parents can feel helpless if their child if sleeping somewhere else. If you replan the sleepover to happen at your place, you can stand a chance of making things work. That way, you'll have time with a friend, and your parents will still feel like they're in control.Some parents are automatically against any friends staying the night at their home, so don't take this as a surefire alternative plan. \n It can be risky to ask for a sleepover once you're already there, but impromptu plans do happen. If you want a sneakier approach, you can ask to go over for dinner, as dinners are usually easier to get permission for. After dinner, you can get relaxed and call up your parents to ask. Sometimes, a parent will have an easier time giving permission for something that is already happening. If you choose this however, you should be prepared for disappointment. Some parents won't take kindly to you trying to pull a fast one under their noses. \n It's a good idea to pack your sleepover things just in case. \n In order for this to work out, your parents will probably have to know the family you're staying with well. It also helps if you have had successful sleepovers at that place before. \n Parents like set plans. Give them a rough idea of when you'll be back. That way, they'll be able to relax for the time being. Set plans are a good thing, as they help to fight stress and worry. \n At the same time, you should be flexible with when they can pick you up. A lot of adults have a lot going on throughout their day, so it should be up to them when you are picked up the next day., If you tell them you're going to do something and do something else, you risk ruining trust. Especially if you're not used to spending the night out, it's important to show them you can be trusted. \n Part of your parents' decision depends on what they think of the friend you want to sleepover with. In most cases however, their ultimate concern is your safety. They want to make sure you'll be taken care of. That's where the friend's parents come in. If your parents can put a name to a face, it will set their minds at ease when you ask to sleepover., If your parents don't already know your friend, it's a good idea to put a name to a face. By introducing them, your parents can see that your friend isn't near as bad as they may have feared. Even unruly friends tend to be well-behaved when other parents are around. \n Your parents will probably be trying to decide the sort of danger your friend may put your in. If your friend is known to be belligerent and irresponsible, you'll have a very hard time convincing them that it's a good idea to stay the night. \n By taking a leave from your own home, you need to take responsibility for yourself. That includes knowing to leave if you don't want to stay anymore.If you feel sick or don't feel comfortable spending the night anymore, call up your parents. Even if it's late, your parents will probably be happy that you decided to call rather than sit through something unpleasant. If anything, it will prove to them that you can be trusted to call out a bad situation when you see one. \n Keeping your parents up to date with everything will make them feel more at ease. When you're either picked up or get home, talk to your parents a bit about how the sleepover was. What sort of stuff did you get up to? Was it fun? What was your friend's family like to be around? All of these can help show your parents that a sleepover is a healthy activity. \n Remember: You don't just want to make this sleepover work. You also want to ensure future sleepovers. Making it a pleasant experience for everyone involved will make sure you have the highest chance of more sleepovers. \n 
 Most card collectors use binders to keep their cards. A binder offers safety and an accessible showcase if you want to show your cards off to someone. You should prepare to buy a high-quality binder that's appropriate for displaying such high-value items. Boxes, on the other hand, offer more safety, but don't have the same readymade presentation. If you get a box, index card dividers will act as a trusty partition between categories.Each of these index partitions will help you categorize the cards within each box. Sticky tabs may be used to the same effect in binders. \n If your cards are too valuable to be worth storing in basic binders, it may be worth it to buy high-protection plastic sleeves for each of the cards.This will reduce smudging and tear risks. Toploaders are recommended for the most hardcore, high-value collectors.Depending on the size of your collection, you may need multiple binders and boxes. If this is the case, you should try to turn each binder/box into a broad category.\n Most card brands offer prescribed categories. You may choose to follow these categories if you want. Otherwise, you can order them numerically (if applicable) or alphabetically. A numerical or alphabetical ordering system can be used within each category as well. \n Sports cards might be categorized by player type, team, year, set and the sport itself. Some collector choose to specialize in specific teams. Collecting all of the cards in a given team will increase your collection's value. \n Pokemon cards might be categorized by the particular card type or its rareness. Other "character" cards may be sorted according to the unique categories of that given product. \n For duplicate cards, you can place them side by side. For less valuable cards in binders, a common trick is to make the cards share the same sleeve. It is helpful to make a note somewhere that the duplicate exists, as it won't be readily visible from the start. \n Place each card in its assigned pile. Keep a healthy distance of space between certain piles. If you are dealing with enough cards, the piles may get big enough to the point where separate piles eventually merge. \n Once you have your card piles sorted out, it's time to list the categories listed in your box or binder. With a permanent marker, neatly list the category on a tab and place it at the beginning of a given category. It helps to have all of your categories planned out before you get to this stage. That way, you can allot enough space to each section in your storage. \n Though it may seem obvious, you should make a point of marking the box or binder itself. If you're storing them in your attic, they can get lost amidst a number of other things. \n There's a tendency for collectors to scribble the categories. While you obviously don't need to make the lettering perfect, it is a good idea to ensure the writing is legible for anyone who might see it. Furthermore, giving your lettering some creative flair might add to the aesthetic value of your collection. \n It's a good idea to count out the number of cards in each category before marking your sections. That way, you can give each category ample space in your binder. \n Put on a show or listen to music while you arrange the cards by type. This will make your time feel more worthwhile. Make a point of placing the cards in carefully. If your cards have a monetary worth associated with them, the slightest crease or tear could ruin their value. \n If you're a passionate collector, you'll always be on the lookout for new additions. With this in mind, it's good to organize your binder with future finds in mind. Leave some extra space at the end of each category to accommodate for this. \n If you're ordering within each category itself, you can save yourself organizing in the future by taking account of the cards you still need. If there's a limited amount needed to complete a collection, leave an open space where that card will eventually go. This also gives you a visual reference as to how complete your collection currently is. \n If your collection expands beyond the capacity of your given storage, it may be time to reorganize the collection. Luckily, with your cards already in their proper categories, reorganizing will only take a fraction of the original time it took to get things together. \n With that in mind, finding a spot where they'll be safe and untouched is paramount. A temperate basement or attic is a good place to store basic hobby cards for the long-term. More valuable cards should be kept somewhere heat and moisture controlled, like an office. Renting out a moisture-regulated lockup to keep your cards in is recommended if they're sufficiently valuable. If you want quick access to your collection, a filing cabinet is a good idea. Binders are more frail than boxes, and should be placed in a storage box if you're storing them for a long time. \n Make sure your basement or attic is free from excess issues like heat or moisture. If this is the case, you should store it somewhere more temperate, such as a bedroom closet. \n If you have to store your cards in a damp or hot area, you should invest in rigid snap-cases. This will protect your cards from most of the environmental issues. They can run up a cost if you need enough of them, but they're worth it if your cards are sufficiently valuable.If your collection carries some significant monetary weight, it's not unreasonable to lock it up in a safe. \n While a digital representation of your card collection may be redundant for smaller collections, it becomes increasingly useful once your collection crosses over into needing multiple boxes or binders. \n Make sure to include the essential card data, including the name, category, and estimated monetary value. Sports cards will indicate the maker of the card, the year, sport, player name, number, condition and whether or not the card itself is signed. Other card systems (such as "character" cards) should be catalogued according to each of that brands specific properties. \n There are software programs specifically designed for card-collecting. If a spreadsheet is too impersonal for your needs, you should look up a card organizing program., This offers a shorthand method of referring to certain cards. Again, this is a card-keeping method that only really makes sense if your collection gets really big. \n A lot of things factor into a card's market worth, including condition, rarity, desirability and historical significance. If you aren't sure of the values themselves, you can show them to trading card specialist. For a fee, a specialist will appraise the condition and rarity of a card and give you a rough estimate of its worth on the market. \n Having more than one card isn't usually seen as a particularly desirable, but a card copy can come in handy if you're trading with other collectors. With this in mind, it's a good idea to set aside the cards you want to trade. At a convention, you may run into another collector that has a card you want. By trading your duplicates for cards you want, you'll be able to get a solid use out of them. \n The longer you let your collection grow unchecked, the more harrowing it will be to ultimately get it in order.If you're starting out with a trading card collection, it's never too early to start sorting them out by type. As time goes on, your categories will get more elaborate. However, even a basic set of 5-10 cards can be arranged in a way that makes logical sense. \n 
 If it is a very personal problem it may be better solved by going to an advice center, or legal advice center if it is a legal problem. Not posting it on a forum.\n So if you do choose to post on a forum, if it is a personal problem you should choose a username that is different from your real name. But you may want to use a username that is different from your real name anyway. \n This can get you a warning from the moderators and you could also be banned from the forum for this. This may seem unfair, but a lot of admins are not interested in who started the argument. As far as they are concerned, if two people are both fighting and making the forum unpleasant, then one person is as guilty as the other one involved in the argument. So if someone is rude to you, ignore them. \n Just report that person to the admin or moderator. Many forums have a link you can click on, or means of contact for the forum admin that you can report that person to. This is a far better way of dealing with it that to be rude back to the member, even though they were rude to you. \n It is no good getting so worked up and upset that you get caught up in the argument, and that you end up posting hateful comments back to the members who are winding you up. And if you do this, you can end up being banned from the forum by the admin or moderators. \n Or you may have just got a nasty response from the members about what you posted on the forum. If this happens to you, DO NOT blow up at them by posting back swear words or hateful comments in order to get your own back at them. This will only make things worse and will also get you banned from the forum. Some forums will ban you permanently for this. \n A moderator or admin can lock the thread or delete the thread. This can be very upsetting when you have spent time and hours writing your posts. Only to have your thread locked or deleted by a moderator. If this happens to you DO NOT start another thread about the same topic that was locked or deleted. As that could get you a warning from the admin or moderator. And it can also get you banned from the forum. REMEMBER it is their website and they can do what they want. So they can lock your thread or the thread you are posting on. And they can delete the thread and there is nothing you can do about it. \n Is that forum right for you? Also think before you post. As everything you post will be public and read by everyone online. Is your post or topic right for the forum? Some forums will not allow some topics on their forum. So read the rules first. And if you are not sure about it, don't post it. \n This will make the admin more angry and they will ban your IP address. Then you won't be able to view the site at all. \n Forums forbid multiple accounts and will ban you for this. \n Or you could be banned from that forum as well. \n

 \n \n Remove the egg from the refrigerator just before adding, as the egg should be well-chilled. \n Too much mixing will result in doughy, non-crispy tempura. \n If you are making fish tempura, wash and debone the fish, then cut the fish into small chunks. If you are using shrimp in your tempura, the shrimp should be de-veined. \n Wash the vegetables thoroughly. \n Avoid soft vegetables, as soft vegetables will become soggy when the vegetables are deep-fried. \n Place the food in the refrigerator until you're ready to deep fry. \n Tempura batter should be kept cold while you work. \n This will add flavor to the food, and also wick away moisture, making the batter stick better. \n You can use nearly any type of oil, including canola, safflower, corn or peanut oil. However, avoid olive oil, which will alter the flavor of the tempura. If you are using a deep fat fryer, fill the fryer to the level recommended by the manufacturer. \n If you don't have a thermometer, heat the oil then drop about a pea-sized bit of batter into the oil. If the oil is hot enough, the batter will drop to the bottom before it sizzles and bounces quickly to the top of the oil. \n It is helpful to place your batter near the oil so you don't spill on the counter when moving it to the oil. \n Remember to place it in the oil gently so it does not splash. \n \n Cook the tempura until the batter is golden brown. \n
 If you don't want to wear gloves, be aware that your skin may stain, but you can still remove the Kool-Aid from it.\n Remember that Kool-Aid can stain fabric, so use an old towel or cloth. \n Be sure to use the unsweetened version, to avoid creating sticky hair. Moreover, don't use the artificially sweetened kind, as the chemicals might irritate your eyes. You may need to use more packages than recommended here, depending on the length of your hair, and how deep you want the color. Suggestions for suitable Kool-Aid matched to a hair shade change are: \n Tropical punch is great for a brighter red \n Cherry works for a deeper red \n Black-cherry mixed with strawberry works for a bright red \n Mixing strawberry and grape can make a purplish red \n Experiment with variations of your favorite Kool-Aid colors to get more unique colors \n Adding conditioner helps to make a paste, which is easier to handle. \n Keep mixing out all the lumps and liquidy areas. \n This is the fun part but you definitely need help for this if you're dyeing your own hair. \n All of your hair must be very damp and sticky, otherwise the powder will just wash out, without coloring your hair. \n You'll have to sleep in it, so do a good job! This step is important not just to protect your pillows and sheets, but because it will trap the moisture in, allowing for a deeper color change. It would be a good idea to wrap your pillow in an old towel in case the sandwich wrap moves around while sleeping. \n You can secure the plastic wrap carefully with tape. \n Don't be dismayed by the gruesome colours on your skin––everything washes off! See How to remove Kool-Aid from skin if you have skin stains. \n Do not shampoo! If you use shampoo, the color will wash straight out. Apply conditioner if wished, then rinse again. Then comb your hair out and wait for it to dry. The final tint will be less obvious with wet hair. \n Darker hair will change the tints of the hair color, but lighter hair can be dramatically changed! You may need to experiment with this a few times to get the balance right for your hair color –– just remember that the darker your natural hair, the less obvious the effects will be. \n Ensure that the foil does not come off. \n Remember, this is not a permanent hair dye. \n Remove from the heat and let it cool to room temperature. \n Then pull up a chair, sit back, and dip your hair ends in, let them sit in for different timings depending on how dramatic you want the color, how dark your hair is, and how long you want it to stay in. \n DO NOT wash with shampoo. If the color does not show up with your wet hair, do not worry. The color is not as visible with wet hair than dry hair. After rinsing your hair, blow dry it until dry. \n Wait 3-5 minutes for it to cool off. Add the unsweetened Kool Aid packets (two packets for blondes, three for brunettes). Stir it in. \n Put one section on each shoulder. \n Let it sit for 15-30 minutes, depending on how strong you want the color and how long you want it to last. Have a magazine or book to read while you're incapacitated over the bowl! (Or listen to music, a podcast or an audio book.) \n Then wash your hair with cold water and conditioner (conditioner is optional) You will see some Kool Aid start to drip off while washing but this is normal. \n You're now ready to rock the new dye! \n 
 Depending on the place, accommodation can go fast. Consider whether you are taking kids or pets, how far you want to drive, whether you want to camp or stay in a hotel, and whether you want to go somewhere popular or more secluded. Check if there's any upcoming concerts or shows in the area that you'd like to see.\n Focus on toning your stomach and legs. \n Take children's, hygiene, pet's and bedding requirements into consideration. Some beach houses have pillows etc. others don't. Check with the manager if you're unsure. A small first aid kit is handy, just in case. \n Take a beach ball, soccer ball, volleyball or beach cricket set if you want. \n Some water and snacks in a cooler bag are great if you stop for a picnic on the way. \n Familiarize yourself with shops, the way to the beach etc. \n It's best to sleep in light cotton clothing in the heat, and make sure there is protection from mosquitoes and/or flies when you're sleeping. They get really annoying and may carry disease in some places. \n Fresh orange juice can be wonderful on hot mornings. Perhaps you could go for a walk or run on the beach, go buy the paper, sunbathe, or catch some early morning breakers. \n Sunbathe, surf, boogie board, whale watch, whatever. \n \n Lots of tourist beaches have surfing lessons. These are great fun and a wonderful way to meet people. \n Beach towns have loads of surf shops, many with discount surf wear. \n Moisturize everyday, use shampoo, conditioner and treatment, visit a spa. \n

 It uses 4 screws and can be easily removed from the back of the monitor. This is shown by the red arrows in the picture.\n Remove the other 4 screws that are holding down the case. \n The monitor cover is made up of 2 plastic covers joined at the sides and in order to open you must force a separation. The picture shows that the screwdriver was placed in the middle of the covers and made a small space. The screen is held down by plastic locks around the screen and you will use the screwdriver to open these locks, this is why the slotted (Straight) screwdriver is mandatory. \n This step gets easier and easier as you progress, so if your having trouble starting don't worry it will get easier. \n This is the display panel signal cable. \n This is the control panel cable. This cable has a lock, so it must be pressed and taken out at the same time. \n this also has a lock and must be pressed to release. This four cables are the back light plugs. \n You must remove the power cable that is going to the driver board shown by the arrow. \n The capacitor list and location for this specific model is listed below. The locations should be listed on the board itself. \n Flip the power board and use the soldering iron to the metal stubs that relate with the capacitors that needs to be removed. This should create a new hole for the new capacitors to fit in. \n
 Research has shown that men are more likely than women to take jobs in which pay is dependent on outperforming their peers, and you probably know from personal experience that men tend to be more interested in sports (playing or watching).A lot of men act this way because they thrive on competition, and take satisfaction in having skills or traits that dominate others. If you're playing against him in a game, don't be surprised if his mood suddenly turns intense and merciless if he starts losing. Accept it with good humor and move on. \n Encourage his competitive hobbies. You'll notice that a lot of stereotypical men's activities - such as gaming, watching or playing sports, and extreme sporting - are focused on some element of competition. Because succeeding in competition can be more important to men, support the activities that can bring your guy this sort of satisfaction in a relatively safe way.\n Eyesight is one of the strongest senses, and processing all the things you may see takes up a large portion of day-to-day cerebral processing. Men, however, are even more apt than women to respond to visual cues.As a result, you might find that men prefer to view a map to understand directions over hearing the directions read, or they might insist that they need to see a problem in order to fix it. Try not to be annoyed at this tendency, and accept it as an inborn trait he may not know how to control. \n Don't be too offended if he looks at other women. Being more attentive to visual stimulus means that a guy might be more inclined to look - or even stare - at attractive people. But don't get bent out of shape - just because he looks at a woman in a low-cut shirt doesn't mean he automatically wants to sleep with her. These small glances are generally harmless, and are more of a reflex than an indication of a doomed relationship. \n Research indicates that this difference begins in childhood, when little girls form bonds by sharing secrets and discussing problems while boys bond over shared activities and interests . If you expect your boyfriend or husband to be like your best female conversation partner, only better, you might be surprised - men tend not to build strong relationships through conversation, and they switch topics more frequently than women do.In addition to this, men also don't make as much eye contact when they're talking to someone. Instead, their gazes wander to other objects in the immediate area as they talk. \n Instead of punishing him for this difference and complaining that he never listens to you, choose your battles. If you really want to discuss an important topic with a man, frame it in a way that doesn't leave him guessing. Say, "It's important to me that we talk about this, and it would mean a lot to me if you could listen closely." If he cares about you, he'll make the extra effort to up his participation to your level. \n Expect to hear a solution. Another side effect to the way men have conversations is that they tend to focus on how to fix a problem. If you just want a man to offer you comfort and reassurance instead of instructing you on what to do, tell him that at the beginning of the conversation. Remember that he's trying to help you find a solution because he cares, and that's what he thinks caring people do in a conversation, not because he wants to boss you around. \n Think of the old stereotype of a husband who has no idea what he's done to enrage his wife. It's possible that he's not just being deliberately clueless - he might genuinely have no idea why she's upset, or whether she's upset at all. Because women have more developed limbic systems, they're better at classifying and reading emotions, a skill that was useful when women were primarily in charge of maintaining social connections in ancient cultures. Men, on the other hand, lag behind women in studies of how the sexes identify and control emotions.Don't expect him to read your mind. If you're upset at a man, tell him in a way that's as calm and reasonable as possible. Once he's aware of how you feel, he can take measures to remedy the problem. If you don't tell him, though, you can't necessarily count on him to pick up your cues. \n Give him space. Because men aren't accustomed to discussing their personal problems at length with a buddy, you might find that they tend to process such problems on their own. If a man shuts down when you try to discuss his personal issues, back off gracefully and give him space to get over it. Most men will let you know if they want to talk about it. \n Studies show that men in seemingly platonic relationships with women are more likely to be attracted to their female friends, and also more likely to have the misguided belief that the women harbor sexual feelings for them. Though women have also shown signs of having sexual feelings for their male friends, they are more likely to back off when they know the men are in relationships; men are less deterred when their female friends have boyfriends and still show signs of wanting to pursue them.This doesn't mean, however, that every male friend you have really has a crush on you, deep down. \n Though men and women may be completing the same task or inhabiting the same office, men and women take a different approach to getting work done. Men tend to be more focused on completing a specific task while women are more focused about the process used to get the job done; women tend to ask more questions while men have a harder time listening. Both sexes, however, do feel that the oppose sex is not as sensitive to their needs in the workplace.Men and women tend to react differently in the workplace in terms of stress, too. While women may openly express concern about a failed project, men may retreat and seek solitude in the face of failure. \n Women and men also seek appreciation differently. Women are happier when they are complimented on a group task, while men like to be singled out. \n Though you may be convinced that your boyfriend, male friend, or male co-worker would want to sleep with every woman on the planet in an ideal world, that is not the case. Though men may look at the women around them and can have wandering eyes, they are still selective when the time comes to actually sleep with someone. \n If you're convinced that your boyfriend really wants to sleep with all women, then why are you together? If this is really a problem in your relationship because of who he is, then it's one thing, but if it's because you think it's because he's a man, then you have to rethink your ideas. \n Sure, you may have the occasional sleazy male friend. But remember that men may want to brag about how many women they like to sleep with to look tough; that doesn't mean they are interested in following through. \n You may think that your boyfriend hates it when it's your turn to pick the location and event for date night, but that's not actually true. Sure, your boyfriend may moan and groan when you make him watch Love Actually for the tenth time, but the truth is, he likes doing what you want to do because, well, it's what makes you happy. \n Remind yourself that if your boyfriend really didn't want to do something, he just wouldn't do it. And the same goes for you. \n Think of Tony Soprano: a tough guy on the outside and a big, soft, sensitive bear on the inside. It's true that women may like to be more open with their feelings and to talk more, but that doesn't mean that men aren't sensitive, don't have the ability to get hurt, and don't know how to sympathize or empathize. Men may be more resistant to showing emotion, but that doesn't mean that they don't have feelings that are just as big as yours. \n Men are not cavemen who are only obsessed with the basic necessities: food, sex, and sleep. Get this thought out of your mind. \n Sure, men may be more likely to think often about sex than women, especially if they're teenagers, but that doesn't mean that they only have one thing on their minds at all times. Just like anyone else, men spend time thinking about their friends, family, hopes and dreams, and career prospects. If a hot woman in heels walks by, then sure, they may be momentarily distracted, but that doesn't mean that the inside of his mind looks like the XXX section of your local video store. \n When it comes to looks, men and women can both be superficial. You may think that men only care about what a girl's body looks like, adding bonus points if she actually has a nice face, but that is not the case when men get serious about a girl. Don't think that all you have to do to impress a man is to hit the gym, put on the eyeliner, and wear tight pants. You have to impress him with your charm, your brains, and your ability to have a good conversation. \n Sure, some men are more obsessed with looks than they should be. But you can say the same for women. \n You may think that men are known for being cheaters; and who can forget the Tiger Woods scandal? However, both men and women are capable of cheating, even if women tend to look for more of an emotional connection while men look for the physical connection. Don't think that your guy is likely to cheat on you just because he's a guy; if he does, it's because he's looking for a connection outside the relationship.That doesn't mean that there aren't some real scumbags out there. But women could be scumbags, too. \n You may think that any man you meet is terrified of commitment and wants to run for the hills as soon as you say the phrase, "I think you should meet my parents." In reality, men are just as likely to commit as women. You're just thinking of the 20% of men who are true commitment-phobes. Just remember that there are plenty of women who are equally afraid of getting serious with someone. \n If your current love interest is afraid to commit to you, then don't tell yourself it's just because he's "a typical man." There are lots of other reasons for why a man may not want to commit, such as a lack of experience or the pain he suffered in a past relationship. \n Sure, men might be intimidated by strong women -- if you're Michelle Obama or Oprah Winfrey. But in general, men are actually attracted to assertive women who know what they want and are comfortable with going after it. Don't try to act girly, clueless, or giggly just to impress a guy. If you want a man to take you seriously, then you have to show him your full potential. \n Being strong means being confident. And everyone is attracted to confidence. \n If you want to understand men on an even deeper level, then you should try to understand the male ego. \n Mastering this process could improve your relationship in the long run. \n This can help you understand the thought process of a man who is in it for the long haul. \n This is a challenging aspect of understanding men. \n If you have a better sense of how to improve your relationship with your boyfriend, you'll have a better understanding of men. \n 
 You will need to be able to play something at least at a basic level. Please do not assume piano is the only way to go. Yes it is conventional, but many composers have begun their compositional careers on instruments such as the guitar, oboe and clarinet.\n the most powerful scale tool musicians have is the diatonic modes, which are just scales, starting on different root notes. You should also understand scales and chords and remember them. \n Take a class in high school or college, or even teach yourself via the internet. You will need the knowledge regardless of how you learn it. \n Be creative! \n Some helpful things to look up for an accompaniment would be chord progressions and scale knowledge. Remember that music theory was made so each musician wouldn't have to experiment as much when making music. \n Know which instruments fit into the category of music (e.g. String Quartet ~ 2 violins, viola, cello; Brass Quintet: 2 trumpets, horn, trombone, tuba). \n Play by ear. Play things and see if they sound good together. If you want to be able to play the same thing again later, try using a MIDI keyboard. It can be hooked up to a computer, and will print your notes onto sheet music for you. A good computer composing program is Audacity \n This takes a lot of practice and dedication, but is a great composing tool. \n Write the note combinations that sound good to your ear. With guitar, write down the chords and guitar lines you play. It will help you to be familiar with music so you can name the chords and know the notes/scales that should be played along with the chord. \n Just like a written composition in English class, music requires multiple revisions before the final piece is ready. Build off your melody. The best thing here is to use your imagination. Don't forget about dynamics, expressions, or articulation. for more ideas. \n This is an extremely useful technique that will rapidly improve the sound of your piece. \n Try to think where the listener will become bored, and be brutal with your judgments. Also, read up on musical forms. \n Often you will find they are more willing than you assume. \n It is a defining feature of common practice era music, and will make your piece sound really amazing. 
 Assertive communication carries respect for the feelings, needs, wants, and opinions of others. An assertive communicator avoids infringing upon the rights of others, while asserting their own, seeking compromise in the process. Assertive communication utilizes actions and words to express boundaries of needs and wants in a calm fashion, while conveying a message of confidence., The verbal cues that indicate assertive communication convey respect, sincerity and firmness. These cues might include:Firm, relaxed voice \n Fluent and sincere \n Appropriate volume for situation \n Cooperative and constructive \n Just like verbal cues, non-verbal communication conveys assertive behavior and can indicate respect, sincerity and confidence. Non-verbal features might include:Receptive listening \n Direct eye contact \n Open body stance \n Smiling when pleased \n Frowning when angry \n An assertive person will naturally gravitate towards certain thought patterns that indicate their confidence and respect for others. These thoughts might include:“I won’t be taken advantage of, or attack another person.” \n “I will stand up for myself in a respectful manner.” \n “I will express myself directly and openly.” \n Assertiveness can often be incorrectly confused with aggression. Aggressiveness lacks respect for others. It is a complete disregard for the needs, feelings, wants, opinions, and sometimes even the personal safety of other people. Aggressive communication can often be identified by angry and/or demanding behavior, self-promotion, and manipulation. \n Verbal features of aggressive communication might include: sarcastic or condescending remarks, blaming, shouting, threats, boasting, or the use of put-downs. \n Nonverbal features of aggressive communication might include: intruding upon others’ personal space; fist-clenching, crossed arms, scowling, or staring down another person. \n Thoughts associated with aggressive communication might include: “I feel powerful, and will get others to do my bidding," "I am in control of other people," or "I refuse to be vulnerable.” \n Silence and assumption are the hallmarks of the passive communication style. Passive communicators often lack of respect for themselves, disregarding their own opinions, feelings, needs, and desires. Passive communication places one’s own needs and desires below those of others. Passivity takes away one’s power and allows others to decide the outcomes of situations.: \n Verbal features of passive communication might include: hesitancy, quiet, self-dismissal, or self put-downs. \n Non-verbal features of passive communication might include: averting the gaze or looking down, slouched posture, crossed arms, or covering the mouth with hand. \n Thoughts associated with passive communication might include: “I don’t count," or “People will think poorly of me.” \n From early childhood, our behaviors are adapted to fit responses received from our environment, families, peers, coworkers, and authority figures. Communication styles, such as passiveness, assertiveness, and aggression, can be extensions of cultural, generational, and situational influences. Assertiveness is much more valued in Western societies. \n Older generations may find it more difficult to act assertively. Men were once taught that emotional expression was a sign of weakness, while women were taught that stating their own needs and opinions conveyed messages of aggression. Sometimes, it can even be difficult for us to discern which behaviors are appropriate to use in different situations., It is important not to blame yourself if you do not understand how to communicate assertively. Other types of communication styles, such as passiveness and aggression, can be parts of a vicious cycle. You can break this cycle by learning new assertive ways of thinking and behaving.If your family taught you to place the needs of others before yourself as a child, it may be difficult for you to assert yourself. \n If your family or peer group handled conflict by yelling and arguing, you may have learned to deal with conflict accordingly. \n If your social group believed that negative emotions should be concealed, or if your have ever been ignored or ridiculed for expressing these types of feelings, then you may have learned not to communicate negative emotions. \n In order to learn how to communicate assertively, it is important that you learn how to effectively manage your emotions. For some, just gaining insight into their own emotional processes can be enough to help them change the way they communicate with others and enable them to express their emotions in a more assertive manner. Keeping a journal can be the best to get to the bottom of your behavior, by recording situations and asking specific questions that relate to assertiveness., Write down situations that trigger your emotions. Stick to facts and try not to make any interpretations in this first step. For example, you may simply write, “I asked my friend to go out to eat, and she said ‘no’.” \n Be honest about how you felt. Specify what emotions you were aware of at the time, and rate the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 100 (not intense at all to extremely intense). Just give an estimate but be honest with yourself. \n Note any physical symptoms you may have felt at the time. Ask yourself, “What did I do?” and “What did I feel in my body?” \n For example, if someone ignored your phone call, maybe you felt sick to your stomach or tension in your shoulders. \n These thoughts may be assumptions, interpretations, beliefs, values, and so forth. Ask yourself, “What was I thinking?” or “What was going through my head?” For instance, you may write down: “I agreed to go out to eat when she asked me, so she should have said yes when I asked her,” or “Saying no was rude of her,” or “Maybe she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore.” \n Again using the 0 to 100 scale, rate the strength of your thoughts in the situation. Record a “0” if you didn’t believe the thought, or a “100” if you believed it 100%. Then ask yourself, “Am I thinking in a passive, assertive, or aggressive manner?” Record your response to this question. Record any evidence for, or against, each thought. Evaluate whether there may be other ways to interpret the situation. \n In order to find a more balanced and assertive manner of thinking and behaving, ask yourself, “What would be a more assertive way of thinking or responding?” \n After you have evaluated the situation, revisit the intensity of your original emotions and the strength of your beliefs in the situation. Rate them again from 0 to 100. \n Through the journaling exercise, you are likely to decrease the intensity of your emotions. Evaluate your emotions, thoughts, and reactions during different types of situations. If you continue to practice, you may begin to think and behave in a more assertive manner. \n Assertiveness is a learned style of communication that allows for the confident expression of one’s needs and feelings while, at the same time, remaining mindful of the opinions, wants, needs, and feelings of others. It is an alternative to behaving in a passive or aggressive manner. There are many benefits to learning how to communicating assertively:Strong and effective communication \n Confidence \n Self-esteem enhancement \n Gain respect of others \n Improves decision-making skills \n Reduces stress of not having needs met \n Enables conflict resolution \n Self-respect increases \n Feelings of being ignored or coerced replaced by feelings of being understood and in control of decisions \n Tendency to be less depressedDecreased likelihood of substance abuse, Saying no can be difficult for many people. However, saying “yes” when you need to say “no” can lead to unnecessary stress, resentment, and anger toward others. When saying no, it can be helpful to keep in mind a useful set of guidelines:Keep it brief. \n Be clear. \n Be honest. \n For example, if you don't have time to do a favor that you don't have time to do, you can simply say, "I can't this time. Sorry to disappoint you, but I have too many things to do that day, and there's no room in my schedule." \n When you are speaking with someone, remain calm and have respect for them. This will enable the other person to heed what you say and treat you with respect too. \n It may help to breathe deeply if you start to feel upset. Doing so will initiate your body's calming process and help you stay in control. \n Communication may seem like a simple task, however, much of what we attempt to communicate to others – and what is communicated to us – can often be misunderstood. This may cause frustration or conflict in our relationships with other people. When communicating with someone, state your feelings, wants, opinions, and needs in simple sentences. This will help the other person clearly understand what you’re asking.For example, instead of speaking to a family member in long sentences full of hints and indirect statements, you can be brief and direct: "I love when you call me just to talk! It's hard for me to have a long conversation during work hours, though. I'd appreciate it if you called during the evening instead." \n “I” statements convey that you are willing to take responsibility for your own thoughts and behaviors. There are different types of “I” statements that are appropriate for a variety of situations:Basic assertion: This type of “I” statement can be used in everyday situations to make your needs known, or to give praise, information, or facts. Basic assertions can also be utilized in self-disclosure situations to ease anxiety and enable relaxation. It includes: “I need to leave by 6 o’clock,” or “I enjoyed your presentation.” \n Empathetic assertion: This particular “I” statement contains elements of recognition of another person’s feelings, needs, or desires, as well as a statement of your own needs and desires. It can be used to indicate your sensitivity to another person’s position, such as, “I know you are busy, but I need your assistance.” \n Consequence assertion: This is the strongest form of “I” statement, often used as a last resort assertion. It can be misinterpreted as aggressive if you are not careful to observe your non-verbal behavior. The consequence assertion informs another person of the penalties for not changing their behavior; usually in situations when someone is not considering the rights of others. An example would be a work situation when procedures or guidelines are not being followed: “If this happens again, I am left with no choice but to pursue disciplinary action. I would prefer to avoid that.” \n Discrepancy assertion: This type of “I” statement is used to point out a discrepancy between what has been previously agreed upon, and what is actually happening. It is used for clarifying misunderstandings and/or contradictions in behavior. You might say, “As I understand, we agreed that Project ABC was our number one priority. Now you are asking me to allow more time for Project XYZ. I would like you to clarify which is now the top priority.” \n Negative feelings assertion: This form of “I” statement is utilized in situations where you feel negative feelings toward another person (anger, resentment, hurt). It enables you to convey these feelings without making an uncontrolled outburst, and alerts the other party of the effects of their actions. You might say, “When you procrastinate on your report, it involves my working over the weekend. I feel annoyed by this, so in the future I would like to receive it by Thursday afternoon.” \n Always remember when being assertive, your non-verbal communication is important. It is possible to think you are acting assertively when you are actually being passive or aggressive because you are not careful about your non-verbal communication style. \n Keep your voice calm and volume neutral \n Maintain good eye contact \n Relax your face and body position \n Adopting assertive behavior takes time and practice so that it can become second nature to you. Practice having conversations in the mirror. Alternately, practice your conversation with your therapist or counselor. \n It can be challenging to keep your emotions under control, which can affect the way we communicate. When we get stressed or upset, our bodies go into stress mode, which puts our bodies into a chemical and hormonal reaction to get ready for a perceived threat.The way you think in this state is different than the way you would think with a calm, clear, rational mind and body, making it more difficult for you to use your assertiveness techniques.Acknowledge when you have stress in your life. Make a list of the things that are contributing to your stressful state. \n Relaxation techniques bring our bodies back to a balanced physiological state. For example, meditation has a calming effect on the brain that lasts well after your meditation session. This has a direct effect on the amygdala, the center in the brain responsible for emotional reasoning.Try to meditate every day for at least 5-10 minutes.Sit in a comfortable chair or on a pillow. \n Close your eyes and focus on sensations that you’re having. Pay attention to what you feel with your body, what you hear, and what you smell. \n Turn your attention to your breathing. Inhale for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four. \n Whenever your mind wanders, dismiss the thoughts without judgment and refocus your thinking on your breath. \n You might add a mantra or metta, or a saying that uplifts you and gives you positive feelings, such as, “May I be peaceful,” or “May I be happy.”You might also try a guided meditation, which helps you visualize relaxing imagery., When you are in a stressful situation, deep breathing can help reduce stress and help you think clearly. Take some deep breaths by slowly and deliberately inhaling and exhaling. \n Sit comfortably in a chair with your arms and legs uncrossed, feet flat on the floor, and hands resting on your thighs. Gently close your eyes. \n Breathe in through your nose, observing the quality of the breath while inhaling and exhaling. \n Slowly lengthen each inhalation by smoothly deepening each breath down into your abdomen. Pause briefly, then note the smooth, steady breath released as you exhale. \n Begin counting the rhythm of your breaths. Inhale for 3 seconds. Exhale for 3 seconds. Maintain slow, even, and controlled breathing. Try not to speed up. \n Use this rhythm while breathing for 10-15 minutes \n When finished, gently open your eyes. Relax momentarily. Then, slowly rise from the chair. \n If you’re nervous about meditation or feel you don’t have the time to practice it faithfully, the relaxation response can still be activated through progressive muscle relaxation.This technique activates the body’s calming response and brings the body back into physiological balance by tensing and relaxing each muscle group in the body in progression. To practice progressive muscle relaxation in about 15-20 minutes per day: \n Find a comfortable position in a chair with your feet flat on the floor, your hands resting on your thighs, and your eyes closed. \n Start the exercise by clenching your fists, holding for 10 seconds. Then release, feeling the relaxation sensation for another 10 seconds. Repeat. \n Tense your lower arm by bending your hand downward at the wrist, hold for 10 seconds. Release, and relax for another 10 seconds. Repeat. \n Work through the rest of your body, pausing to tense and relax each muscle group. Start with your upper arms, shoulders, neck, head, and face. Then continue with your chest, stomach, back, buttocks, thighs, calves and feet. \n When you’ve worked through your entire body, sit for a few minutes to enjoy the sensation of feeling relaxed. \n Stand slowly to avoid dizziness (blood pressure drops when relaxed) or tensing up again unexpectedly. \n If you don’t have 15-20 minutes to complete the entire exercise, you can practice on muscle groups that are noticeably tense. \n Making decisions is part of being assertive. You are taking control of your life and making decisions that best suit you, rather than letting someone else make decisions for you or allow yourself to become swayed by someone else against your better judgment. By identifying the problem, you will be able to address critical elements that result in good decision-making. Niagara Region Public Health recommends using the IDEAL model:I – Identify the problem. \n D – Describe all possible solutions. These might include handling it yourself, asking for intervention from someone else, or doing nothing. \n E - Evaluate the consequences of each solution. Evaluate your feelings and needs to determine the best outcome for yourself. \n A - Act. Choose a solution and try it. Use “I” statements to express your feelings and needs. \n L - Learn. Did the solution work? Evaluate why or why not. If it didn’t work, look at the other solutions on your list and work through them. \n There may be multiple parties who will be impacted by a decision, but not all of them necessarily have to be involved with the decision-making. Get input from those who need to be involved.You should consider the other parties as you make your decision, but the final say will come from you. \n All decisions are prompted by the need for some course of action. Take time to determine the purpose behind this course of action. This will ensure that the decision is the correct one. \n Procrastination can be a major impediment to assertive decision-making. Don’t leave the decision to the last minute or you may eliminate some of the possible solutions., Boundaries are the physical, emotional, and intellectual barriers that you create to protect yourself from harm. Healthy boundaries protect your personal space, self-esteem, and maintain your ability to separate your own feelings from those of others. Unhealthy boundaries increase your likelihood of exposure to being adversely affected by others feelings, beliefs, and behaviors., When you go into a conversation where you want to discuss your needs, it’s important to know your boundaries beforehand. Having your boundaries at the forefront of your mind before a conversation will keep you from getting derailed and compromising your needs in the middle of a conversation because it's easier or helps you avoid conflict. \n For example, establish a boundary with your boss of not working on the weekends or not working overtime without three days’ notice. If you're talking to a friend, have a boundary of not picking her up at the airport again until she picks you up when you need a ride. \n If you do not feel right doing something, then don't do it. It's okay to reject someone. Remember, for yourself, the most important person is you. If you don't respect your own desires, how can you expect others to? \n You may think that being a people-pleaser will put you on people’s good side, but unfortunately, an overabundance of generosity usually has the opposite effect on people. \n People only value the things they invest time/energy/money into, so if you’re the one doing all the giving, your esteem for that person will skyrocket, but theirs for you will decline. Take a stand. People may resist at first – or even be shocked by your transformation – but in the end, they will respect you for it. \n Don't be silent if you have something to say. Share your feelings freely: it's your right. Remember, there's nothing wrong in having an opinion. Just make sure you pick the right moment to state your needs. Make it clear that what you have to say is important and should be noticed. \n Practice in low-stakes situations. Do all your friends love that new TV show everyone’s talking about? Don’t be afraid to admit that you weren’t all that impressed. Has someone misinterpreted what you said? Don’t nod and play along; explain what you really meant, even if the miscommunication was harmless. \n Identify what makes you happy and what your needs are. This will help you develop a set of expectations for other people to follow in how you would like to be treated. Think of situations where you don’t feel like you’re being treated with mutual respect or situations where you felt like your feelings were not being considered. Then consider what could happen to make you feel more respected., Acting confidently won’t do you any good if you can never make up your mind or are trying too hard to “go with the flow.” People will be accommodating to your needs if you can tell them clearly what those needs are. \n Off-loading decision-making onto everyone else is a passive-aggressive way of shirking your responsibility – and placing the consequences squarely on someone else’s shoulders. The next time your friends ask you where you want to go to dinner, don’t respond with, “Oh, wherever”; give them a concrete answer. \n A good approach is to adopt a “we” mentality and come up with solutions that will make both parties happy, if the situation allows. This way, everyone’s feelings are being considered and heard.For instance, if you drive your roommate to work every day, yet she doesn’t pay for gas, approach her about this issue. You can say, “I don’t mind giving you rides every so often. Owning a car is really expensive, though, and I am saving you money and time if you were to take the bus to work every day. Would you mind chipping in for gas every week? I’d really appreciate it.” In this way, you are acknowledging that she might not realize that you feel a certain way. Now she is aware of the problem without you using an accusing tone. \n Self-confidence is reflected by your ability to understand how you see yourself. This includes your self-perception and where you believe you fit in the social hierarchy. If you see yourself in a negative light, you might experience great difficulty asserting your own thoughts, beliefs, needs, and feelings. Furthermore, you may feel intimidated or reluctant to ask questions when you need clarification, focus too heavily on your own negative traits, and lack trust in yourself. Self-doubt prevents assertive communication. Assess your self-confidence through self-evaluation by asking yourself these questions:Can you maintain eye contact when communicating with others? \n Do you project your voice properly? \n Do you speak confidently (without using the phrases “uh” or “um” frequently)? \n Is your physical posture or stance erect and open? \n Do you have the ability to ask questions when clarification is needed? \n Are you comfortable around other people? \n Are you able to say no when appropriate? \n Are you able to express anger and annoyance appropriately? \n Do you offer your opinion when in disagreement with others? \n Do you defend yourself against mistakes that are not your fault? \n If you answered no to 3 or fewer of these questions, you are likely a self-assured individual. If you answered no to 4-6 of these questions, there is a significant chance that you see yourself negatively. If you answered no more to than 7 questions, you are likely to experience tremendous difficulty with self-confidence. You may often doubt your worthiness of respect or see yourself lower in the social hierarchy. \n The way you hold yourself speaks volumes about you – long before you even get a chance to open your mouth. Keep your shoulders squared and your chin up. Avoid fidgeting (put your hands in your pockets if you must) or covering your mouth when you speak. Look people in the eye when you speak to indicate that you don't intend to be brushed off. \n Try not to be easy to read, especially if you are nervous or uncertain. Hide your “tells” by controlling your hands, feet, and facial expressions so that they don’t betray your emotions. \n If making eye contact is a problem, practice with sunglasses and then work up to doing it barefaced. If you must avert your gaze, look off into the distance as if in thought, not down. \n Even if you are nervous or confused, you can still act confident. There's no shame in asking questions. \n Rushing when you talk is an admission that you don’t expect people to take the time to listen. Speaking slowly, on the other hand, will indicate to people that you’re worth the wait. Use a clear, calm voice. You don't need to be loud, but you do need to make yourself heard. \n If people aren't noticing you, say "Excuse me" clearly and firmly. Don’t be apologetic when you haven’t done anything wrong, as this can communicate to people that you feel slightly embarrassed just for existing. \n Try to be concise when you speak. Even the most confident person in the world will lose their audience if they don’t make their point soon enough. \n Avoid saying um or like as much as you can when you're trying to make a strong statement. Make a conscious effort to get these words out of your vocabulary. \n Shallow though it may be, people make snap judgments based on your appearance. People who are naturally confident and charismatic can change others’ minds, but the rest of us aren’t so lucky. If you're wearing clothes that look like you've just got out of bed, or if you wear a pound of make-up with fluffy high-heels, the average person won't take you seriously. On the other hand, if you look like you're ready to get things done, people will tend to be more respectful. \n Dressing well doesn’t necessarily mean dressing up. If you’re the naturally casual sort, focus on having clean, matching, unwrinkled clothes with no embarrassing slogans or inappropriate images. \n Making an effort to be serious about your appearance will make it look like you're more serious about your demands. \n This may sound silly, but if you want to project confidence, then you should sound firm and decisive when the moment comes. What better way to get there than to practice? You can practice in front of the mirror, into a recording, or even with a trusted friend, pretending he or she is your boss, significant other, or whomever you plan to speak with. \n When the moment comes, remember how confident you sounded when you were just rehearsing, and work to sound even more confident when it counts. \n If you feel you still need help becoming assertive, it can help to see a professional. Counselors and psychologists have education and training specifically in helping people communicate in healthy and meaningful ways., Many universities offer assertiveness training to the students.This will help you practice assertiveness techniques while helping you discuss different situations where you feel you need help in being assertive, as well as help in controlling your stress as you navigate different situations. \n Asserting yourself takes practice and time. Ask a friend to help you practice your communication skills in various scenarios. The more you face situations that demand assertiveness, even when they are mock situations, the more confident you will become. \n

 In this type of legal action, a large group of people (the plaintiffs) file a single lawsuit against a company or individual, (the defendant) for similar or identical grievances. All of the people who participate in a class action lawsuit share similar circumstances, injuries, and damages.Filing a class action lawsuit eliminates each person from having pay a lawyer to file a separate lawsuit. \n Specific individuals are named as the lead plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit, who have claims that like those of the other plaintiffs involved in the suit. \n The people who are plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit are collectively referred to as the class. \n Typically, there are at least 30 people involved in order to justify a class action lawsuit. However, there is no minimum number of plaintiffs required to file a class action lawsuit. \n Common class action lawsuits may involve people who took a certain drug that has a bad side effect or people who bought a certain product that caused injuries.\n A plaintiff in a class action lawsuit must have had the same or similar experience with the defendant as other members of the class. The evidence against the defendant must be similar for everyone in the class. A class action is only appropriate when individual lawsuits, even by multiple people, against the defendant would not be efficient or cost-effective for the court system., While all class action lawsuits follow the same general rules and procedures, the subject of these lawsuits can differ widely. There are four basic types of class action lawsuits: \n Securities class actions are brought on behalf of a group of investors or stockholders who have been injured as a result the improper conduct of a business. For example, the improper conduct at issue might include misstating the company’s earnings, concealing or misrepresenting risks that the company is taking, or otherwise engaging in or hiding illegal activity. \n Products liability or personal injury class actions generally are filed when a defective product, such as a drug with harmful side effects, or a mass accident, such as a toxic chemical spill, harms a large group of people. \n Consumer class actions may occur when many consumers are injured by a company’s illegal business practices. Some common examples of this type of lawsuit involve illegal charges on bills, illegal penalties for late payments, and failure to comply with consumer protection laws, like the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. \n Employment class actions typically are brought on behalf of employees of a company for violations of labor laws, such as wage laws, laws related to a safe working environment, and illegal employment discrimination. \n This kind of suit does not technically become a class action lawsuit until the judge finds that it meets all the requirements of a class action lawsuit. The judge then must formally certify the suit as a class action lawsuit before any further action can take place., If there is already an existing class action lawsuit, you may be able to simply join the class. You often will receive a written notice by mail informing you that you have been named as part of a class in a class action lawsuit. If so, you can simply follow the instructions in the notice in order to participate. \n In most cases, you do not have to do anything to participate in the case. This is the case, for instance, if you are part of a class who purchased a certain product that later was found to be defective. \n If you are a class member who was seriously injured by a defective product, however, you may want to take a more active role in the class action lawsuit by attending settlement discussions with other class members and the attorneys for the class. \n If you don’t want to participate in the case, you have to take some action to opt out, which typically is to provide written notice that you want to opt out. You may choose to opt out if you would rather bring your own lawsuit rather than participate in the class action lawsuit. If you don’t opt out, you cannot bring your own lawsuit against the defendant. \n Sometimes, you might think that you should be included in a class, but you don’t receive a written notice. If this is the case, you may be able to join it if you qualify. You can even search a database online for pending class actions by clicking here.If you have the same injuries that were caused by the same defendant as the other class members, you have the right to join the class. \n Look online for information on the class. In many cases, there will be a website that gives you information about the class action lawsuit, including how to join the class. \n Research public records for pending law suits regarding similar complaints or grievances. \n If you see an advertisement in a newspaper or magazine about a class action lawsuit, you can call the number in the advertisement to get more information on joining the class. \n You typically will join the class by contacting the attorney for the class. The attorney will investigate your situation and determine whether your injury and situation are similar enough to the other class members. \n A class action lawsuit is typically started by one or more people who feel that they have been treated wrongly by a defendant, which is usually a company or business. You will need a group of people together to approach an attorney about filing a class action lawsuit on your behalf.Take steps to identify other people who have the same complaint as you about the defendant. Although there is no certain number of people required to file a class action lawsuit, there are generally about 30 people who have been injured by the same defendant in the same way in order for a class action lawsuit to be practical and cost-effective. \n Check with friends and others in your network to see if others share your desire to file a class action lawsuit. \n Advertise in publications to find others who might have similar complaints or grievances and an interest in joining in the class action lawsuit. \n The materials that might support a class action lawsuit include receipts, deeds, correspondence and other official papers of significance. Your attorney will want to have copies of any such evidence, and the attorney for the defendant may request it, as well., Since these suits are complex, he or she must have a significant amount of experience representing plaintiffs in class action lawsuits. These types of lawsuits are often the subject of newspaper articles, as they are big lawsuits that tend to be well-publicized. \n If there is no class action lawsuit attorney in your area, contact those who are closest to your area and who seem to handle similar sorts of cases. A class action attorney may be willing to travel to you for a consultation, as class action lawsuits can be very lucrative for a lawyer, as well. \n If the attorney has handled only securities class action lawsuits in the past, then you probably shouldn’t hire him or her for a personal injury class action lawsuit. Choose an attorney who has specific experience handling class action lawsuits of this kind. \n This means that the attorney will not charge you any attorney fees up front in order to file your suit. You won’t have to pay the attorney any fees until you recover damages from the defendant. However, you will still be responsible for any costs that the attorney incurs in filing your suit, such as the court’s filing fee. \n In some cases, the attorney will advance the filing fee and other costs of the case if the plaintiffs cannot afford to pay the costs. The attorney will then seek reimbursement of these fees after the suit is finished. \n Many attorneys offer free consultations, which allows you to evaluate them and you find an attorney with whom you are comfortable. \n Once the attorney has filed the lawsuit, the judge will determine if the suit qualifies as a class action lawsuit. If so, the judge will certify the class who has filed the lawsuit. This is the first step in a class action lawsuit. , Since class action lawsuits are almost always very costly and complicated, the vast majority of class action lawsuits end in a settlement. In very large cases involving thousands of plaintiffs, the settlement amount may be rather small for those who did not actually experience any serious injuries. For those who are injured, however, the settlement amount may be much greater.In many cases, the defendant may simply be unable to pay enough to compensate all of the plaintiffs fully. The defendant may have to come up with as much money as it can pay, and the class members will have to agree to split the money as fairly as possible. \n The judge often will appoint a special master to help the parties reach a settlement. Usually, a special master is an experienced lawyer or mediator who will work with the class members, the attorneys, and the defendant to come up with a settlement agreement. \n If your class action lawsuit settles, as most do, a judge will have to approve the settlement before the class will receive any money from the defendant. Even if the case does not settle, damages must be calculated prior to going to trial so that the attorney knows how much compensation to request from the defendant.Mass torts involving products liability or personal injuries. \n Securities class action lawsuits. \n Class actions to stop discriminatory conduct. \n Establishment of a damages fund for future victims \n The judge presiding over the class action lawsuit may create a litigation plan for the case if it is particularly large or complex. The particulars of this plan will vary widely based on the suit and the judge who is creating it. For instance, a judge will sometimes bifurcate, or split, the issues into two or more separate trials, if it would be logical to do so. \n Every type of lawsuit involves some time of exchange of information and evidence between the two sides to the dispute. A class action lawsuit, given its nature and magnitude, will necessarily involve extensive amounts of discovery. Discovery may include the following actions: \n Taking depositions, which allow attorneys to ask questions of the parties and other witnesses while under oath. \n Answering interrogatories, which are written questions that the parties often must answer. \n Replying to requests for production of documents, which require a party to turn over copies of certain documents, such as medical records. \n If the parties cannot reach a settlement, the case must proceed to a trial. The trial can be in front of the judge, or the defendant can request a jury trial., If the suit will involve a jury trial, the attorneys for both sides of the dispute will take turns picking jurors from a pool of available jurors who have been called for jury duty. Each attorney will have the chance to ask the court to excuse some jurors from the trial. \n The process of choosing a jury is referred to as voir dire. The purpose of voir direct is to determine if any juror has a personal interest in the case or a prejudice that may wrongfully influence him or her during the trial. \n Give an opening statement. The plaintiff’s attorney gets to go first and introduce the case to the jury. The defendant’s attorney then has the same chance to do so. Each side will tell the jury what the case is about and what the evidence will prove. \n First, the plaintiff’s attorney will call different witnesses to the stand and question them about the dispute. This is referred to as direct examination. After the direct examination of each witness, the defendant’s attorney will also question the witness, in a process referred to as cross-examination. Next, the defendant’s attorney will call his or her witnesses, and the plaintiff’s attorney, likewise, will have the chance to cross-examine them. \n Witnesses may include parties to the case, such as the some of the named class members, or expert witnesses, such as doctors or accountant. The nature of any expert witnesses will depend on the type of class action lawsuit that is involved. \n Each side’s attorney will end the case by giving his or her closing argument, which summarizes the trial and the evidence. It is the last chance that an attorney will have to address the judge and jury. \n After deliberating, or meeting to discuss the decision that it will make, the jury will announce its verdict. The jury decides if the defendant is financially responsible for the plaintiffs' injuries, and to what extent it is responsible. \n 
 There are a number of medicines that are available to purchase over the counter that will help stomach aches. However it is important that you take the right medicine for the right symptoms. Before purchasing a medicine, consult a doctor or pharmacist and follow labels exactly.

Also, antacids containing magnesium can cause diarrhea. \n Read labels carefully. Adult Pepto Bismol, Kaopectate, bismatrol, and and some other drugs marketed for heartburn contain bismuth subsalicylate. Like aspirin, this drug can cause a dangerous condition called Reye's syndrome in children and teens. Do not take it without a prescription, especially if you might have the flu or another virus., Generally this means less than three bowel movements per week. Constipation is relatively common, but for some it can cause stomach pain and discomfort. A laxative or stool softener can help relieve discomfort.Check with your doctor or pharmacist on which medication to try. \n If your constipation continues for three weeks or longer call your doctor to schedule an appointment. You should also call your doctor if you begin to lose weight or see blood in your stool., Chose one of these medicines and begin taking it, as instructed on the bottle, as soon as bleeding or cramping starts.If these medicines do not work, your doctor will be able to prescribe a stronger medicine for you. \n There are several options to chose from.

You should drop the tea bag in hot, but not boiling, water, so as not to destroy chamomile's active ingredient. \n Mint tea is a useful remedy for gas, bloating, and indigestion because it works to relax stomach muscles. Peppermint tea is available at most supermarkets, but you can also use fresh mint leaves. Simply drop the leaves in hot water and let them sit for five to 10 minutes. Enjoy this drink after meals for best effect. \n Make yourself a rice tea. Rice tea is simply rice, water and honey. Boil half a cup of rice in six cups of water for 15 minutes. Next strain the rice out of the water, saving the water in a bottle. Add a small amount of sugar or honey to the water and drink warm. Rice tea has been shown to help settle upset stomachs., Yogurt can help speed up digestion because it contains active cultures. Mix yogurt with fruit juice for a healthy snack that will aid digestion. Try one part yogurt, one part juice. \n Carrot, apple, and peach drinks work well for indigestion. Avoid acidic fruits such as orange juice, as they can be harsh on an upset stomach. \n Yogurt labels will note if they contain active cultures. Be sure to only buy those with active cultures if you are using it to help with a stomach ache. \n Try mixing a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with one cup of warm water and a tablespoon of honey. This will help to reduce cramping, gas, and even heartburn., Ginger has been used for thousands of years to settle stomachs. Studies have shown that it is the anti-inflammatory properties in ginger that are so effective. Ginger can be taken fresh, in ginger capsules, ginger chews, or as ginger ale., For maximum effectiveness the pad or bottle should be around 104 °F or 40 °C. The heating pad or hot water bottle works by activating heat receptors deep in the body which, in turn, cause your body to not feel as much pain.This treatment is particularly recommended for menstrual pain. \n Each body is different, so it can be difficult to give general advice about what foods should be avoided. When you eat a certain food, pay attention to how you feel afterwards. By doing this you will soon be able to pinpoint what food or foods are causing problems. Talk to your doctor to see if you may have an allergy to a certain food, gluten sensitivity, or celiac disease. Be particularly mindful about the following foods: \n Processed foods, including fast food, white bread, sausage, donuts, hamburgers, and potato chips. \n Dairy products can cause stomach aches in some people, especially if they are unknowingly lactose intolerant. Try staying off dairy products for a week to see if there is improvement, or try a soy based milk.Spicy and greasy food can irritate the stomach and should be avoided if you are experiencing stomach pains. \n The best foods to help with a stomach ache are high in fiber. Your stomach aches may actually be caused by a lack of fiber in your diet. It is also important that you drink water, approximately two to three liters per day (nine to 13 cups) is the recommended amount.Foods high in fiber include fruits like bananas, vegetables like broccoli, and many whole grains. Prunes, cherries, raisins, and apricots are particularly effective. These foods will help with regular bowel movements and prevent constipation. \n Healthy foods like beans, broccoli, cabbage, and yogurt make gas in your stomach and can cause stomach pain. Eat these foods in moderation. To help prevent gas chew these foods (and others) thoroughly, and do not swallow too quickly. \n Drinking ginger ale can relieve stomach aches caused by gas. After you drink, you can try to burp or pass gas to relieve pressure. Over the counter Gas-X may also help. \n Overeating can cause discomfort and stomach pain, even if you eat too much of a healthy food. Try not to get all of your calories in one or two big meals; instead, spread out your calories in three meals and one to two healthy snacks. To ease the load on your stomach, here is a detailed breakdown of how many calories should be consumed by teenagers daily.14–16 year old male should have 3,100 when active or 2,300 when not active. Females should have 2,350 and 1,750, respectively. \n 17–18 year old male should have 3,300 when active or 2,450 when not active. Females should have 2,400 and 1,750, respectively. \n Teenagers should not be drinking alcohol, but if you are it could be a cause of stomach aches. Alcohol increases the amount of acid your stomach produces, and can lead to ulcers, acid reflux and other issues. Alcohol can also cause vomiting and diarrhea., Stomach aches can be caused by stress, anxiety, or depression. Try to reduce your stress level. Try exercising for 30 minutes each day with a long walk or jog. You can also reduce your caffeine and sugar intake, which can both lower anxiety and help your stomach feel better. \n Consider talking with a counselor if you are dealing with a lot of stress or anxiety. \n If your stomach pains are caused by menstrual cramps, you will want to have plenty of rest. In addition, you will want to avoid alcohol, caffeine and smoking., The use of medicines, herbal remedies and/or lifestyle changes are not substitutes for medical care. Given that stomach aches can point to serious problems, it is vital that you know which symptoms to take seriously and know when to see a doctor. \n If you are experiencing severe stomach pain that makes you unable to sit still, or if you need to curl into a ball to find relief, you need to visit the emergency room. This is especially true if the pain is on the right side of your abdomen.

  With the cards shuffled and placed face down, count down until you reach the 26th card.  You should memorise this card as it is your key card.  \n To make this easier you may want to replace the existing 26th card with one that you will find it easier to remember – for instance an Ace.\n  We shall name this Packet A. \n Place these cards to the left of Packet A.  We will call this pile Packet B. \n  This pile becomes Packet C. (You will note that your key card should now be sitting somewhere around the middle of Packet B.) \n Ask that they look at, and remember the top card (without showing you) and replace the card on top of the packet.  Then they should place Packet C back in its original position. \n  Once they have done this get them to place Packet A on Packet C. \n  Ask them to repeat this cut. Thank the spectator. \n Holding the cards closely to your chest you firstly need to identify your key card.  You need to find the card quickly.  It will either be in the bottom half dozen or so cards or the top half dozen or so.  \n Remember to count your key card as number one. If the key card is towards the top end of the pack you should count to the top of the pack and then continue from the bottom until you reach number 26. You have now identified your spectator’s card. \n  The cards should still be face up close to your chest.  \n Say something like: “I am having real trouble finding your card. I will need to try doing something else.” Whilst you are saying this bring the two halves of the pack together but with the cards in the right hand going on top of those in the left.  Looking at the cards face down the spectator’s card is now the top one. \n  Your right hand should be obscuring the whole of the deck from your spectators. \n  This move should not be visible to spectators as your right hand should cover this slight. \n You are now ready for the reveal.  You might like to ask the spectator to tell you the name of their card.  As they do so you toss the pack from your right hand to your left hand.  The air pressure on the overlapping card should force it to turn over. \n 
 You can find it at your local home improvement store or online. How much you buy will depend on which appliances you plan on covering. \n Stainless steel contact paper is plastic-based, so it cannot withstand heat. It is not suitable for surfaces that get hot, such as stovetops.\n Having someone help you will not only make your work go by quicker, but also make it easier. You will also get a nicer finish with fewer wrinkles and air bubbles. \n This is very important. If there is any dirt or grease on your appliance, the contact paper may not stick. Use a high-quality appliance cleaner that can cut through grease, and scrub your appliance clean. Be sure to wipe it dry with a clean cloth afterwards. \n This will ensure that your lines are straight and even. If you are covering a very wide appliance, you may need to cut two strips of contact paper. \n The grain on the finished piece will be running vertically. If you want the grain to be running horizontally, cut your contact paper accordingly. \n It will take a while, but this will lessen the chances of wrinkles or bubbles forming. \n If you are covering an appliance door, make sure that there is enough contact paper hanging over the edge to cover the side. This will typically be around 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).Have a friend or family member hold the rest of the contact paper away from the appliance's surface; this will prevent wrinkles and air bubbles. \n If you don't have a credit card, you can use any other thin, plastic tool, such as a scrapper or spatula. Avoid anything made out of metal, as this can tear the contact paper. \n For added security, consider wrapping the credit card in a thin cloth to further prevent any rips or tears., Keep doing this until you reach the bottom of your appliance. If you get any air bubbles, push them to the side of the appliance, or carefully lift the contact paper away and smooth it down again.If you need to use a second sheet of contact paper, overlap the two edges slightly., If you are covering an appliance door, you will have some excess contact paper hanging over the edges. Carefully flatten these flaps down onto the sides of your appliance's door. Run the credit card from front to back in short rows. Start from the top of the door, and work your way towards the bottom. \n Simply trim the excess away using a sharp craft blade. \n 
 Depending on how long you will be traveling or what types of items you are packing, figure out what types of luggage you need to use. \n The permitted size of carry-on bags varies from airline to airline. Check the requirements for the airline with which you will travel to learn how big your carry-on bag can be.Remember that certain items are only permissible when packed in a checked bag.\n TSA, or Transportation Security Administration and other national bodies have guidelines for a variety of items, ranging from foods and liquids to weapons. Consider what items you need to pack that might be prohibited or restricted:Food items \n Liquids, such as bath products \n Sporting goods \n Tools \n Self defense items \n Sharp objects. \n There are not many things that TSA and other relevant organizations completely prohibits, compared to the number of things that are allowed. However, many items are only permitted when they are packed in your checked bag. Research your questionable items and learn if they are only permissible when checked. \n Most liquids and some food items, like gravies and sauces or sometimes even ketchup, must be 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6 ml) or less in order to be allowed in a carry-on bag. The rules may be different for necessities such as medicine, but there still are restraints for that., While you may be inclined to pack several different outfits and pairs of shoes, consider packing only a few basic essentials and pack tighter by pairing them different ways.If you want to limit your packing to a carry-on only, then you have a limited amount of space. On the other hand, while you have more space in a checked bag, you will be charged more if it is overweight. \n Additionally, overpacking your carry-on or checked bag might result in it not fitting into the airline-approved measurements, in which case you might have to remove items from your bag to put into another bag or leave it at the airport.Checked bag fees start at $25 for one checked bag at most US airlines and go up from there, with increases for multiple checked bags and bags that are overweight., Because liquids and aerosols have the potential to explode due to the changing air pressure of air travel, TSA and other relevant organizations have special regulations about them. \n All liquid items that are 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6 ml) or smaller can go in your carry-on, and they must be packed in one 1-quart bag. Each traveler is only permitted to have one of these bags.Items that are larger that 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6 ml) can be packed in a checked bag. They do not have to be enclosed in a zip-top bag, but it is recommended in order to protect your other packed belongings. \n Medications and nourishment items for infants and children are exempt from these rules., One of the easiest ways to save space in your luggage is to change how you pack your clothing. Instead of folding your clothing and stacking it, roll it up so that it takes up less space.Rolling your clothing not only saves space but also reduces wrinkles in clothes. \n Start packing your bag by putting all of the heaviest items on the bottom, such as shoes. Then, start layering your rolled clothes on top, starting with the heaviest or largest rolled items, like sweaters or jeans, and moving to the lightest items.Packing your items in this way prevents your clothes from being further compressed and wrinkled by being buried under heavier items. \n Put toiletries and other light items on top so that they are easily accessible for removing at the security checkpoint. \n If you are packing boots or shoes, you can pack small clothing items, like undergarments, inside them. This saves packing space for other items, but only do this with items that you do not mind getting wrinkled. \n When taking both a carry-on item and a checked bag, consider putting a change of clothes in your carry-on, just in case your checked bag does not make it to your destination.This way, you have at least one additional set of clothing to wear until you receive your checked bag. \n It would also be helpful to include some key toiletry items, like a toothbrush, toothpaste, and deodorant, as long as they meet the 3.4 fluid-ounce (100.6 ml) requirement. \n If you are using a suitcase, either a small one for a carry-on or a large one for a checked bag, avoid putting bulky items in the outer zipper pockets. Doing so causes the bag to become overstuffed, causing it to no longer fit airline size requirements.Put magazines, thin books, or other slim items in these pockets. \n TSA checks all luggage, and they ask that it not be locked so that they can easily access it. If you lock it, they may damage your luggage trying to get it open. TSA is not liable when this happens.TSA does have approved locks that they can open with their own tools, including Safe Skies and Travel Sentry. \n Airlines now allow travelers to check in for their flights and secure their seats online up to 24 hours in advance. You can do this via airline apps on smartphones or on their websites. \n Checking in online ahead of time also saves you time in getting to the airport, because you can head straight to security and skip the check-in lines upon arrival. \n If you check in early, you can print or access your boarding pass through your airline's mobile app. Be sure to print it out or take a screenshot of it on your smartphone, in case you have no service in the airport to access the mobile app. \n If you check in at the airport, then airline agents will provide you with your boarding pass at that time. \n Identification is required for adult travelers who are 18 and older. Children under the age of 18 are not required to have identification when they are traveling with an adult companion. You must have a valid form of identification, including but not limited to:U.S. driver's license \n U.S. passport \n U.S. passport card \n U.S. military ID \n Permanent resident card \n Government-issued passport \n Border crossing card. \n Be aware of what time your flight is supposed to depart and what time boarding is supposed to begin. Plan to be at the airport with enough time to get through security and make it to your gate on time. \n Airlines recommend that you arrive 30-45 minutes prior to departure for domestic flights, depending on whether you have to check any baggage. For international flights, it is recommended that you arrive at least two hours prior to departure to allow time for completing international requirements.Accommodate for extra time if you have to drive yourself and park in long-term parking. You will have extra time for traveling from the parking lot to the terminal via the airport shuttle. \n If your airport is large and extremely busy, take that into consideration and arrive early, just to be sure. Also think about what day of the week you are traveling. Weekends are usually busy travel times, which means the airport and security checkpoint might be busier. \n You will need your boarding pass and a form of identification, and when you reach the screening checkpoint, you will need to have certain items easily accessible to put through screening. Keep them at the top of your carry-on so that you do not have to dig through it to find them. \n Liquids and aerosols in the quart-sized bag \n Technology devices \n Medically necessary medications and liquids \n Nourishment items for infants and children. \n When going through security, you have to remove a variety of items—or not wear them at all—in order to pass the screening.You will put these in their own containers to pass through the X-ray machine, and then you can proceed through the metal detector. \n Shoes \n Coats, jackets, and sweaters \n Belts \n Coins \n Cell phones \n Jewelry. \n If you do have liquid medications or breast milk, formula, or juice for an infant or child, you need to alert the TSA or other officers so that it can be screened properly. \n Let the TSA officer or other representative know that you have medically necessary liquids or medications when you are going through the screening. If you also need items such as ice packs, syringes, pumps, and IV bags, notify the officer about those, as well. It is helpful to have them labeled for easy screening. Keep all of these items separate from other liquids, like bath and hygiene products. Any ice packs or frozen gel packs that are necessary for your medication must be frozen solid at the security checkpoint. You do have the option to not have your medication screened by X-ray or to not have it opened, but in that case, other screening measures will have to be taken.If you have nourishment items for an infant or child, you are also allowed to bring them in excess of 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6 ml) in a carry-on item, and they can be in a zip-top bag larger than one quart. However, they must be separate from other liquids that you are checking through security. Alert the officer that you have these items so that they can be screened correctly. The officer may want to X-ray or open your breast milk, formula, or juice, but you can deny that if you would like to. In that case, other screening measures will have to be taken. Ice packs and frozen gel packs will need to be frozen solid at the time you go through security. Other items such as canned, jarred, and processed baby food are permitted, as well as liquid-filled teethers, but they will also have to be screened., Once you are through security, use the signs in the airport to help you find your gate. It is best to go straight there in order to avoid missing your flight and to make sure that you know where it is. \n After you have found your gate, you can go to the restroom, get something to eat, or shop, if you have time. \n Make the boarding process faster for yourself and everyone else by keeping any items that you anticipate you will want during the flight in the carry-on item that you will put under the seat in front of you. This will save you from digging through your carry-on item before sitting down and holding up the boarding process., After getting through security, you can go to the restaurants and shops in your terminal to buy drinks. You can also pack TSA-approved snacks in your carry-on to avoid buying them from vendors in the terminal. \n Being prepared with snacks and drinks will help tide you over until you get to your destination, because although flights still do beverage service, many short haul flights no longer offer food or snacks. When they do offer meals, you normally have to pay for them. \n An alternative is to eat at one of the airport restaurants. These are usually overpriced, but if you have a long time to wait or will have a long time before you can get your next meal, it is a good idea to eat at a restaurant. \n It can be hard to find places to charge your technology in airports. Many other people are trying to do the same thing, so finding power outlets is tricky. \n Once you are on your plane, you will be asked to power off your electronic devices or put them in Airplane Mode. Be sure to do this to avoid interference with airline signals. Remember that you cannot access any apps that require cellular data or Wi-Fi when your smartphone or other device is in Airplane Mode. \n Many airlines now offer Wi-Fi on flights, but it is almost always for a fee. Determine whether it is worth the money to access Wi-Fi on the flight. For example, if you are taking a business trip and have work to do while you travel, it will likely be worthwhile. If your trip is for pleasure, though, and you have no real need for using Wi-Fi other than entertainment, it might not be worth the price. \n To pass time on layovers and during travel, bring books, crossword puzzles, word searches, or other types of entertainment. You can read by yourself, read to one of your travel companions, or work on the puzzles with travel companions. \n Either while you are traveling or while you wait in the airport for your flight, you can take a nap. Airports and airplanes are not the most comfortable places to sleep, but if you have an extremely early flight, overnight flight, or long travel day, it is a great time to get some rest., Once your plane has reached a certain altitude, your flight attendants will announce that approved electronic devices can be used. If you would like to use your technology, you can watch a movie or a TV show to pass the time. \n Some airplanes have small TV screens in the backs of the headrests, so you can watch what is on those TVs. Keep in mind that you usually have to pay extra to access more desirable channels, instead of watching their infomercial channels or a map of your travel. \n 
 \n To create a new iMovie project, go to the "File" tab located along the top menu pane of the iMovie window. Select "New Project"; this will bring up a dialog box prompting you to name your project. Type in a name for your project in the "Project Name" field then select the "Aspect Ratio" option you want to create your iMovie project in. Click "Create." \n This will bring up a window displaying all of your still images in the bottom right hand corner of the iMovie window.

 This is a crucial part of the class; presentation is everything.\n \n A Western shirt (boys wear a plaid western shirt or a jacket and shirt, girls wear a slinky and vest, or a jacket, or a show suit.) \n A Western belt and buckle (can be plain or "blinged up" with crystals or diamante.) The buckle may be plain or jeweled. \n Show pants \n Western boots (youth are permitted to wear jodhpurs in Australia). Spurs must not be worn, and incur elimination. \n Training tips and steps can be found in How to train for a Western Showmanship Class if your horse is already trained in Halter, than you can progress to the next step. \n This is a critical part of the competition, the judge will not only be watching you complete the pattern and handle the horse, but will be inspecting your presentation of the gear. Cleaning also means washing your shirts and pants, polishing your boots and cleaning your hat. \n This is also the time to fix your hair and for the girls, your make-up. This is a competition of presentation, looks and performance; make sure you look like you know what you're doing. That's half the battle. \n If they mess up a step, then you will do the same and therefore will be placed lower than if you did the pattern properly. \n About 15 minutes before your event, practice the pattern and pin-point where you may need to put a little more 'oomph' into your cues. Then rest your horse until about 5 minutes before you enter the ring. This allows your horse to warm up but not become stale. \n The idea is to be confident and move with purpose. If you move sluggish and lazily, then you will not place as high. The steward will direct you to where you are meant to stand, the pattern should state this. \n It is your responsibility to learn the pattern before you enter the ring. \n After the placings are announced and awards given, congratulate the other competitors and exit with a smile rather than a grin. \n 
 This is so you can tell apart the white from the blue thread which makes up denim. If you skip this step then your whole shorts could get ruined because all the threads will be white and impossible to tell apart.\n If you look closely at the denim you can see white and blue threads running horizontal against each other. Cut two horizontal lines across the shorts using scissors, leaving a strip of fabric in between the slits. Cut them the length you want your distressed/worn patch to be. Using a tool you want to remove the blue threads from the fabric you just cut. You could use a needle, safety pin, or food/salad clamps to remove the blue threads, you need to do this constantly until all the blue thread has gone and you only have white strings showing, it takes quite a while so do this when you have a bit of time, don't rush otherwise you could be left with just a frayed hole. \n You may want to leave some white and just cut it short to leave threads hanging to give an even better look! \n All you need to do is put the shorts in the wash and that will separate the threads even more to have more exaggerated holes and to remove all the excess thread that's not needed. \n Don't use a tumble dryer as the threads can get caught and break from the shorts, once they're done you're ready to start bleaching! Always wear protective gloves as bleach does burn straight through skin! Now, I wouldn't personally recommend any brand of bleach because you're not looking for the hygiene job, just how thick the bleach is. Of course you can't test the bleach in-store so you're going to have to find the best brand for you out of trial and error. Buy the thickest bleach you can afford and water it down when its in the bowl/container. \n If you only want a half an half effect there's no need for bands. Don't use red rubber bands otherwise the red dye used in the bands will leak onto the shorts leaving red stains and patches. Here are the methods to get the look you want- \n All of the shorts in- All shorts will turn a whitey-blue colour. \n Half of the shorts in- A two tone white and blue effect. \n Tie rubber bands around shorts in a ball- Random spotty tie dye effect. \n Tie rubber band knots randomly- Small clouds of white. \n Don't use any other methods to dry the shorts otherwise the effect and colour could change. Leave the shorts for 3 days to make sure they are definitely dry otherwise you could burn yourself testing if the shorts are still wet. \n But you can add more items to your shorts! Lots of DIY and accessory stores sell chains, studs and gems which you can sew or glue onto your shorts. Even though studding may take a lot of time it make shorts look even better and shop bought. You can write or design anything using the gems/studs! For example your initial, just covering a pocket or making designs like a cross or a skull. Id recommend HobbyCraft for their choice in clothes decorations. \n Blue isn't enough this summer and colour range all over the rainbow! Fabric dye can be very easy to get hold of and its not expensive either, you can buy fabric dye at all hobby stores or general DIY stores. Fabric dye doesn't contain anymore bleach so your shorts won't get ruined. \n Lay shorts in liquid for 30 minutes then take out and lye on newspaper to prevent staining. Leave shorts to dry naturally without any heat and there you have it! Your own pair of bleached, distressed jeans! Enjoy! \n
\n it is accumulating in your bladder and you cannot urinate), go to the Emergency Room. If you cannot control your urine (i.e. are leaking urine involuntarily), this is another potential sign of CES. Similarly, a sudden inability to control your bowels (such as inadvertently passing stool or leaking stool from your rectum) is a possible sign of CES. All of these warrant prompt medical attention and evaluation. \n Seek medical help immediately. \n"If you notice numbness in the "saddle area" (picture the area of your pelvis that would be in contact with a saddle if you were to sit on one), this area it is a "red flag" (worrisome) symptom and you need to see a doctor immediately. Numbness in the genital ("saddle") area is not normal, and may be a sign of impending (or already present) CES. \n You may feel an aching and severe pain in your lower back, which can be debilitating. This is another red flag symptom and it may vary in intensity or grow slowly over time., You may find that your ankle and knee reflexes are diminished. You may also experience deteriorating reflexes in the anus and bulbospongiosus muscle, located between the anus and the genitals.,"Oftentimes, CES follows an incident that causes trauma or another problem in the spinal cord. Things to be aware of that greatly increase your risk of CES include: \n A recent infection (it is possible that this may have spread to the spinal cord) \n Recent back surgery \n Recent back trauma, such as an accident or other injury \n A history of cancer (sometimes cancer metastases can spread to the spine leading to compression of the nerve roots) \n Time spent waiting or hesitating is precious time lost that could cost you your long-term function and health. \n If any of these are abnormal, it may be an indication of potential Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES). \n Your doctor may test your mobility and coordination by asking you to walk on your heels and toes. \n He or she will examine for pain when you bend forward, backward, and to each side. \n Your doctor will check your anal sensation and reflexes, as abnormalities here are key aspects of the diagnosis of CES. \n The imaging test will allow the doctor to see your spinal cord, including the nerve roots, and to evaluate what, if anything, may be causing them to be compressed. Possible sources of spinal cord compression that may be detected on CT or MRI include:A primary spine tumor or cancer metastases \n A herniated disc in your spine \n Bone spurs \n An infection that has gotten into your spinal cord \n A fracture of the spinal cord \n Narrowing of the spinal canal for any reason \n Inflammatory spinal disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis (inflammatory arthritis) \n Spinal hemorrhages \n This is when contrast material is inserted into the cerebrospinal fluid in your spinal cord, and then an x-ray type image is taken. \n The contrast allows clear visualization as to whether there are any abnormalities or displacements in your spinal column. \n The myelogram may show herniated discs, bone spurs, or tumors, all of which may be responsible for causing CES. \n Your doctor may perform the following tests: \n Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) — This test will measure the speed of electrical impulse as it moves through the nerve. This test can determine if there is nerve damage and can how much.The nerve will be stimulated by an electrode patch attached at one end and the electric impulse is recorded by another patch.Electromyography (EMG) — This test is often done at the same time as an NCV and it measures the electrical activity in your muscles., The surgery needs to be performed within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, if possible, and the sooner it is done the better. \n The surgery will consist of removing whatever material (such as a tumor, or an infection) that is compressing your spinal cord. \n The goal is that, by treating the underlying cause (the cause of the spinal cord compression), the tension will be removed from your nerve roots, and you should hopefully be able to regain function. \n These may include: \n Chronic pain — some people require long-term pain medications to ease ongoing nerve-related pain following CES. \n Bladder or bowel dysfunction — some people continue to struggle with bladder and/or bowel control, even after surgical resolution of their CES. (However, the good news here is that bladder and bowel function often improve in the years following surgery; it just may take longer to regain function than other affected areas.) \n Sexual problems — patients are often advised to see a sex therapist for help if they are struggling to regain sexual function. \n Motor problems — problems walking or performing other movement tasks, particularly with your lower limbs. \n Needless to say, these are things you want to avoid! Therefore, if in doubt, go to your local Emergency Room for evaluation of your signs and symptoms to ensure that, if you are developing CES, it is treated and resolved as quickly as possible. \n 
 The IV stand is the tall coat hanger-like device that you will hang the IV bag on when you are preparing and administering it. In case you can’t find an IV stand and it is an emergency, your will have to hook the bag up to a place that is above the patient’s head, so that the force of gravity helps the liquid to flow downward into the person's vein.\n Turn the faucet on and lather your hands with soap and water. Start with your palms and work to the back of your hands. Make sure that you also clean the areas between your fingers. The next step is to focus on washing from your fingers to your wrists. Finally, rinse thoroughly and pat your hands dry. \n If there is no water source, rub your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer., It is always important to check the doctor’s orders again before you begin. Giving a patient the wrong IV bag could lead to a life-threatening situation, such as an allergic reaction. \n You should double check that you are giving the medication to the right patient, that you are doing it at the right date and time, that you are giving the correct medication in the correct order, and that the bag is the right volume. \n If you have any questions at all, it is important that you ask the doctor before continuing so that you are 100% sure you understand what you are supposed to do. \n A set is the tube and connector that regulate how much fluid the patient will get. A macroset is used when you are supposed to give the patient 20 drops per minute, or about 100 mL per hour. Adults generally receive a macroset.A microset is used when you want to give the patient 60 drops of IV fluid per minute. Infants, toddlers, and younger children generally need a microset. \n The size of the tubing (and the size of needle) that you use will also depend on the purpose for the IV. If it is an emergency situation where the patient needs fluids as quickly as possible, you will more likely choose a larger needle and tube in order to deliver the fluids and/or blood products or other medications as quickly as possible. \n In less urgent situations, you may choose a smaller needle and tubing. \n The trick here is that the higher the needle gauge, the smaller the size of the needle. 14 is the largest and it is usually used to correct symptoms of shock and trauma. 18-20 is the usual kind of needle used by adult patients. 22 is usually used on pediatric patients (such as infants, toddlers, and young children) or geriatric patients with ., Always wear gloves for standard protection against blood and body fluid exposure. \n When the time comes to give the patient the IV, you will want to have all of your supplies right there. This will ensure that the procedure as quick and easy as possible. \n Look at the bag and locate the port of entry (this is located at the top of the IV bottle and is similar to a bottle cap). The port of entry is also where the macroset or microset line will be inserted. Unwrap an alcohol swab to sanitize the port of entry and the surrounding area of the bag.If you ever get confused while assembling the IV bag, there should be instructions written on the bag that you can follow. However, if you have any questions, stop what you're doing and find someone who knows what to do. \n Ensure that the drip chamber is in place (this is the part of the IV line that collects the fluid going through the patient’s vein). This is also the part where medical personnel are able to regulate the IV to make sure the patient gets the right medication. \n IV pumps, or infusion pumps, are often used to help deliver a precise dose for the proper amount of time. \n Make sure that the drip chamber is half filled. Once it is half filled, let the fluid in the IV flow until it reaches the end of the line (this is to remove any air bubbles are are trapped in the line). Close it when it reaches the end by clamping the tube. \n This is also termed as priming the tubing. This is an essential step, as inserting an air bubble into the patient could be fatal. \n The IV is sterile (as in it does not have any bad microorganisms on it). If the line touches the floor, the fluid in the IV could be compromised (meaning bad microorganisms could get into it and infect the patient).If the IV line does touch the floor, you will have to prepare a new IV, as the contaminated IV could potentially harm your patient. Keep the IV line close so that it does not touch the floor again. \n Be courteous, introduce yourself and tell him that you will be the one administering his IV fluids. It's best to lay all of the facts out for your patient — the needle puncturing his skin will hurt. Try to describe it so that he knows what he is getting into., Wash your hands again to ensure extra cleanliness before putting on your gloves — this can also help reassure the patient that you care about her health and protecting her against unnecessary exposure to bacteria. \n Lying or sitting calms the patient down and actually reduces the amount of pain she will feel. It also ensures that she is in a stable position where she won't pass out if she has a psychological fear of needles. \n The cannula is the tube-like structure that you will insert at the same time as the needle, but it will stay in place after you take the needle out. You should look for a vein on the non-dominant arm (the one the person doesn't write with). You should look for a long, dark vein that you will easily be able to see when you are inserting the needle.Start by looking for veins lower down on the arm, or even on the back of the hand. Starting lower down will give you more "chances" if you are not successful at inserting the IV on your first try. If you need to try a second time, you will need to move higher up the arm, so there are benefits to trying lower down first if you can find a reasonably visible vein. \n You can also look for veins that are located in the crease where the forearm meets the upper arm. These are often the easiest to insert an IV into; however, if the patient bends his arm, this can block the IV. \n When you tie the tourniquet, it will cause the vein to bulge, which will make it easier to see, and easier to insert the needle into. \n Use an alcohol swab to clean the insertion site (the spot that you will be putting the needle into). Use a circular motion when you clean the spot so that you get rid of as many microorganisms as possible. Let the area dry.Do not wave your hand over the area as if to dry it, as this can causes bacteria to be waved over the "cleaned area". Instead, allow the alcohol to air dry. \n Position the cannula so that you are holding it at a 30–45 degree angle to the patient’s arm and vein. Hold the cannula like you would hold a syringe so that you do not accidentally pass it through the vein. When you feel a “pop” and dark blood appears inside the cannula, decrease the angle of insertion so it is parallel to the patient’s skin.If this is your first time you are attempting this procedure, make sure you are doing so under supervision. \n Push the cannula forward another 2mm. Then fix the needle and push the rest of the cannula in a little bit further.Remove the needle fully. Apply pressure above insertion site while maintaining site and connect tubing, otherwise the patient may bleed. \n Dispose of the needle in a designated sharps container. \n Finally, untie the tourniquet and clean the insertion site where the cannula is sticking out of the skin with a hypoallergenic dressing or alcohol swab. \n You should do this by slowly feeding the tubing into the cannula until you can connect it. Make sure that it is secure once it is connected. Slowly open the line so that the IV fluid goes into the tube and into the patient. You should also put tape on the tubing so that it stays in place on the patient’s arm. \n Start by administering normal saline in order to ensure the IV is open and unobstructed.If you notice swelling in the surrounding tissue, or other problems with fluid administration, stop the saline flush and immediately remove the cannula. You will need to start the process over again. \n Assuming that the saline flows normally through the IV access you have set up, you can proceed to administering what the doctor has specifically ordered through the IV. \n Regulate the IV drip rate according to the physician’s order. Usually in a clinic or hospital, the physician will order a specific rate, like milliliters per hour. \n In a field setting, you will need to do this manually. The IV may have roller clamps and you need to count the drops per minute. Other IV sets already have a roller knob that you can turn and set the drops per minute so that you don’t have to count. \n Check your patient’s heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature. Report any untoward signs and symptoms. These symptoms could include an elevated heart rate, respiratory rate, difficulty breathing, hives, anaphylactic shock, or an increase in temperature and high blood pressure. \n 
 Common majors for successful strength and conditioning coaches include Strength and Conditioning, obviously, but also Kinesiology and Exercise Science, among others. By taking classes in these subjects, you will gain the knowledge you'll need to help your athletes improve. \n Your chances of being hired and paid well in this position will be higher if you hold an associate's or bachelor's degree in one of these or in a related field. \n Research your local colleges and universities to determine which program is the best fit for you. \n If attending college full-time is not an option for you, take continuing education classes in those fields. Even if you don't earn a degree, you will still learn the type of information you will need to perform the job.\n If you want to work at a high level and make a larger salary, your employer might require certification as a strength and conditioning coach. However, if the position you are trying to attain does not specifically request certification, you may be able to skip it. \n Although there are many agencies for certifying strength and conditioning coaches, the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) is the most widely respected of these., The National Strength and Conditioning Association's exam costs $260 for NSCA members, and $445 for non-members. Make room for the exam in your budget. \n Look up what information will be cover in your agency of choice's test. Study the format of the exam as well — will it be entirely multiple choice, or do you need to brush up your essay-writing skills? \n If you took classes in college relevant to the exam, look at your old class notes to refresh the information in your mind. \n Most reputable certification agencies will provide study materials for people studying to take the exam. Avail yourself of those resources. \n An elementary-aged athlete’s body is very different from a high school-aged athlete’s body, and you cannot treat every age group with the same blanket approach to exercise.With young children (6-11 years old), be aware that girls will develop motor skills at an earlier age than boys. \n With children, plan activities that will help young athletes develop basic motor skills like jumping, throwing, catching, skipping, climbing, etc., rather than focusing on the specialized motions of the specific sport you’re preparing them for. Older athletes should be encouraged to develop more complex skills like speed, agility, and flexibility. \n Remember to address all the major muscle groups, including calf muscles, hamstrings, quadriceps, shoulders, etc., You cannot use a generic, blanket approach to all athletes. Each sport — and sometimes, each position within a sport — will require athletes to develop specialized skill sets. Make sure you understand the needs of your particular athletes before beginning a training program with them. For example, goalies in ice hockey and catchers in baseball spend much of their time squatting. Their strength and conditioning needs will be very different from a marathon runner, whose needs will be very different from a football running back whose position calls for quick bursts of speed and the agility to make sharp cuts. \n Yoga is a terrific way to strengthen core muscles, as are sit-ups and crunches, low back extensions, Supermans, and exercises with kettle bells. You should also consider activities that will benefit players of specific sports; for example, basketball players will benefit from passing a medicine ball back and forth, while taking golf swings while balanced on one leg will help golfers., Though athletes in all sports should work on their upper bodies, some sports — gymnastics, for example — specifically require a great deal of upper body strength. Bicep curls, push-ups, tricep push-ups, pull-ups, and rope climbing are all good exercises for arm strength. \n If their legs can't support them, athletes will be hard-pressed to win in a competitive setting. Running, either on a track or on a treadmill, not only develops long muscle in athletes' legs, but it also improves their cardiovascular health and endurance, allowing them to perform at a high level without tiring for longer amounts of time. To add power for athletes whose sports require it specifically, leg exercise routines should include squats, leg presses, lunges, and vertical jumps. \n These exercises are meant to maintain, rather than increase, muscle mass. \n Have your athletes hold each position for a set amount of time; consider their injury and physical ability, and use your discretion in determining the duration of the hold. Add at least 10 seconds onto their best time every two weeks to improve form. \n As a strength and conditioning coach, you will serve in many capacities: teacher, leader, motivator, and support system for the athletes under your guidance. Because you will see your athletes through a wide variety of experiences, you need to be able to adjust your approach from context to context, from day to day. \n Although your athletes will likely be socialized to accept orders from coaches unquestioningly, there may be situations in which you have to alter the manner in which you deliver your message, depending on the emotional state of your audience in that context. Your goal as a coach is not to domineer, but to get the best possible results out of your athletes. This may mean that you have to change the delivery of your message from “an order” to “advice.” \n Ethos is credibility: speak from a place of authority. Most of your communication will be ethically charged orders and commands. Logos is a logical approach: perhaps an athlete feels like giving up because he or she is having a bad day. Reason with them. Instead of speaking from authority, help them understand how logical it is to work through their bad days to reach their goals. Pathos is an emotional approach: on your athletes' worst days, you’ll have to work hard to understand how they’re feeling and help them change negative emotions into positive mindsets. \n 
 Medieval can be anything from 900 (kilts and loose gowns) to 1600 (neck high corsets and hoop skirts). If you show up in an Elizabethan gown and everyone else is sporting basic tunics and pants, it will look silly.\n Find out if it will be cheaper to make it (if you have the skills for that) or cheaper to buy it online. \n Then you can buy in bulk, cheaper. Also, you'll be able to spot your family easily in the crowd despite strange clothing you're not used to. \n A man who hates the notion of wearing tights will be embarrassed and uncomfortable for the whole wedding. A woman who would never display her cleavage shouldn't wear a corset. \n Offer to put them in touch with anyone else going to the wedding - often for a large order, they'll let you get things at a lower rate. \n If you mention to a vendor that another place is willing to make a bulk deal, you could get better rates - but do *not* lie to them. A lot of those people work together at the same fairs, and have good friendly relationships. \n The more people dressed by the same company, the more classy the wedding will look - and the less you'll stick out. \n Men: Don't tuck in your shirt, strap a belt across it. And wear the belt under your belly, if you have a belly. It just looks silly when someone tries to girdle in their gut with a leather strap. It should go where your pants belt goes. Ask someone who does medieval re-enactment or a friend who is a history buff to help you try on the clothing. Some things that look like they go on easily don't. Corsets lace in the back, belts wrap around you twice, and men look very silly if they tuck in their shirt, since the shirt has a billowy loose bottom. \n Find out if the venue has somewhere you can change, or at worst, wear some of the costume and put on the parts you can't wear in the car (corset, belt, etc) once you get there. \n One of the best parts of medieval clothing is that you can wear loose pants or skirts that hide your shoes entirely, and medieval clothing never, ever had high heels until well after the Victorian era. Do not, under any circumstances, wear a traditional gown with heels. You'll be very off balance, more likely to fall, and look ridiculous. \n By the end of the day you might be relieved to put on a pair of jeans and a sweater. Being stuck in something you're not used to wearing might be frustrating or even embarrassing if you're pulled over or have to stop for food. People who wear that kind of clothing all the time for fairs or re-enactments are used to being looked at funny in the 7-Eleven, but it might be pretty humiliating if you aren't. \n Otherwise, sell it on Etsy or eBay. You can make a decent penny back on your investment that way, and if you have a set of family costumes, you might even help another family going to a wedding! \n 
 Since this is infield a 12 inch (30.5 cm) should be just fine. A broken in glove is best.\n This is your starting position. From here, you can move to cover first or second base, and you're filling the space in between so that you can get any balls hit there. \n If you have a left handed batter, take a small step closer to 1st, not more than a few steps though. \n If there is a runner on first, step a little to second base. More than likely you will get a throw, and it's faster to run to second when you're closer to the base. \n Prepare for every possible situation. Know where to throw the ball if it comes to you, and what base to cover if it doesn't. Talk to your teammates so that you all know where to play the ball. \n Always know where the runners are. Try to get the lead runner. They have a better chance of scoring, and getting them out first will make it easier to get future runners. If you are not sure where to play, throw to first. That is your best bet. \n This gives you a chance to warn the catcher or the player if the runner tries to steal. This can help them respond faster when the runner starts running. \n Stay on your toes, ready to move any direction at any moment. Always keep an eye on the batter and the ball. Be ready for anything that comes your way. \n Playing is all about having fun. Don't give off negative attitude. It boosts your spirit and friendship with the other team and also makes the rest of the players on yours and the others team happier and spirit lifted. Encourage your teammates and always thank the other team for a good game. \n More than likely you will receive a throw. Don't worry, shortstop will cover your position! \n Shortstop can't cover, so you have to run! \n If you cover first, the catcher,first baseman, or third baseman can throw the ball to you to get the batter out. \n Shortstop can't cover second because the have to back up third base. \n Most of the time shortstop covers second base. If there's nowhere else you're supposed to be, back her up. \n If it is hit far out in left field you cover second base. If it is far out in right field, then you are to run and be the cut off. Short stop will cover second base. \n If there is a runner, they will go on a bad throw from the catcher. If you back up the throw you could possibly throw the runner out. \n You have to remember to watch the runner and back up the throw in case the runner does run to second. Alert the pitcher when they have the ball if the runner on first is attempting to go to second because they may not be paying attention and they could throw it to second or first and possibly get the runner out. \n Just start backing up the pitcher once there is a runner on second. \n In this scenario, you don't have to tag the runner. There will be other events where you have to tag the runner. \n Think of an imaginary line from the pitcher to the actual second base. Don't intrude when a grounder or pop fly is hit to them and they won't intrude when a grounder or pop fly is hit to you. \n 
 Aim for eight hours of sleep the first night after the cold starts coming on. A full night's rest improves immune function, making it easier for your body to fight off the invading virus.If you cannot get a full night's sleep, take a 20 to 30 minute nap in the middle of the day to force your body into rest-mode. \n If possible, skip work or school at the onset of your cold in order to get more rest.Staying home can also prevent the virus from spreading to other people.\n Fluids can also break up congestion and ease symptoms. \n You should drink at least eight to ten 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water each day, especially when you notice a cold coming on. \n Water, caffeine-free teas, sports drinks, pure fruit juices, clear broth, and ginger ale are all acceptable and beneficial for colds. \n Limit drinks with caffeine or alcohol in them, as these are diuretics that can cause dehydration. \n Green tea and peppermint tea are both thought to contain properties that can help boost your body's defenses while expelling germs from the body., Dryness can help cold viruses linger and thrive, so filling the air with moisture can cut down on the length of your cold.Adding moisture can also ease your symptoms by preventing your nasal passages from feeling dry and sore. \n Run a humidifier in the room you spend most of your time in or take a hot shower to create plenty of steam. \n Warm moisture can be especially helpful. \n Consuming healthy calories is also essential early on so that your body has enough energy to fight the virus. \n Make sure to drink the broth as well. The hot liquid contains a vast amount of the soup's nutrition and will also help keep you hydrated. \n \n Possible negative side effects include upset stomach, nausea, abdominal pain, and mouth irritation. People who take intranasal zinc have also been known to permanently lose their sense of smell.At most, zinc may only trim a day off the duration of your cold. \n Zinc supplements are available in liquid drop form, tablet form, lozenge form, and as intranasal spray. \n Lemon juice contains high levels of vitamin C, and the acidic nature of the juice can also help soothe your early symptoms and reduce the amount of phlegm.By reducing the amount of phlegm, you may be able to prevent the virus from settling in and causing a long-lasting infection. \n Squeeze a lemon wedge into your tea or sip on lemonade. \n You can also enjoy tea that combines lemon and honey for an even stronger benefit. \n Some researchers believe that ginger promotes healthy sweating, which can help boost your immune system at the start of a cold. By stimulating perspiration, ginger can cleanse your system and help lower your body temperature.Sweat contains dermcidin, a germ-fighting agent that may provide protection against invading microorganisms. The ability to protect your body from these invaders is strongest when you sweat a little, which ginger can help promote. \n Steep a few slices of fresh ginger in hot water for several minutes to create an herbal tea. You could also consume foods containing ginger. \n Garlic contains allicin, a compound thought to boost the immune system and relieve cold symptoms. Some studies indicate that garlic may even help fight viruses and prevent future colds from happening to you.You can prepare a garlic "tea" by crushing one or two cloves of garlic and letting the garlic steep in hot water for several minutes. \n You can also increase your garlic intake by consuming foods prepared with garlic. Add a little garlic to your chicken soup or help yourself to a slice of garlic toast. \n But studies seem to indicate that Echinacea and goldenseal are most effective when used as soon as you feel a cold coming on. \n Take a liquid tincture of Echinacea or goldenseal since it seems to be more effective than the capsule form of these herbs. \n If you are taking any medications, check with your doctor to verify that it is safe to take these herbal supplements. Herbs can negatively interfere with some medications. \n Have a bowl of chili or add a dash of hot sauce to your next meal. Spicy foods temporarily open the sinus passages, which can relieve congestion and keep the mucus flowing.Note that this is most effective when your early symptoms start in your nose rather than your throat. By keeping your sinus passages as clear as possible, you can help prevent infection from setting in and encourage the expulsion of the cold virus. \n Manually flushing out germs can promote a speedy recovery. \n Squeeze the bulb syringe to fill it with saline fluid and place the tip in your nostril about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6 to 12 mm) deep. Slowly release the bulb to empty the saline into your nose. \n If you cannot get to the store to buy saline nasal solution, make your own by combining 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt with 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) baking soda and 8 oz (250 ml) warm water. Use it in conjunction with a Neti pot for best results and make sure you always use water that has been filtered, distilled, or boiled for at least a minute. \n Make sure to rinse the syringe after each application and let it air dry. Doing so can prevent re-exposure to the same germs. \n \n While decongestants often help soothe your symptoms, they may or may not help shorten the length of your cold. By easing your symptoms, however, you improve your odds of staying well-rested, which can increase your body's overall ability to fight off the virus faster. \n Note that decongestants can increase heart rate. They may also cause anxiety and insomnia in some individuals. If you are taking prescription medication for any condition, consult a pharmacist prior to purchasing medication to ensure no interactions will affect you negatively. \n \n Antihistamines are generally considered allergy medicines but they stop sneezing and reduce drainage more effectively than a decongestant does. By drying up the mucus, an antihistamine limits the amount of time the virus comes into contact with the lining of your nose. This may cut down on the length of your cold as a result. \n As with other treatments, the sooner you start taking the medication, the stronger the effect will be. \n Note that antihistamines tend to make people drowsy. Those that also contain a decongestant tend to minimize this drowsiness, however. You can look for non-drowsy antihistamines. Avoid using antihistamines if you are driving or work with heavy machinery. \n Since your symptoms are mildest at the onset of your cold, take the time to squeeze in some light exercise — like brisk walking, in two to three 10-minute stretches. \n Yoga and other gentle exercises can be performed instead of walking. These options may even be better if the weather outside is too nasty for a walk. \n Take precautions if the weather is chilly or rainy. Bundle up in order to keep yourself dry and warm. \n Taking a walk outside on a sunny day can also grant you the opportunity to absorb some vitamin D from the sun, thereby giving your immune system another added boost. \n Vitamin C does boost the immune system, however, and some research suggests that it may shorten the duration of symptoms if taken at the beginning of a cold. \n Vitamin C can be taken in supplement form or it can be consumed naturally through food and drink. Most fruits contain high doses of vitamin C. This is especially true of citrus fruits. \n It also has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties, which can offer further help in speeding up your body's healing response. \n Take a spoonful of honey when you notice your first symptoms in order to give your immune system a quick jolt. \n Honey is especially soothing if your first symptoms begin in your throat. \n You can mix honey into your tea, coffee, or water as well. \n Acidophilus and other active cultures in yogurt can put healthy bacteria back into your body, thereby strengthening your immune system. These beneficial bacteria can help stimulate the production of various immune system substances that help your body fight diseases.Yogurt is especially effective at returning healthy bacteria to your gastrointestinal tract, where much of your immune function actually occurs. \n 
 It can be any kind of paper, though origami paper is best.\n Crease the fold, then unfold the paper. \n Crease the fold, then unfold the paper. The paper should be split into fourths. \n Then make a diagonal fold, bringing the bottom right corner of the paper to the top left corner of the paper. Crease the fold, then unfold the paper. \n Crease the fold, then unfold the paper. \n There should be eight total triangles, and 2 triangles in each fourth of the paper. Anyway, there should be a fold starting from the left side of the paper all the way to the right side of the paper. Not a vertical line, not a diagonal line, but a horizontal line. It doesn't matter which way you place the paper. There should be a line from exactly left to right on the paper. If you didn't crease hard enough, you may have trouble identifying this line. But if you creased correctly, this line should be easy to spot. \n Next, bring both parts of the horizontal line together, forming a 3D figure. \n Push one of the triangles down on a flat surface, then bring the top triangle down on the bottom triangle. Keep on pushing until both triangles come together into one triangle. You should not be able to push the top triangle further down into the bottom triangle. \n Well, you are going to make more flaps! Before you make more flaps, you should see a crease in the center of the triangle, giving a right part and a left part to the triangle. Get hold of the right part of the flap, then fold up that flap to meet the crease in the center. After that, get hold of the left part of the flap, then fold that flap to meet the crease in the center. \n \n You should have a basic diamond shape right now, but there are still more steps. \n Fold the right part of the first part of this diamond to meet the center of the diamond. \n This time, use the second part of the diamond instead of the first part of the diamond. \n Extend the pockets with your fingertips, then notice the two flaps on each side of the diamond at the very top of the diamond. Slide each of the flaps at the very top of the diamond into each of the pockets. \n Make sure you keep the flaps down with your fingers because sometimes if you don't tuck the flaps in very well, the flaps might come out and you may have to start over. \n
, Measure your paper according to the following formulas: \n Height = Height of gift bag + 2” + 1.25” \n Width = Width of bag + depth of bag + width+ depth + 0.5” \n If you see a fold in the paper, try to align the fold with one of the natural creases of the paper. If you don’t mind a fold in your bag, then you don’t have to worry about placement. \n The wrong side should be facing you. \n \n Measure the depth from the fold that you just made and fold. \n Measure the width again and fold. \n Measure the depth again and fold. You are creating the 4 sides of the bag. If you’ve done this correctly, you will have 0.5” left over for the seam of the bag. \n Make the piece 1” tall. You will place this under the rim of the bag to reinforce the paper. \n The top of the chipboard or cardstock should meet the top crease in the paper where you folded the top down. \n Since the bag is 2-ply, you will have to glue each layer of paper separately. \n Make sure that the cut edge of the panel aligns with the folded edge of the flap. \n \n Fold the short sides inward and crease them. \n Bring the top and bottom triangles together. This is exactly the way that you fold the sides when you are wrapping a gift. \n Place glue around the diagonal sides of the triangles and glue the pieces together. \n The height should match the depth of the gift bag, and its width should match the width of the gift bag. Then, trim 0.25” from each side of the cardboard. \n This will hide the bottom seams and reinforce the bag. \n These holes will house the handles of the bag. \n You want the cord to be the appropriate length for grabbing the bag plus 2” on each end for the knots. \n
 It is not transmitted from person to person or from animal to person. A person with cryptococcosis is not contagious., This tiny (microscopic) fungus similar to yeast (previously known to grow in the environment of certain warm, tropical countries) is parasitic and causes serious diseases in humans and animals. Why the fungus appeared on the east coast of Vancouver Island, B.C. in 1999 is not clear. It may have been imported or it may have always existed on Vancouver Island and increased in prevalence due to some climate or environmental changes. \n Various Cryptococcus fungus are found growing and spreading in the environment in B.C. and in other places including tropical and subtropical climates in countries such as Brazil and Australia. The C. gattii variety of the cryptococcal fungus lives "on trees and in the soil". It was discovered due to finding recent human and animal cases of cryptococcusis, fungal illness, in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health Department Regions, and it is now being found in other areas as well.In Washington State, U.S.A., C. gattii was first identified in cats in 2005; since that time dogs, cats and pet birds have been found to be infected. A small number of human cases have been reported from western Washington.It is not certain how Cryptococcus gattii spread from Vancouver Island to the North American mainland. It may have been transported through the air or on people, vehicles and products traveling from the Island to the mainland. More recently it has been found in the states of Washington and Oregon, as well as in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Regions. \n The C. neoformans and C. grubii cause illness mainly in people with "impaired immune systems". On the other hand, C. gattii can cause illness in otherwise healthy people as well as those with impaired immunity. Although C. gattii infection is rare, several Washington residents were recently discovered to be infected by C. gattii., About 25 people become sick from cryptococcosis every year in B.C., Canada. About one of 20 persons dies from the disease (5% mortality in those infected)., The fungus is tiny and cannot be seen with the naked eye. The fungus on trees can only be identified by testing tree samples in a laboratory. \n In soil (which appears as normal soil). \n
 Be careful not to disturb or damage them while working around them. \n Barely loosen (break loose) each of the 11 bolts (10mm) connecting the OHC (overhead cam) valve cover to the engine. Loosen the 9 bolts around the edge of the cover that connect it to the block (one in on the very end). Two of those 10mm bolts are upon the cover with one about 3 times longer and (it was covered up by that power steering hose) and the one in the center is about 4 times longer than the ones around the edges. Once all are just loosened then finish removing them., The engine should be easy to turn with a socket wrench on the crankshaft bolt since the spark plugs are out and all pressure is released.\n Caution: with the negative terminal of the battery disconnected. aligned with the top of the engine head while at the same time you line up the timing mark on the crankshaft harmonic pulley pointing straight up at the same time as the cams are aligned (or use the crankshaft key and slot later in the process when the harmonic pulley is off). \n Caution: the TDC could be 180 degrees off of the correct TDC even when the crankshaft mark or crankshaft key is correctly pointing straight up ("It would then be at the top of the exhaust stroke."); so then align it as explained next. \n Caution: check timing is at the correct TDC (top dead center of the compression stroke) and find the marks are on the back of the sprockets and align them with the edge of the engine head. The older models have a distributor and you can remove the distributor cap to see if it is pointing at spark plug cable terminal number one (for cylinder number 1) when the mark on crankshaft pulley shows it is at TDC. If it points to the opposite side of the distributor then turn the engine slowly 360 degrees on the crankshaft to be back around to TDC ("top of the compression stroke"). \n Newer engines do not have a distributor and so the correct TDC can be found while the harmonic pulley timing mark is approaching TDC. This is done using the compression stroke air pressure measured in the "number one spark plug hole" by a "compression gauge" to know when the piston is on the compression stroke and then turning slowly and carefully to exactly the TDC as shown by the crankshaft and the cam sprockets timing marks. Compression pressure means that the piston in cylinder one was on the compression stroke not the exhaust stroke which also comes to TDC. \n Required: securely place a "plastic/rubber" stop-block (you may use a bottle stopper from a wine bottle preferably "not real cork" which might crumble) to put it in place to jam the cam sprockets with the "rubber stop-block." Use the stop-block before releasing the tensioner pulley to remove the timing belt, or else when the timing belt is removed the cams will "turn" (in opposite directions) about two notches--pushed by the valve springs pressure off TDC of the cam lobes. Later before the timing belt is re-installed use two "open-end" wrenches or adjustable spanners for 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) on the hex part of the camshaft (not on the sprocket bolt) to slightly nudge the sprockets back and forth (small wiggling) to get the stop block to hold both cam marks correctly aligned while the stop-block is between the two cam sprockets. So it holds both cams at the same time in TDC position (You may purchase a special stop-block made for this purpose if you prefer.). \n Put on the parking brake., Then use a jack-stand to support the car. Do not depend on the jack to support it. You will be removing the wheel adjacent to (next to) the pulleys only., Watch your head., It should work under the air conditioner bracket which is massive on the older models. The engine being supported is because you will remove (not yet) the motor mount in steps when you get to it in a later step; that mount is between the top and lower halves of the timing-cover and is very much in the way of working on the accessory belts, timing belt and water pump., The two toward the firewall of the auto are difficult to reach and even to see. Use a short, small ratchet drive extension., You probably can wiggle and jiggle the pulley while start gently prying and pulling it off the crankshaft. If not, then you may need to use a steering wheel puller or similar puller., This was necessary to be able to remove the lower timing cover., One screw is hard to see in the middle of the cover, right below the motor mount.,
 This article will describe construction of one that fits the center of the gable underneath the roof flashing. \n Rough sawn cedar is used in the images here for durability and appearance, but any weather resistant lumber can be used. If you want to get exact material requirements, you may need to produce a scale drawing with specific nominal dimension lumber lengths and sizes., See Things You'll Need for tools and other items, below. A table saw, a work table, a compound miter saw, and a finish nailer are very helpful for the project. \n Drawing it here to scale will allow for determining accurate lengths and angles, and to help you position the pieces together for fastening., 22.5 degrees is generally enough, but 30 or even 45 degrees may be preferred. If you measure carefully and cut with a table saw, you should be able to get two vanes from each board, assuming you are using 1X6 cedar fence boards. These will be the stock cut for vanes later., A miter saw is helpful in getting accurate angle cuts., You may want to scribe the inside dimension while doing this to make cutting the hole in the siding easier later on., The frame should be at least 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) deeper than the width of your vanes to make sure it doesn't leak., The width angle will be 45 degrees, the bevel should be about 30 degrees, with both long points facing the same direction and opposite the direction of the bevel on the edge of the stock., You can check the fit of the angles approximately at this time but until the opposite end is cut, it isn't possible to do exactly. \n Make scribed adjustments and check the angles on the saw so later cuts on the next vanes will all be the same. \n If it is ten inches shorter, you can reduce the length of subsequent vanes by the same amount to space them equally without measuring each one. \n Make sure each angle is cut so it faces the same way in relation to other angles and sort them by length., Use a finish nailer with corrosion resistant nails or corrosion resistant screws and a screw gun depending on your preference. Remember, the louver will be exposed to weather conditions, so it should be built securely to prevent wind damage that will result in leaks into your building., Staple it in place with 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) galvanized staples. Make sure to staple through the screen into the louver vanes to help prevent them from bowing or loosening.,
 There are many types of game shows on the market, and you need to decide which genre your show will belong to. Types of game shows include: \n Trivia games like Jeopardy and Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?Puzzle games like Playmania and ConcentrationWord games like Wheel of Fortune and The Last WordPhysical competition games like American Gladiators and Battle DomePerformance competition shows like American Idol and America’s Got Talent\n You need to find a way to set your show apart from all the other game shows on the market — you need to create an angle for yourself. The worst thing you can do is model yourself 100% off of an existing show, but you can mix and match aspects from different shows into a format unique to your own. \n Do your contestants win prize money or object prizes (like a car or a free trip to the Bahamas)? Maybe they win a donation to a charity of their choice, like many “celebrity” episodes of established game shows. \n You might narrow the scope of your game show to a specific theme: for example, a game show specifically about college football, aimed toward a sports-loving audience. \n Do your contestants get the opportunity to try to dig themselves out of a hole by fighting back over a series of rounds, or does the contestant with the lowest score get eliminated at the end of each round? \n You don’t want your game show to be over too quickly, but you don’t want it to drag on forever, either. At minimum, your game should last at least half an hour to ensure that enough questions get asked and answered to make the audience feel like they’ve had a satisfying experience. If your show goes over an hour in length, they might start getting bored and stop paying attention. \n By providing a little bit of structure to the competition, you give the competitive nature of the show a narrative arc. At the end of each round, the audience can measure where the contestants stand in relation to one another; this raises the tension as to who will ultimately win. \n Make sure each round is long enough to be fully developed — at least ten minutes each. The number of rounds will depend on the length of the show — a shorter show might have only two rounds, while a longer show might have four. \n The rounds should be roughly the same length in time. \n You can increase the point value for questions as rounds progress, making it more difficult for winners to maintain their lead and easier for the others to catch up; this increases the drama for the audience. \n You can have a final round that is significantly shorter in length, but provides an opportunity to the contestants to dramatically shift the final score. \n This might include a single question that is worth a large number or points, or perhaps allow contestants to wager how many points they’d like to risk on their final answer. \n Do you want your contestants to go into head-to-head individual competition, or do you want your show to pit teams of contestants against one another? If you’re going to have teams, do you want to randomly arrange teams from the pool of contestants, or have friends who already know each other apply together as a single team? \n All quiz games, from the weekly trivia game at your local bar to Jeopardy, divide their questions into themed categories. \n Categories can be as broad or specific as you like, but have a good mixture of the two. \n Examples of broad categories might include: science, history, music, or politics. \n Examples of more specific categories might include: endangered species, World War II, punk music, or U.S. presidents. \n Although you can repeat categories from time to time, vary them as much as possible between episodes. You don’t want contestants to be able to predict what types of questions you’re going to ask, and you don’t want your audience to get bored. \n A successful quiz show relies on the consistent production of high quality questions. It’s important that you have a large bank of questions to draw from, and that you do all the research necessary for the show ahead of time, so you don’t get caught unprepared. \n Develop more questions than you need. You can always save some questions for the future. This strategy also gives you to option to choose the best, most interesting questions from a larger pool rather than making do with the first handful of questions that came to mind. \n Work ahead of time. Don’t put off research for the last second, as you may run into a time crunch \n Organize a team of researchers. Draw on the strengths of each individual researcher and delegate specific categories to them. For example, researchers with scientific backgrounds should develop science-themed questions, which researchers with English backgrounds should develop literature-themed questions. \n Follow a research schedule. Don’t allow yourself to get off track during the week if you plan a weekly show. After delegating responsibility to your research team (or simply concretizing the categories for yourself), set deadlines for when questions will be due. \n For example, if you have a team, you might set a mid-week deadline for a pool of questions three times the size of what you need for the episode. Two days before the episode, you must winnow that pool down to the questions you will actually use that week. \n Although you can find websites where trivia-type questions are provided fairly easily, you should only use them as a last resort, because everyone has access to that same bank of generic questions.Audiences and contestants will be far more engaged with interesting, challenging questions that can’t be found in a generic trivia bank, but which you or your team found through thoughtful research. \n When developing your questions, keep your audience in mind. Steer clear of topics that might bore them; for example, an entire category devoted to the periodic table of elements might get tiresome. \n Consider who you’re writing this show for. Depending on your demographic, you’ll need to develop different strategies to attract viewer interest. \n If the show is geared toward teenagers, you can develop questions about pop music, movies, or young adult novels. \n If the show meant for people who wish to watch academically rigorous competition, focus on the types of subjects taught in university classes: philosophy, political science, etc. \n Questions about topical events and stories currently in the news can also make your viewers perk up. \n If the questions are consistently too difficult for your contestants to answer, you might see a decrease in potential contestants. Furthermore, the audience will likely grow bored with the show if contestants are consistently unable to field the questions. \n While it’s good to have challenging questions from time to time — ones that are designed to stump everyone — the majority of your questions should skirt the fine line between challenging and obscure. \n You can rank the questions within each category by difficulty, beginning with easier questions and building up to more difficult ones. \n Although the talent of your contestants is the real selling point in this genre of game show, you also want to vary the challenges enough to both keep them on their heels and keep your audience engaged. Before you even begin filming your pilot episode, plan out the challenges you want your contestants to complete for the entire season of your show. \n Many performance competition game shows focus on skills that have a revered tradition with well-loved classics. If your game show falls into this category, the people who watch your show might respond well to watching modern-day contestants pay homage to the tradition of their art. \n For a cooking game show, have contestants recreate classical dishes with a long tradition, such as chicken cordon bleu or a croquembouche.For a singing game show, have contestants sing old standards that demonstrate their ability to step into a song imbued with someone else’s legacy — Aretha Franklin’s “Chain of Fools” or Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York,” for example. \n While it takes a great deal of skill to execute a classical standard, asking your contestants to bring their own personality and point of view to a well-loved classic presents an interesting challenge. \n For a dancing game show, you might ask competitors to create new choreography for a song that has a beloved performance already associated with it — Gene Kelly’s performance of “Singing in the Rain,” for example., While you want to design many of your challenges to highlight your contestants’ creativity and innovation, showcasing their technical skills can also enthrall viewers. \n For a dancing game show, see how many pirouette turns dancers can do without losing their balance, for example. \n Sometimes, it’s hard to challenge a skilled batch of contestants. A good way to put pressure on them when challenging their technical abilities is to place a time restriction on their task. \n For a cooking game show, for example, you might see which contestant can Brunoise dice a pile of vegetables most quickly with an even cut., Though some of the challenges can be about technical proficiency, design other challenges to set contestants up in a way that allows them to showcase their personalities. \n On a cooking game show, you might ask contestants to cook a dish that speaks to them from their childhood. \n On a singing game show, you might challenge the contestants to compose their own songs rather than simply perform those of others. \n In some fields, such as singing and dancing, it may be more difficult to demonstrate innovation because the performers are not necessarily the ones composing or choreographing the pieces. However, if your show showcases a field where your contestants can push the envelope in their industry, design challenges that lead them toward innovation. \n For a fashion design game show, ask contestants to create an evening look geared toward women ten years from now. \n For a cooking show, ask contestants to deconstruct a simple dish or simplify a complex dish. \n Although you want your contestants to be able to demonstrate their own personalities and styles, you also want to see how they can adapt to a wide variety of constraints. \n For a dancing game show, have them work in styles from ballet to hip hop to classical Indian folk dance. \n Have cooking game show contestants cook vegan dishes one week, then break down and butcher sides of beef for their own steak dishes the next. \n There are a number of different ways you can test contestants’ strength in that are more entertaining than simply having them lift weights in a gym. Some examples might include: \n Putting them through a classic childhood exercise like a wheelbarrow race; not only do the contestants have to prove their arm strength over a long distance, but the audience can enjoy laughing along with grown contestants engaging in childish games.Recreate a fun state fair environment by having contestants throw balls at targets for prizes; however, the balls should be heavy medicine balls, and the targets should be far away. \n Use your imagination — there are any number of ways to have fun while challenging muscle strength. \n You can have them compete head on in simple racing heats, or you can make it a little more interesting by asking them to complete unrelated tasks during their race. For example, contestants sprint for 50 yards, solve a riddle that’s taped to a card at the 50 yard point, sprint back to the starting point, solve a math problem, sprint up a deck of stadium stairs, recite the alphabet backwards, then sprint back to the starting point. Again, you can jazz up the contest however you want, but you want to showcase your contestants’ speed. \n This skill set might have the most potential for entertainment value in a game show setting. You might have contestants engage in an old fashioned pie toss, a dunk tank, or an overgrown, amped up game of dodgeball. A bonus round challenge might be to award extra points to whichever contestant can hit a full-court basketball shot first. \n Obstacle courses raise the stakes by forcing contestants out of their comfort zone. You might set up a military-style outdoor obstacle course, with climbing walls, balance beams, lift-and-carry exercises, and dead sprints.You might aim instead for a funnier tone, booby-trapping contestants with water balloons or flour bombs at points throughout the obstacle course. \n The benefit of an obstacle course is that it tests many elements of your contestants’ fitness at the same time, rather than isolating strength from speed from coordination. \n Make sure your contestants are safe at all times. Use rubber pads on any hard walls or objects contestants might run into, and don’t aim projectiles at them that could inflict injury if it made contact. \n Whether you’re trying to sell your game show to a major network or local broadcast television, or even just filming it to upload on Youtube, you will need help from a team of people to make your game show a reality. You will need, at minimum: \n Camera operators — you need enough camera angles to show the host and all of the contestants. If you have individual contestants, you might just need two camera operators — one for the host and one for all of the contestants. However, if you have multiple teams, you might need a camera operator dedicated to each team. \n A production editor — someone who is familiar with video production software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut. \n A sound technician — someone who can ensure that the sound quality of all the dialogue on the show is picked up clearly. \n A charismatic host — the host you choose will set the tone for your show. Whether you pay someone, ask a friend to help you out, or go for it yourself, you need to make sure that the host brings a high level of energy to the proceedings \n The host should introduce each contestant by name, asking them to share a little about themselves. This biographical information can be cut and dry (“My name is Amy, and I’m an accountant for the city of Austin”) or more whimsical (“My name is Amy, and I have a cat who likes to go hiking with me on a leash every weekend”). \n Even if your show has been running for a while, you may have new viewers on a given week who are unfamiliar with it. It’s a good practice to introduce the show by briefly explaining the rules and format of the game at the top of each to make sure everyone knows what’s going on. \n Create a set script for the introductory rule explanation. This will both ensure that the rules are clearly stated every episode and create a comfortable, familiar segue into the episode for returning viewers. \n If this is a televised show, there will be consistent breaks for commercials — but even if your show is online, it’s a good idea to allow resting spots every once in a while, ideally between rounds. \n When a round ends, the host should recap the scores at that point in the game. \n This is a good time for the host to comment on how the game is going so far, or to ask the contestants how they’re feeling about their performance. \n These little breaks will give both the audience and the contestants time to reset for the next round of competition. \n If your show has a format that changes from round to round, make sure your host explains the new rules at the beginning of each round. You might have a stable format for each different round, like Jeopardy or Chopped, or you might have completely different challenges in each round from week to week, like Project Runway or Top Chef. \n The audience wants to like the people they’re watching, especially the host who remains a constant from episode to episode. Make sure the host is personable throughout, joking with contestants, complimenting them when they do something well, and allowing them to display their personalities. \n As each episode draws to a close, the host should thank the contestants for participating and congratulate the winner on their victory. Take a brief moment before the show ends to thank the audience for watching the show, and invite them to join you again for your next episode. Tell them the date, time, and channel on which the show appears so they know exactly when and where they can find the next episode. \n 
 Pour 20 grams (0.71 oz) or 1/4 of fresh henna powder into a plastic bowl. \n The paste will be thick, similar to toothpaste or mashed potatoes., Also add cajeput, tea tree and ravensara. Mix the ingredients thoroughly. The paste solution will become smooth and silky., Press the plastic wrap against the surface of the paste expelling any air pockets., Add more if needed. The henna paste should be smooth and creamy, similar to yogurt. The mehendi is now ready to be filled in a cone or bottle., Cut your chosen material (see Things You'll Need below) into a rectangular shape. \n Mylar wrap and cellophane wrap make beautiful cones. If you are using Mylar tissue, keep your hands well moisturized, as you cannot roll tissue Mylar if the humidity is low and your hands are dry, as too much static electricity makes the tissue unmanageable. \n Do not fill it up to the very top., Now the mehndi or henna cone is ready., A cone is one of the best tools for the professional henna artist. Cones allow you to make fine lines. You can hold a cone by nestling it between your thumb, palm and first finger. \n Try not to hold the cone or squeeze from the tip end, as this will weaken your control and the paste may spill out from the sides. \n Slowly squeeze the cone with the palm of your hand and fingers to create an even line of paste. \n For extra control, rest the weight of your hand on your little finger. \n You're now ready to start applying it. Use the cone to apply the design as chosen., Mix 1 teaspoon sugar with 3 teaspoons lemon juice to prepare the mixture. About twenty to thirty minutes after the paste is applied, the henna will lose its shine and the mud will dry and begin to crack. \n Apply the lemon and sugar mixture gently with a clean cotton patch to that part where henna has been applied; so that the henna does not get dry and fall off. This lemon sugar mixture will create protective “glue” between your skin and the henna. Be careful not to over saturate the paste as designs can run and bleed together. Apply the mixture 2 to 3 times. \n Wrapping need lots of absorbent tissue to wipe up the perspiration. \n Start wrapping tissues around your hand like a mummy. \n Wrap plastic over the tissues. \n Tape the wrap down with packing tape. \n Before you are ready to remove the paste and wraps, hold the area over steam for 10 minutes. A pot of boiling water or tea kettle works well or heat 2 to 3 cloves on an iron pan and put your hands over its fumes. The extra heat and steam help to deepen the stain color., After the paste has been on your skin for 6 – 12 hours it is ready to be removed. Peel off wrappings and scrape off the paste. Using a paper towel and vegetable oil (corn, olive, and canola) or lemon juice, gently rub off the dried henna paste if it is sticking to the skin. Do not use water to remove the paste, it can ruin the tattoo., Once you have unwrapped and removed the dry henna paste you will see an orange-yellow tattoo stain left on your skin. The tattoo will deepen into a richer reddish-brown tone over the next 48 hours. \n The final color is reddish brown and can last anywhere from one to three weeks depending on the quality and type of henna paste applied, as well as where it was applied on the body (thicker skin stains darker and longer than thin skin). Moisturizing with natural oils, such as olive, sesame seed, or coconut, will also help extend the lifetime of the tattoo, as skin exfoliation is what causes the henna tattoo to fade. \n It is best to avoid water for the first 24 hours. \n Corn, canola, or olive oil all work well. Avoid using any petroleum products such as baby oil or Vaseline as they will contribute to the demise of your stain. \n Avoid excess rubbing of the area. \n Avoid shaving over your henna/mehendi stain. Shaving removes layers of skin. \n The color becomes darker within 2 hours. But that color will only last for 2 days. It is the last possible remedy. Wash your hands with liquid soap to keep the mehendi design for a longer period. Avoid too much rinsing of the hands.
 It would be helpful if it added up to 100%. This article will provide example data and you can substitute in your own. Above is a picture of the finished example. \n Double click on Excel (either the green X on the dock or the app title in the folder) and select File New Workbook., In General, set R1C1 to unchecked or Off; in Ribbon, set Ribbon to checked or On; and in View, set Show Formula Bar by Default to checked or On., Then Hit OK., Center., The $ signs in "$P$20" make hat an "absolute reference" that does not change automatically as you copy and paste the formula to other cells. \n "Relative references" (those without dollar signs) do change automatically. Recommended: investigate the results of the next step in each cell to learn the difference between relative and absolute references. \n The pie chart will appear with the top right area showing 18% of the chart for Camels; the next right area will be 10% for Elephants and the area next clockwise down will be 10% for Hippos, and the next (largest area on the boom) will be 35% for Monkeys. You have successfully created the pie chart you wanted., Hover the mouse over the corners or edges until the mouse cursor turns into a double-headed arrow and then pull to expand or push to shrink the chart to that it looks good beside your data, and will print out nicely if you are opting to print your work., There is a way to substitute the categories for the category numbers given beside the series colors in the chart legend: \n Click inside the chart right on one of the chart sections itself and notice up in the formula bar that the following formula appears =SERIES(,Sheet1!$N$12:$N$19,1). \n If you modify it to read =SERIES(,{"Camels","Elephants", "Hippopotami","Monkeys","Rhinoceri","Spiders","Tigers","Lions"},Sheet1!$N$12:$N$19,1), then the category names will be substituted for the automatic category list-numbers. This is an array. Yes it's a pain but each category must be in quotes w/ no spaces, separated by commas and the whole in braces. \n You may want to resize the legend a bit to correct for formatting problems. \n 
 You should always prepare your hair for cornrows/weave prior to executing the style. Wash your hair as you normally do, and give it a good conditioning treatment as well. Make sure that your hair is totally dry before starting the cornrow process.\n To create the base to sew your weave onto, you have to braid your head in a series of cornrows. To do this, you’ll need a wide tooth comb, a fine tooth comb, and a hair pick. You will also need 2-3 large hair clips to hold your hair away from your face, and a detangle spray of some sort (3 parts water mixed with 1 part oil in a spray bottle works well). \n When you add your weave, you’ll place it in layers around a part in your natural hair. Your part is the exposed area of the scalp, and is typically located down the center of your head or slightly off-center. Choose the location of the part, and separate out ½-inch sections of hair on either side of it. Pin the rest of your hair back using the clips. \n Your part only needs to go about halfway back on your head. \n To show your part, you will braid two rows of hair on either side of the part, away from each other. Start with one of the ½ inch sections of hair, and separate a small piece about ¼ of an inch thick on one of the ends. Braid this in a french braid towards the ear on the same side of the part. Braid this strand about ⅔ of the way down, leaving the ends loose (they will be incorporated into a larger braid later on). \n Work down both sides of the part, braiding small french braids ¼-inch wide. Remember that the braids should always go towards the ear on the side of the part they are on; this will expose the straight part down the center. Because you won’t be able to french braid each strand all the way, the ends should stick out after you’ve braided all the hair near the scalp. Each of the strands that are sticking out will be the start of a row of braids going all the way around your head. \n The first braid you will complete is a small braid that wraps around the outer edge of your face, head, and to the nape of your neck. The perimeter braid will have two starts - on either side of the part - but you will combine the ends of the braids together at the nape of your neck. Take your hair out of the hair clips, and section off a strand of hair ¼-½ inch thick all the way around the outer edge of your head. Starting with the edge-braid from your part, braid as far as you can around the edge of your head. Then, do the same on the other side. \n You might combine the perimeter braids off to the side rather than directly in the center on the nape of your neck, if your part is off-center. \n Keep the braid as tight as you can, and as close to your scalp as you’re able. \n Each of the braids you began on either side of your part will continue on to form full braids that wrap around your head. This means that from a birds-eye-view of your completed head, there will be concentric circles formed around your part. Follow the pattern of the perimeter braid, by sectioning off thin pieces of hair around the outer edge and working in. Go to the next braid closest to your hairline, and braid on either side of your part towards the back of your head. \n Continue spraying your hair with the oil/water mixture or your detangler spray to make braiding easier. \n Your braids should be very tight and may hurt while braiding, but shouldn’t be painful when completed. \n The braids will likely become quite thick about halfway through, because of all the hair you gather. Don’t be worried if because of this your braids are uneven. \n Work inwards on your braids, away from your part. Each of the small braids you started on either side of your part should serve as the start for each new braid. If you run out of part-braids though, you can create more near the part on the back of your head. Tie off all the ends and tuck them into/under the finished braids so as to hide the tails. \n For your weave, you’ll at need at least two packages of wefts of human hair in a color coordinating your natural hue. You’ll also need curved sewing needles, weave thread that matches the hair color, a wig cap, and a pick or fine tooth comb for separating sections of hair. When you finish weaving in a weft of hair, you’ll cut the excess with a pair of shears, so have those on hand as well. \n Get your special weave-thread out, and cut a piece that is 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) long. Thread one end of the string through your needle, and pull it so that both ends are even. Then, wrap the ends of the thread around the tip of your finger, and tie them together in a knot. This will form a loop on which your needle is strung. Cut the excess thread off that is left over from tying your knot; try to cut it as close to the knot as you are able, so as to make it as discreet as possible when woven into your hair. \n Don’t cut too much thread to start, as the longer your thread, the more tangles and knots that are likely to be formed. \n You’ll probably run out of thread often, so you’ll have to repeat the aforementioned process each time that happens. \n Pull your wig cap out and stretch it out, sliding it over your head. Cover your entire hairline all the way around; the wig cap should go over your ears, forehead, and the nape of your neck as bit so as to make sure your braids are completely covered. \n Start at the beginning of your perimeter braid near the part, and pull the needle under the braid and through the other side, pulling the thread taut against the knot. Then, pull the end of the knot out just a bit and pull the two strings apart to expose the loop. Wrap the needle around one edge of the loop twice, and pull it through the center of the loop to create the base knot. \n Measure about 1-inch down the perimeter braid from the first knot you made, and repeat the process. Hook the needle under the braid, pull it through the other side, and tug to pull the loose thread tight. Before the thread between the two knots has been tightened all the way though, wrap the needle around it twice near where you inserted it, and pull tight. This will give you your second knot. Repeat this same process all the way around the perimeter braid. \n Each knot should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart from each other. \n Make sure that your knots and thread are pulled tight, so that your cap is firmly attached to your braids. \n When you’ve sewn the wig cap around the perimeter braid, you’ll complete the ‘loop’ by sewing around the outside of your part. Starting from your last knot on the perimeter braid, skip up to the next row of braids on your head. Repeat the knot-tying process, and then go up to the next row. By the time you’ve sewn around the part, you should have a large ‘U’ shape of knots. Make sure that each knot is at least 1-inch away from the center part. Finish off by tying two knots at the base of your sewing, where you started on the perimeter braid. \n The finishing knots should be the same as the other knots you’ve been sewing the whole time. \n Cut the extra string off as close to the knot as you are able, without cutting the knot. \n Take your shears and cut up along your part to split the wig cap. You’ll be removing all the excess fabric around the edge of your sewing (the part that went over your forehead, ears, nape of your neck, and the covers your part). Once you’ve cut up your part, cut all the extra fabric off as close to the edge of your thread as possible, without getting close enough to cut the knots. \n If you accidentally cut the thread or a knot, you’ll have to remove what work you’ve done and start over with a new wig cap. \n The first extension that you will measure and apply is the piece that goes around the perimeter. Take your extensions out of the package, and open one weft so that all the hair is exposed. Starting at the beginning of your perimeter braid, hold the extension in place, and wrap it around your head. Hold it to the perimeter braid the entire time to make sure it is the right length. When you get to the end of the perimeter braid on the other side, measure a little extra hair, and then trim it to fit. \n Place this piece of perimeter-extension off to the side, so that you don’t misplace it or confuse it for another section of hair. \n The second major section of hair you need to measure is the piece that will go around the ‘U’ shape of your part. Hold the end of the extension over the beginning of the ‘U’ shaped part near your forehead, and wrap it around where you have already knotted. When you get to the end on the other side (back to your forehead), add a little extra length to your measurement, and then cut the piece of extension. \n Keep track of this extension, and make sure you don’t confuse it with the perimeter extension. \n You’re going to be working with a long strip of extension, but you won’t be able to use all the necessary thread in a single shot. Cut a piece of your weave thread that is 5–6 feet (1.5–1.8 m) long, and use the same process as you did for your wig cap by threading it through the needle, matching the ends, and tying them together in a knot. Cut off any excess string. \n Every time you section out a new piece of extension to sew on, you’ll have to create a knot to secure it. The extension is made up of two primary parts: the strands of hair, and the weft which holds them together. Stick your needle through the weft at the very beginning of the extension to secure it. To tie your first knot, you’ll wrap the needle around, pull it through the weft a second time, wrap the loop that is formed around the needle twice, and pull the needle through. \n The knotting process involved is the same as you used to sew your wig cap to your cornrows. \n You should have plenty of excess thread when you’re finished tying your not; don’t cut this, as you will be using it to weave your extension to your head. \n Start at the very beginning of your perimeter braid near your part, and insert the needle through the wig cap, under the perimeter braid, and up through the other side. Pull it tight to bring your extension piece close to your head. Then, make your first knot by wrapping the needle/thread around the weft (not through it) and repeating the same knotting process as you used for sewing your cap. Repeat your knot twice to secure the extension. \n You’ll only double-knot the extension at the very beginning. \n Using the exact same process as you did to sew on the wig cap, work around your head sewing on the extensions that attach to the perimeter braid. Make each knot about 1-inch apart, and hold the extensions taut so that they are securely attached to your head. Do this all the way around your perimeter braid until you’ve made it to the very end, on the opposite side of your part. \n Be careful not to tie strands of hair into the knot. \n Trim off any excess that you might have once you have completed sewing on the perimeter extension. \n To finish off the ‘border’ of your hair, you’ll have to sew your extension piece around the edge of the ‘U’ shape that your wig cap forms around your part. Start by preparing a new piece of thread and attaching it to the end of the weft. Then use the exact same process as explained above to sew the extension to the braids/wig cap around your part. \n Trim off any extra that you might have at the end. \n Starting at the second row of braids (the second to the perimeter braids) you should begin filling in the space on your head with the rest of your extensions. Continue the same process as above, except that when you get to the end of your row (on the opposite side of the perimeter braid), you should use the ‘fold over’ method to begin an additional row. This means that instead of cutting off the excess extension when you reach the end of a row, you fold it back on itself and begin sewing the new row directly above it. \n Always sew a knot directly over a fold when you fold over a section, in order to make it lay flat. It is helpful to do this twice, to make sure it is 100% secure. \n Don’t measure and cut your pieces prior to sewing additional rows, because the fold-over method will make it easier to continue working with the same weft for a large portion of your head. \n Work around your head, using the exact same process of sewing your weave to your cap/braids as you have been. Remember to always double knot over a fold or the beginning of a weft, to properly secure it. When you have finished filling in your head, trim off any excess that might hang over the front., If you’ve done all of your sewing correctly so far, you should be left with about 1-inch of exposed braids all the way around your part. Sewing your weave onto this section is similar to when you originally braided it, as you will be working with small sections away from the part. Measure the exposed braid, and cut off the same amount of your weave. Sew each small section (about 1-inch wide) onto the exposed braid. This means that you will have many small pieces to sew, and each should run somewhat parallel to your forehead. Use the exact same process, making sure to double-knot both the beginning and end of each thread. \n It might be helpful to have several needles with thread prepared before starting this, because you’ll be working with so many small pieces of weave which may be difficult to do with a single long piece of thread. \n As the layers build, your part should look more and more natural, and the weft of each piece of extension should begin to be covered up. \n When you’ve sewn on extensions to all the small braids along your part, you should be left with a space in the back that is still open. To fill this in, you’ll have to prepare a special piece of your weave. Measure the space that you have to fill, and cut a piece of your weave that is twice that length. Start with your regular double knot at the end, and then roll the weave in to create a small circle. Create an additional knot by looping around the two layered sections of weft, and pulling it tight. Continue rolling and knotting the extension until you have finished the whole piece. \n When you tie the last knot, pull the needle through all of the layered wefts to secure them together. \n Cut the excess string off when you’re finished tying it. \n Turn your closure piece upside down so that the weft is facing the ground, and the hair is upwards. Begin flattening the hair so that it falls down over the top of the rolled up weft. Because of the roll that you created, the hair should fall evenly around it, hiding the weft and your sewing. It may be helpful to use a flat iron on the hair to get it to cooperate with what you’re trying to get it to do. \n Secure the ends of the hair with a small elastic to making sewing it to your scalp much easier. \n Turn your closure piece back over so that the weft is exposed, and insert your needle and thread through it to tie your regular double knot. Bring your closure to your scalp, and place it where you want it to go. Insert your needle through a braid or a piece of weft from another extension nearby on your scalp, and pull it tight to create your regular knot. Continue doing this in a circular movement around your closure piece, until you’ve gotten back to the beginning. \n Cut off the excess string, remove the elastic from your hair, and you’re done! \n Adjust the strands of your closure piece to cover up any weft that may be visible. \n Attaching your weave to your head is now completed, so you have the option of cutting and styling it to your personal preference. Keep in mind that your cut is permanent since your hair isn’t going to grow in, so be very careful about cutting your hair. Maintain your weave regularly, but avoid washing it too often as this may loosen up the ties and your wig cap. \n

 This will come with a huge power wire, a short ground wire, a remote wire, and many times an inline fuse and various connectors to help keep the install organized and looking clean. Some stereo shops have huge spools of wire available by the foot. This is another cost effective alternative to buying a wiring kit, if you know the dimensions of your car.\n You can find a hole somewhere in the bottom right of the firewall. Don't connect the power wire to the battery or the amp just yet. \n You'll need to stay within 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) of the amplifier to maintain the best ground connection. A way you can do this is pull up the carpet and scrape the metal until it is bare metal with no paint left on it. If the amplifier is to be mounted in the trunk, many times bolts from the suspension can be found directly above one of the rear wheels. These suspension components usually bolt directly to the frame, making them an ideal grounding point. \n There is a blue wire with a white stripe hanging out of the back of the deck known as the remote wire. The remote wire is a simple 12v signal that the cd player outputs to tell the amplifier to turn on. \n If your cd player does not have a "Subwoofer Output", or if you are using a stock cd player, you will need a device called an inline converter. It's a small box that has 4 input wires and the 2 necessary RCA output that will run to the amplifier. It takes the high level speaker voltage and drops it to a low level signal the amplifier can process. The 4 input wires can be connected to the rear speakers (+ and - for left and right). \n RCA cables should be run down the center of the car as RCA cables can pick up sounds from wire looms and also air con vents power wires. \n Gauge isn't extremely important here, as long as the wire is copper, the resistance-per-foot is in the mili-ohm range, meaning there will be minuscule, if any, voltage drop across the wire. \n There are many different types of enclosures (sealed, vented, bandpass, infinite baffle, etc.). There are numerous articles explaining the pros and cons of each type of enclosure, far too many to list in this article. If you really want the best response possible, your subwoofer manual will list the ideal enclosure volume for each type of enclosure. If you don't want to go through all of the volume calculations, just buy a box slightly bigger, and stuff it with pillow stuffing from walmart until the subs respond the way you want them to. \n For example, if you have an amp that is 500w @ 4 ohms, and 1000w @ 2 ohms, you'll want to try to run your speakers at 2 ohms. Two 4 ohm subs can be wired in parallel to achieve this. If you're new to the impedance calculations, many amplifiers will have specific wiring diagrams in their manuals to assist. \n If your amp kit came with an "inline fuse holder", you'll want to find a nice location to mount it in your engine bay. Once it's secure, cut a length of the power wire to reach the fuse, and connect it to one side of the fuse holder. The other side (the side you just cut) is stripped and connected to the other side of the fuse holder. \n There's nice ring connectors and even new battery terminals you can buy (and sometimes come with the amp kit), that make the battery connection much more solid, and looks better too. \n Then under the hood clamp the wire down to the battery. A word of warning, sometimes you'll see a nice big spark the first time you touch the power wire to the battery. Don't worry about it! This is the amplifier charging the huge capacitors contained inside. \n This is where the output of the amplifier peaks and stays there for a split-second. This is bad for the subwoofer because it holds the cone (the big circle part!) in it's fully extended or fully compressed state for the duration of the clip. Not only are you not producing a single decibel of sound during this microsecond, but you're also working the voice coil very hard and damaging it. A good rule for beginners is to play a nice loud song of your genre at your cd players 3/4 volume setting. Now, with the gain at zero, turn it up until it's obvious that it isn't getting any louder. The gain knob isn't a "volume" knob by any means. A gain knob should usually never be at it's full position. \n 
 If you need to, read How to Install GIMP. \n The size you select depends largely on your purpose. Banner advertisements are generally between 60 and 120 pixels tall and 400 to 800 pixels wide. Different website software and banner exchange systems will list their own requirements. For buttons, the height is generally not more than 40 pixels, and the width is usually less than 300 pixels. Separators, accents, widgets, doodads, and thingamabobs that you want to build have no restriction except the question of how much drive space and bandwidth do you want to use up? \n In this tutorial, we will select 200 pixels for width and 20 for height, then click OK. GIMP will give you a nice white little rectangle.\n Each Layer we create will be a 'frame' in the animation. \n Select a dark red color for the Horizontal and Vertical grid lines, then click OK. \n Now right click the layer named 'Background copy' and select Layer Properties to rename it to something simple like 'Frame 1'. \n Some animations lend themselves to several variations, and saving a framework will save a ton of time making those variations. Use GIMP's internal .xcf format for this base file, such as "LightBarBase.xcf". \n "LightBarSave.xcf" \n Doing this last allows you to replace mistakes and extend the animation if you choose to by duplicating the background, but at the end it usually isn't needed for the animation. \n GIMP will ask if you want to Merge Visible Layers or Save as Animation. Select "Save as Animation" and click "Export"(NOTE: In new version of GIMP, You cannot use "Save As" command for GIF format, You may use export menu instead of Save As). \n Higher number equals slower animation. (NOTE: In new version of GIMP, Comments and frames option is available in export dialogue box itself). \n Your new animated .gif has been created! \n 
 We see that the integrand is a product of two functions, so it is ideal for us to integrate by parts. \n ∫xexdx{\displaystyle \int xe^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x} \n \n \n ∫udv=uv−∫vdu{\displaystyle \int u{\mathrm {d} }v=uv-\int v{\mathrm {d} }u} \n We choose u=x{\displaystyle u=x} because its derivative of 1 is simpler than the derivative of ex,{\displaystyle e^{x},} which is only itself. That results in dv=exdx,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }v=e^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x,} whose integral is trivial. \n du=dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u={\mathrm {d} }x} \n v=ex{\displaystyle v=e^{x}} \n In general, integration of parts is a technique that aims to convert an integral into one that is simpler to integrate. If you see a product of two functions where one is a polynomial, then setting u{\displaystyle u} to be the polynomial will most likely be a good choice. \n You can neglect the constant of integration when finding v,{\displaystyle v,} because it will drop out in the end. \n \n ∫xexdx=xex−∫exdx{\displaystyle \int xe^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x=xe^{x}-\int e^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x} \n The result was that our integral now consists of just one function - the exponential function. As ex{\displaystyle e^{x}} is its own antiderivative with a constant, evaluating it is much easier. \n Remember to add the constant of integration, as antiderivatives are not unique. \n ∫xexdx=xex−ex+C{\displaystyle \int xe^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x=xe^{x}-e^{x}+C} \n Definite integrals require evaluation at the boundaries. While the integral below looks like it has an integrand of just one function, the inverse tangent function, we can say that it is the product of inverse tangent and 1. \n ∫01tan−1⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}\tan ^{-1}x{\mathrm {d} }x} \n \n ∫abudv=uv|ab−∫abvdu{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}u{\mathrm {d} }v=uv{\Bigg |}_{a}^{b}-\int _{a}^{b}v{\mathrm {d} }u} \n Since the derivative of an inverse trig function is algebraic and therefore simpler, we set u=tan−1⁡x{\displaystyle u=\tan ^{-1}x} and dv=dx.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }v={\mathrm {d} }x.} This results in du=11+x2dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {1}{1+x^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x} and v=x.{\displaystyle v=x.} \n \n ∫01tan−1⁡xdx=xtan−1⁡x|01−∫01x1+x2dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}\tan ^{-1}x{\mathrm {d} }x=x\tan ^{-1}x{\Bigg |}_{0}^{1}-\int _{0}^{1}{\frac {x}{1+x^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x} \n The numerator is proportional to the derivative of the denominator, so u-subbing is ideal. \n Let u=1+x2.{\displaystyle u=1+x^{2}.} Then du=2xdx.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u=2x{\mathrm {d} }x.} Be careful in changing your boundaries. \n ∫01x1+x2dx=12∫121udu=12ln⁡2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{0}^{1}{\frac {x}{1+x^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x&={\frac {1}{2}}\int _{1}^{2}{\frac {1}{u}}{\mathrm {d} }u\\&={\frac {1}{2}}\ln 2\end{aligned}}} \n Be careful with the signs. \n ∫01tan−1⁡xdx=π4−12ln⁡2{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}\tan ^{-1}x{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{4}}-{\frac {1}{2}}\ln 2} \n Occasionally, you may find yourself with an integral that requires multiple instances of integration by parts in order to get the desired answer. Such an integral is below. \n ∫excos⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int e^{x}\cos x{\mathrm {d} }x} \n \n ∫udv=uv−∫vdu{\displaystyle \int u{\mathrm {d} }v=uv-\int v{\mathrm {d} }u} \n As one of the functions is the exponential function, setting that as u{\displaystyle u} will get us nowhere. Instead, let u=cos⁡x{\displaystyle u=\cos x} and dv=exdx.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }v=e^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x.} What we find is that the second derivative of u{\displaystyle u} is simply the negative of itself. That is, d2dx2cos⁡x=−cos⁡x.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}\cos x=-\cos x.} This means that we need to integrate by parts twice to get an interesting result. \n du=−sin⁡x{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u=-\sin x} \n v=ex{\displaystyle v=e^{x}} \n \n ∫excos⁡xdx=excos⁡x−∫−exsin⁡xdx=excos⁡x+∫exsin⁡xdx{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int e^{x}\cos x{\mathrm {d} }x&=e^{x}\cos x-\int -e^{x}\sin x{\mathrm {d} }x\\&=e^{x}\cos x+\int e^{x}\sin x{\mathrm {d} }x\end{aligned}}} \n Be careful with the signs. \n u=sin⁡x,dv=exdx,du=cosxdx,v=ex{\displaystyle u=\sin x,\,{\mathrm {d} }v=e^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x,\,{\mathrm {d} }u=\cos {x}{\mathrm {d} }x,\,v=e^{x}} \n ∫exsin⁡xdx=exsin⁡x−∫excos⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int e^{x}\sin x{\mathrm {d} }x=e^{x}\sin x-\int e^{x}\cos x{\mathrm {d} }x} \n ∫excos⁡xdx=excos⁡x+exsin⁡x−∫excos⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int e^{x}\cos x{\mathrm {d} }x=e^{x}\cos x+e^{x}\sin x-\int e^{x}\cos x{\mathrm {d} }x} \n In this problem, what we have found is that by performing integration by parts twice, the original integral came up in the work. Instead of performing integration by parts endlessly, which will get us nowhere, we can solve for it instead. Don't forget the constant of integration at the very end. \n 2∫excos⁡xdx=excos⁡x+exsin⁡x∫excos⁡xdx=12excos⁡x+12exsin⁡x+C{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}2\int e^{x}\cos x{\mathrm {d} }x&=e^{x}\cos x+e^{x}\sin x\\\int e^{x}\cos x{\mathrm {d} }x&={\frac {1}{2}}e^{x}\cos x+{\frac {1}{2}}e^{x}\sin x+C\end{aligned}}} \n We shall call this function G(x),{\displaystyle G(x),} where G{\displaystyle G} is any function that satisfies G′=g.{\displaystyle G^{\prime }=g.} \n Since this is a product of two functions, we use the product rule. Sharp minds will intuitively see the resulting integration by parts formula as closely related to the product rule, just as u-substitution is the counterpart to the chain rule. \n ddxfG=fG′+f′G=fg+f′G{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}fG&=fG^{\prime }+f^{\prime }G\\&=fg+f^{\prime }G\end{aligned}}} \n The above expression says that fG{\displaystyle fG} is the antiderivative of the right side, so we integrate both sides to recover the integral of the left side. \n ∫(fg+f′G)dx=fG{\displaystyle \int (fg+f^{\prime }G){\mathrm {d} }x=fG} \n \n ∫fgdx=fG−∫f′Gdx{\displaystyle \int fg{\mathrm {d} }x=fG-\int f^{\prime }G{\mathrm {d} }x} \n The goal of integration by parts is seen in the expression above. We are integrating f′G{\displaystyle f^{\prime }G} instead of fg,{\displaystyle fg,} and if used correctly, this results in a simpler evaluation. \n We let u=f,v=G,du=f′dx,dv=gdx.{\displaystyle u=f,\,v=G,\,{\mathrm {d} }u=f^{\prime }{\mathrm {d} }x,\,{\mathrm {d} }v=g{\mathrm {d} }x.} \n ∫udv=uv−∫vdu{\displaystyle \int u{\mathrm {d} }v=uv-\int v{\mathrm {d} }u} \n In general, there is no systematic process by which we can make the integral easier to evaluate. However, it is often the case that we want a u{\displaystyle u} whose derivative is easier to manage, and a dv{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }v} that can easily be integrated. \n For definite integrals, it is easy to show that the formula holds when writing the boundaries for all three terms, though it is important to remember that the boundaries are limits on the variable x.{\displaystyle x.} \n ∫abudv=uv|ab−∫abvdu{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}u{\mathrm {d} }v=uv{\Bigg |}_{a}^{b}-\int _{a}^{b}v{\mathrm {d} }u} \n 
 Don't do it in a hurry in the morning. Check with a family member if you need approval or advice on fashion or making sure your clothing matches.\n Don't drink sodas with caffeine in them. You won't be able to get to sleep. \n It'll help you work off some stress, and it will help you sleep better. \n Remember to give yourself time in the morning to eat. A leisurely breakfast will also help you gather your thoughts and arrive at school calm and ready. \n You could meet them at school, or you could walk to school with them, if they live nearby. \n Save yourself the trouble of any morning rushes. \n You may even want multiple alarm clocks, just in case you don't wake up. You may still be used to the summer schedule of waking up late. Sleeping in on the first day is something you should avoid, as you might miss a few hours of important introductions. \n You may ask a parent, guardian, or older sibling who's gone to the grade you are starting. \n If you're new to a school, go before school starts and get a feel for where things are and how far apart they are. If you don't have time for this step, though, don't worry. Everybody else is going to be new there, too, so it's no big deal to ask questions, wander into the wrong room, and so on, especially for the first few days. \n Take a sleeping pill if you have to. You don't want to stay up all night worrying about everything. \n
 Butter is best fresh, and in a perfect world, you'd purchase and consume the butter weekly.However, this isn't realistic for many people, so the key is to stick to small amounts, and fast consumption, fitting this in with your usual shopping routine. If you have found butter for a bargain price and don't want to overlook the savings, consider freezing the bulk of any excess butter. \n Butter easily absorbs the odors of other foods, thus it's important to provide a guard against this possibility., Alternatively, if you don't wish to wrap the butter, place it straight into the sealed container in its original packaging; the seal will prevent the transfer of odors and exposure to air. \n Left unopened, salted butter will keep for several weeks., Once you start to use it, aim to work through it quickly. \n While butter can be frozen as a whole block, it is probably more useful to cut it into usable chunk sizes, which will make it easier to thaw quickly and provide just the amount you need each time. \n Ensure that the foil completely covers the butter and overlaps for added protection. \n Alternatively, place it inside a freezer-proof container which is airtight., Unsalted butter has a shelf life of three months in the refrigerator (unopened), while it can be frozen for up to six months.Once opened, it will keep for two to three weeks in the refrigerator., If you cannot consume it within this time, you will need to freeze the unsalted butter, to ensure that it stays fresh for longer. \n Wrap the butter well in foil to avoid other flavors from mingling with it. \n Before wrapping, consider cutting it into smaller chunks that you can remove for use as needed. \n Place a resealable freezer bag over it to prevent odor penetration. \n Place in the freezer. Keep it away from any frozen food that might impart a strong odor. As noted, unsalted butter will keep for up to six months in the freezer. \n Butter spoils quickly at room temperature, due to its high water content., The salt as a preservative will help the butter to stay fresher a little longer. \n Store it in a cool, dark and dry cupboard or pantry when not in use. When on the table, keep the lid of the butter dish on when the butter is not being used. \n Air is the source of turning butter rancid. Hence, keeping the lid on helps to slow down this process.If you like the idea of room temperature storage, consider getting a European storage crock. These come with a water seal that keeps the air out, the moisture in and retains the freshness of the butter for longer (up to two weeks).Inquire about this at your local kitchen store, or check online for providers. \n The butter will go rancid very quickly. For room temperature butter when it is hot, remove only the needed amount from the refrigerator a half hour to an hour before use and place in the butter dish/keeper; leave to warm at room temperature, with the lid firmly on. Then transfer to the table. Discard what has not been consumed at that meal. \n Ghee has had the milk solids removed. This means that it is less likely to go rancid and has a longer shelf life. \n Provided the room temperature is normal and not too hot, and you intend on using the ghee quickly, it is usually fine to store it at room temperature.If ghee has been made properly and is stored properly, it is possible to store it at room temperature for several decades.However, this is not advisable, as foods are best consumed within a short period of time of their production. If any moisture or milk solids remain in the ghee, it will not store well for a long period of time; it must be pure butter fat for it to stay fresh at room temperature.The container used to hold the ghee must be airtight, opaque and waterproof.Pickling crocks or porcelain jars/earthenware jars can be used for short-term room temperature storage.Colored glass jars or commercially specific hermetically sealed containers can be used for longer-term room temperature ghee storage., For long-term freshness and absolute certainty, it is a good idea to keep ghee refrigerated, especially once opened, and especially if you've made it yourself.Ensure that it is in an airtight container; it will still absorb the odors of aromatic foods around it. \n
 especially the section about physically removing the starter from the engine compartment. This should help you decide whether to take the vehicle into service vs doing this yourself. \n You will be in and under the wheel well most of the time., you can remove the plastic rivets with a large screwdriver or stretch the rubber guards over the heads of the rivets., (just aft of the strut). The starter will not fit through this space without moving this brake line first., It is held in place by an O ring. twist and pull the upper section up. It comes out reasonably easy, plug the top of the bottom section with a paper towel as to not contaminate the transmission fluid., You will have to go under the truck and come in from behind the starter through a maze of brake lines etc. The swivel headed ratchet makes this job MUCH easier. Using a 12 to 14 inch (30.5 to 35.6 cm) extension and the same 14mm socket and swivel ratchet remove the top bolt., Depress the plastic locking key and slide the plug out. Fortunately this removed easy, because there is little room to maneuver and no room to use pliers. If you had to use force there is no room for leverage., THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE JOB. I was unable to do it myself and ended up having a Toyota Service supervisor come to my home and assist me. He said only two of his three techs are able to perform this task. The starter needs to be removed gears first, through the wheel well opening, it needs to be lifted (gears up) and rotated toward the opening so that it is removed not quite horizontally. As the starter is moved toward the opening it has to be rotated so the positive battery lead bolt can clear obstructions. The starter is then advanced in position and rotated opposite direction. Advance the starter in position and wiggle it in position until it can be removed. This is MUCH more difficult than it sounds. As I said I was unable to perform this task., You will need an impact driver to take the starter apart and check the bushes (also called lunge contacts). The brushes are usually just over an inch long and spring-loaded, if they appear to have plenty of carbon left then look to your stator. Bluish burns on the copper windings indicate bad spots, and the starter should be replaced. As difficult as this job was, replacing the starter is worth every dime. After market starters are approx. $100. Toyota I believe is closer to $300., wiggle it around until it goes into the engine compartment, maneuver the starter until the gears go into the flywheel housing then line it up and push it into place. It is difficult to tell whether the gears and flywheel mesh, but rotate the starter back and forth and the gears should mesh. Using a 12–14 inch (30.5–35.6 cm) flat piece of anything, prop the starter up so that you may start the bolts into the starter housing. I had better success with the lower bolt first, and pulling the starter up to the flywheel housing cautiously to check the gear mesh. Leave the lower bolt loose and start the top bolt. After re-installing the starter, I had difficulty tightening this top bolt. I was able to reach this bolt through the wheel well (with no extension or flex socket) for final tightening. Tighten the bolts checking the gap between the flywheel housing and the starter to ensure the gears meshed properly. If they are coming together unevenly remove either bolt, loosen the other bolt and rotate the starter back and forth until it goes into place. The limited access to the starter makes this process more difficult because of lack of mobility of the starter. Repeat the re-bolting process, and tighten down the bolts. I do not know the torque values if any. I use the tight is tight, too tight is broke, method., Rebolt the brake line bracket, replace the negative battery lead and start the truck. If the truck starts, shut it off, remove the jack stands, replace the wheel, remove the jack and tighten down the wheel bolts.
 If you plan on driving, don’t drink enough alcohol to raise your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08, which is the legal level for intoxication in every state., Consider using an online calculator, such as the one available at this link. Factors influencing BAC include your gender, weight, and what type of alcohol you drink.The calculator can be a useful tool, but don’t rely on it to be completely accurate. \n Medications affect people differently, so make sure that any prescription (or non-prescription) drugs you take won’t impair your ability to drive., Instead of risking a DUI, call a taxi or ask a friend or family member to pick you up if you’re too impaired to drive. The consequences of a DUI conviction far outweigh the cost of a cab ride. \n Every state has laws that govern driving under the influence. There are certain basic DUI elements that you’ll find in these laws, such as: \n BAC intoxication levels, some of which can trigger stiffer penalties \n the possibility of jail time \n fines \n the possibility of suspension or restriction of driving privileges., This will enable you to learn the specifics of what constitutes a violation of the law where you live. It will also let you know the possible penalties involved. You can look up the laws for your state here. \n If you’ve been arrested for a DUI, the police will most likely let you know some of the details of your arrest, such as your BAC level. If they don’t tell you immediately, you should have access to this information within a few days. Once you have this available, compare it to what you’ve found in your state’s DUI law, to get a better idea of what you're facing. Knowing this may also influence your decision as to whether or not you want to retain an attorney. \n If a police officer stops you, and believes you may be under the influence, he or she will normally administer tests at the scene of the stop. Try to recall as much about this as you can. The typical tests are: \n Nystagmus test. You’ll be asked to shift your eye gaze from one side to another while the officer shines a light in your eyes. \n Walk and Turn (WAT) test. The officer will ask you to walk heel-to-toe on a line, while giving you other instructions. \n One Leg Stand (OLS) test. You’ll have to stand on one leg for 30 seconds, so the officer can assess balance and coordination. \n If a police officer believes you’re driving under the influence, in all likelihood he or she will want you to take a chemical test. This is usually a breath test, but also could involve a urine or blood sample, depending on the circumstances. All states have laws that require you to take the chemical test (“implied consent” laws). As with the balance tests, try to remember as much as possible., As soon as you can, make written notes of everything the officer may have told you, and any responses you gave, from the time you were stopped until you were released. This includes how well you believe you did on the balance tests, and what you saw or heard during the chemical test. If the officer said or did anything to imply that you may have been stopped for something other than suspected DUI (such as race or gender), the evidence collected may not be admissible in court. This is also true if the officer didn’t read you your rights after you were arrested., Some attorneys advise against taking any of the field sobriety or chemical tests if you think you'll fail. Depending on your state, you may not be obligated to take the field tests or preliminary breath test at the scene of the stop. But be aware of the following: \n If you don't take the formal chemical test at the police station or hospital, this could lead to a legal inference that you're guilty, which can be used against you in court. \n There are separate penalties for refusing the formal chemical test, such as loss of driving privileges, fines and possibly jail. \n You could end up with two convictions: DUI and refusal to take the test., If you have been arrested for DUI, you might want to consider hiring an attorney or having an attorney appointed for you. A criminal defense attorney can help you challenge your stop and arrest and will help you craft and make logical legal arguments. \n If you can afford a criminal defense attorney, hire one who concentrates on DUI defense. There are plenty of DUI attorneys out there so look for one with excellent communication skills, a good record of success, and great ethics. In general, a DUI defense at this stage will cost between $1,000 and $5,000. For more information on hiring a criminal defense attorney, look here. \n If you can't afford an attorney but you still want one, the law requires that you be appointed a public defender. If you have not had a court appearance yet, invoke your right to counsel by telling any law enforcement official that you would like an attorney and that you cannot afford one. If you have already had a court appearance, ask the judge to have an attorney appointed for you. \n In order to stop a driver, an officer must have “probable cause”, such as erratic driving, for example. If probable cause didn’t exist, the stop could be declared illegal, and the evidence against you may be inadmissible in court.You should also note that some states have outlawed DUI roadblocks or checkpoints. So if this was the reason for your stop, check to see if it's permitted in your state., The officer will need a basis for his or her suspicion that you were under the influence. Usually these are facts such as an odor of an alcoholic beverage, slurred speech, and/or watery or bloodshot eyes. It might help your case if you were able to prove that none of these tell-tale signs existed, or that if they did, there were other, reasonable explanations for them. (Such as using mouthwash or having allergies.), An officer can establish probable cause for the administration of a chemical test, or even an arrest, if you fail the field sobriety tests. It can help your case if you can show that the tests weren’t valid field sobriety tests, or that the results were inaccurate. For example, perhaps you failed the Walk-and-Turn test because of a leg injury., If you can prove that any of the chemical tests were improperly administered, or that the results were compromised, you may be able to exclude the results from a trial.The primary basis for challenging chemical tests (i.e., blood or breath tests) relates to what is called the "blood alcohol curve." The blood alcohol curve helps determine what your blood alcohol content is at any given time.To challenge a chemical test, you will generally argue that because of the science behind this curve, your blood alcohol content was lower at the time of the arrest than at the time of your test. You would argue that, at the time of your arrest, your blood alcohol content was below the legal limit but rose above the legal limit while you were being arrested and processed. For more information about the blood alcohol curve look here. \n If you have been arrested for DUI and you are going to trial, you might want to consider hiring an attorney or having an attorney appointed for you. A criminal defense attorney can help you challenge your stop and arrest and will help you craft and make logical legal arguments at trial. \n If you can afford a criminal defense attorney, hire one who concentrates on DUI defense. There are plenty of DUI attorneys out there so look for one with excellent communication skills, a good record of success, and great ethics. In general, a DUI defense at this stage will cost between $5,000 and $10,000. Lawyers are usually paid on an hourly basis so your costs may be more or less depending on how much work needs to be done. For more information on hiring a criminal defense attorney, look here. \n If you can't afford an attorney but you still want one, the law requires that you be appointed a public defender. If you have not had a court appearance yet, invoke your right to counsel by telling any law enforcement official that you would like an attorney and that you cannot afford one. If you have already had a court appearance, ask the judge to have an attorney appointed for you. \n If you’ve retained a lawyer, he or she will guide you as to what to expect, and how you should act. If you’re representing yourself, consider going to the courtroom where your trial will be held—before your actual trial date. Go inside when a trial is in progress, and pay attention to how the participants conduct themselves. Even though you may not be a lawyer, and even though a judge may give you a little leeway because of this fact, he or she will expect you to obey court rules and regulations., Make sure you have all your witnesses available for your trial date. If an important witness won’t be able to make it, ask the court if you can postpone your case. If you have a lawyer, he or she will review your testimony and your evidence with you in advance. Whether you’re represented by an attorney or not, have your evidence in order, including all documentation and photos you plan to use. You don’t want your case to fall apart because you left a crucial piece of evidence on the dining room table. \n If the prosecutor in your case is willing, consider a plea agreement. In this situation, you’ll plead guilty to an offense other than DUI. For example, the prosecutor may dismiss the DUI charge if you enter a plea of guilty to reckless driving. The benefit is that you avoid a trial, and you don’t have a DUI on your record. There’s no guarantee, however, that a prosecutor will go along with a plea bargain request., If you don’t have an attorney, introduce your evidence, and make your legal arguments, as professionally as possible. If you’ve retained an attorney, listen to his or her advice at all phases of the trial. Whether with an attorney or without one, always conduct yourself properly. Be courteous to the judge, the prosecutor, and any witnesses. The last thing you want to do is alienate a judge or jury by behaving badly. , If you’ve pleaded guilty to DUI, or were found guilty after a trial, the judge may order you to take certain actions, including participating in alcohol rehabilitation or education programs. This is in addition to the penalties imposed. Following through on these orders is required, and failing to do that could lead to more penalties, including not having your driving privileges reinstated, or even jail., If you have a DUI, at some point down the road you may be able to have that conviction removed (expunged) from your criminal record. Not every state allows a DUI conviction to be expunged, and even if it’s removed from any criminal record, it might still remain on your driving history. It’s probably best to consult an attorney to determine if you’re eligible to have your DUI conviction expunged.
 Some aesthetic changes will clash against each other. Even worse, you can run out of space to fit all of the pieces on your car. Run all of the ideas past a car expert before making any financial commitments to them.\n If all you're looking for is a better look, you might find a paint job does everything you want it to. Cars can be painted with specialized spray paint in your garage. Due to the value of your vehicle, it's very important to be slow and consistent with your paint. \n If you're painting the car from home, don't forget to give your car a primer coat beforehand.Car modification garages can offer more intense paint jobs with graphics like flames. These are very stylized, but make sure your car model is worthy of the flair before you commit to something so flashy. Graphic flames on a Toyota Camry won't get you the sort of attention you're looking for. \n Tinted windows add fast class to a vehicle. The mystery factor and privacy of tinted windows can make even an average car look posh by comparison. \n By replacing factory parts, you may void your vehicle's warranty. Check with the manufacturer before proceeding. \n Changing them for a snazzier design is relatively inexpensive by car mod standards. The subtle difference it makes to your vehicle's appearance won't go unnoticed by those who know where to look. \n Make sure your taillight modifications are road-friendly. Although you can change your car's look by replacing the lights on it, you still want to make sure they comply with road regulations. \n While a lot of car modification focuses on the outside presentation, you can revamp your experience on the vehicle by changing the seating. Most stock car seating is cloth-upholstered. For a fashionable touch, replacing this with leather seats is very luxurious. \n If you go with leather seating, make sure you take care to maintain it as leather demands. \n This is because car modders tend to have preferences for certain models over others, and more popular models will have a greater number of readymade options. Even a broken down beater can be souped up into something special if you have the money for it. If it's your first time pimping out a car however, you can make it easier on yourself by picking a mod-friendly vehicle to start with. \n Look online for some examples of your car model being modded. Some car models will come up with lots of results, while others will draw a blank. The number of results will probably give you an idea whether your car is seen as mod-friendly or not. \n This can be done at a car modification garage. Even a slight drop can have a big effect on the look of your vehicle. \n On the other hand, you can boost your suspension up for a more rugged look. This option is popular on trucks and SUVs. \n There is a safety concern involved in lowering your car's suspension. Although it may look cool, you'll be sacrificing some of your car's handling in the process. Keep this in mind if you are considering lowering suspension. A faster-looking car doesn't necessarily mean a better one. \n Spoilers are meant to give your car the visual impression that it's fast enough to need some aerodynamic support. Of course, for all except the fastest race cars, spoilers are just for show.Even so, many gearheads find the look of a spoiler very appealing on a car. Depending on how common the add-on is to your model, your mechanic specialist may be able to direct you to a spoiler specially suited to the car you want modded. \n A stereo system doesn't change your car's appearance in any significant way, but a new subwoofer will be felt. If you have the money to spend upgrading your car, giving your stereo a facelift will give your vehicle the soundtrack to boot. Best of all, you can be as cheap or expensive as you'd like with reinventing your sound system. A new pair of front speakers might only set you back $50, while a full-blown stereo system can cost you thousands of dollars. \n Bass isn't everything to a stereo system. A rich sound will give you more listening enjoyment than a rig with all its power on the bass end of the spectrum. \n Don't be inconsiderate by blasting your subwoofer in crowded areas. \n Hydraulics are a theatrical twist on your car. With hydraulics, you can boost your car's suspension and make it "dance". Hydraulics are a big part of car modder culture, and are preferred on vehicles with low suspension, called low-riders. If you want a playful trick to your car, take it to a garage and get this specialized suspension control installed. \n Hydraulic suspension is pricey, and many outside the car modding community associate it with gang culture. \n If you're in with a car modding community, you might try joining a car hydraulics "dance competition". \n If you are interested in increasing the functionality of your vehicle, getting a higher-quality brand of tire for your vehicle can change your experience of driving it. This is an important trick whether you're a car modding or a "casual" car owner. \n Keep your area's weather in mind when you pick out tires. Some tires are specially designed to function in rain or snow. \n Generally speaking, the bigger your wheels are, the less responsive they'll be when you're driving.Try to strike a balance between form and function with your tires. \n These computers determine how much fuel is injected into the engine at different RPMs. If you want to get an added boost (and fuel economy) from your car, you can buy an input panel for your ECU and have it installed in your car. Although it's only recommended you change an ECU's default settings if you know what you're doing, you can squeeze some extra power out of your car just by improving the efficiency of parts you already have. \n By cutting out fuel at precise times, you can make your car "backfire", shooting a burst of flame out the exhaust when you rev it. This is not recommended for street vehicles however, and should only be approached if you know what you're doing. \n Having you exhaust and muffler replaced with something more sleek can help improve the vehicle's efficiency. Some car modders also enjoy playing around with the sound a car makes. Removing a muffler will make your car sound considerably louder. While this might make the car sound faster, it's also inconsiderate to other people using the road. \n However, these erode with time. Replacing them with durable polyurethane may be a largely invisible improvement to your vehicle, but it can do wonders for a vehicle's handling if you've been driving it a while. \n Car modifications can affect your insurance premiums. It's best to look into the ways each modification may affect your insurance before committing to them. Talk to your insurance company if you're unclear., All the same you'll want to keep legality in mind while modding your car to make sure it's not taken away from you once you're on the road. \n Legality will depend on the specific country you're living in. As a general rule, if your car looks more like it's designed for a racetrack, there's probably something about it that conflicts with regulation. \n At the end of the day, you should make sure you're keeping your car safe and useable. Even if something may look cool, nothing is worth putting your life and others in danger. \n Most tasteful mods will be received positively, while more bombastic changes might be seen as a joke by other street users. Make a point of avoiding inconsiderate mods. Removing your car's muffler vastly increases the noise pollution your car will create, and anything that creates excess smoke should be rightly avoided. \n 
 \n The larger the bag the better, because it'll leave more of the map visible through the bag's surface. You'll be able to read the topo map without taking it out of the bag, which protects it from wet conditions and also provides some protection against abrasion. \n Gallon-sized bags are ideal.\n \n Peek at where the fold sits before you run your thumb lightly along the crease. You can resituate the fold somewhat, if necessary, to avoid running the crease along any critical features you expect to use for navigation. \n Don't overdo the crease; the more you crease the paper at the fold, the faster the paper will break down and tear or become harder to read. \n \n If you struggle with using the plastic bag as a guide for folding, cut a piece of cardboard to about the same size as the plastic bag and use the cardboard as a guide instead. \n The folded layer in the middle should be a half-inch shorter than the length of the bag (or cardboard guide). This ensures that the map will fit easily into the bag once it's folded. \n Once the entire map is accordion-folded lengthwise, repeat the accordion-fold process widthwise until the topo map folds down into a square that fits inside the plastic bag. \n 
\n Cut with extra care around the antlers––they're tricky. \n Crease well. \n Fold it up, creasing well. Release the tab and put it back into its original position. \n Set the antlers aside. \n Fold it against the reindeer's head, creasing well. Release the tab and put it back into its original position. \n Return the right side to its original position. \n Return the head to its original position \n Crease well. \n Return the tab to its original position. Fold up the left tab, crease and return to its original position. \n Apply a small amount of glue to each tab at the bottom. \n Using the guides on the card, align the antlers and press down into position allowing the glue to dry completely. The antlers should lay perfectly flat on the card. \n Using the guides on the card, align the body and press down into position allowing the glue to dry (be patient). \n If the pieces need a little assistance folding back into the card, use your fingers to help. \n Choose colors that reflect the season. Done. The card is now ready to send. \n 
 Check both your inside and outside mirrors to make sure you can see properly.\n \n If you don't hear any engine noise, this is because the car is running on electricity only. \n You can use your rear-windshield wiper to clear off any items that may be impeding your view. You can also manually clear off any precipitation that may be impeding your view. You may leave the wiper on, if you feel you need it to continue your journey. \n Look specifically for the gas amount and temperature controls. Although the gas will tend to not be so much of a factor, the car does run for a short time on gas. Temperature ranges are read just like any other car. \n The car will give you a readout in digital form. Despite popular demand of what most cars give you, Toyota thought they'd make it easier on their customers to give them a more-enjoyable and more easily-read readout. \n The turn signal is on the left stalk in the car.). \n If it's already disengaged, skip this step. This is done by pushing in the pedal furthest to the left which is marked "Push On Off". \n Recognize that there is no Park position on the gearshift itself. Instead, you can use the Neutral (N) position. \n Make sure the car is in the drive position and not in the overdrive mode. Look at the joystick-like shifter to the right of the button that powers the car to an on position. \n When the car is in P mode, your dashboard will light up the P mode light (it will place a square around the letter P to the left of the digital speedometer. This selector is positioned in the middle right area of the gear selection knob where there is a large filled dot. This mode is much similar to the Park position on a Automatic Transmission car. \n Shift into R mode when you need to reverse the car. However, shifting into R mode will trigger to turn on the rear camera on the vehicle. If you enable the feature by pressing the button, R mode will be the first mode you'll need to shift into to begin a ParkAssist maneuver with your Prius. R mode runs the same way as Reverse does in an another automatic transmission car. This mode is positioned at the top left of the shift column from the shift lever. \n Use the N mode when you need to use the Neutral gear. Shifting into this gear on a flat slope will cause your car not to move anyplace, however on a downward slope the car will start to roll forward without any gas applied. N mode is straight across from P and must be shifted into each and every time to get it out of park and into a drivable gear. \n Use the D mode when you want to drive the vehicle. D mode operates the same way shifting an automatic into Drive does. D mode is in the bottom left corner of the shifting column. \n Use B mode occasionally. The B mode (shown on the gear lever) can also be used to make the car move forwards. When B mode is activated, engine braking is much more pronounced. It can be found immediately under P mode, and you shouldn't need to shift it into any other gear on the left to operate this mode. \n
 The Constitution is the 'fulfillment of the promise' for the people. The founders meant The Constitution, and its Twin - The Declaration (The Promise)to be read by "We the People" from age 7-8 intermittently through the voting years of adulthood. \n \n A. \n B. \n \n A. \n B. \n \n A. \n B. \n END of "Hamilton's Legislative Test"; but Not the end of Amendment X\n \n A. \n B. \n"., Resources abound, but with Constitutional issues, the original documents are the best resource. Much of modern resources can be lopsided due to bias, revisionist history, or other factors common in Political definitions., is Not in Compliance with the Constitution:, Party affiliation is Not Involved. Be clear about how you address the issue you identified. He/she may not answer. That moves the representative off your support list. Look for allies and perform the grassroots. Keep after your legislative members with the consequences of "Silence"! Our Constitution (and Declaration) does not know party. "All governments naturally tend towards tyranny because they are easy prey for men to exploit for money and power. One of the best to control government is with written documents that are universally accepted."
 He is the first in game character you meet on the game; he will guide you through the tutorial. You start off the game with a hut and the town hall, which will be explained later.\n Once you start the game, you are in the Stone age, there are many ages/eras in the game, from this one to the Bronze age and so on. You now need to open up the building menu by clicking on the hand holding a hammer symbol at the bottom of the screen then click on the hut and place it in the required space. \n Click on it to see your next quest. \n Click to build the hunter, you can place it anywhere, as long as it is connected to road. \n You need to click on the button with the glass science flasks on it and open up the tech tree. This is where you can research technologies to advance in the game, click on 'stilt houses' and use your forge points to research it. You start with 10 forge points; they gradually replenish over time. \n Then click 'back to city'. Your town hall will now change because you have entered a new age! This will happen every time you do, Ragu's appearance will also change but not every time you enter a new age., Now that you are comfortable in the Bronze age, it is time to build 2 new houses to increase your population. Your population is shown at the top of the screen, with a symbol of 2 people in the bar next to the face that shows happiness. Build the 2 houses anywhere that is connected by road, of course then go on to see your next quest! \n As said earlier, the face at the top of the screen shows this, if it is smiling, it means that your people are happy, build decorations to increase happiness. \n To build decorations, open the building menu again and click on the tree in a pot symbol, that is where all the decorations. Build one, decorations don't need road so they can be put anywhere! This will increase your happiness and make your people happy! \n You get 2 spear fighters, military units as a reward from the previous quest and this is when they can be put into good hands! You need to click the button with a compass like symbol on it, this will open up the continent map. This is where you and your troops can go into battle and conquer the world! \n Click on attack and it will appear with the preparations menu, click attack again and it will go into battle! \n Click on the space to move your troop there; there are several terrain types on the battlefield. Different ones give you different boosts for your troops; you can't go over water until later in the game so don't click on a water area. \n This is a turn-taking game, once you move your first unit, the opponent will move one of his units. Next, move your unit close to the enemy in order to attack it! \n Now you are free from the main tutorial but it is not over yet! \n Supply production buildings like the hunter have 6 products you can make them produce, they range from 5 minute production to 1 day production times, click on the 5 minute one to start you off. Your town hall produces coins once every day anyway., Once done, click on 'back to city' and build one, like before it needs to be connected to road. The pottery will be in on the menu where the hunter is. Once it is built, put it into production as well, you don't have to but it is always helpful. \n Continue to do Ragu's quests to advance in the game, later in the game, new faces will appear! They are mostly side quests, you don't need to do these but it is always good to help out your friends!
 By being surrounded by this information all the time, they will gradually begin to remember this information subconsciously, meaning that the facts will be second hand. This will make learning even more new information much easier., There are plastic ones available that will float in the bathtub, allowing that fun sense of learning to go beyond the class room and encourage them to think for themselves - encourage them to play with those. \n Remember, the concept of counting is more important than learning to identify shapes of numeric figures - that will be something that comes after counting has become normal in every day life. The recognition of numeric figures should come in natural, gradual way, through activities. Do not force the information too much, especially if the child is struggling with the information or finding it overwhelming. Allow them time to think and explain things in a clear, concise manner which is simple but not immensely detailed. Mastering the basics is your chief aim here before moving on to further elements. \n This should hopefully provide initiative for the child to demonstrate their counting skills whilst playing and without you necessarily needing to ask them. \n Oh, Hey! Another one; and guess what, that's a total of two!" \n This will subtly remind them of what they have been learning, again encouraging them to think about it beyond the class room to incorporate it into every day life. \n That will soon clear up as their vocabulary and mathematical skills develop with age and time. \n 1 can of food and 1 more can equals two cans of food. Right? \n "Can I get a Yeah!" \n Support them in all they do, to define a clear sense of right and wrong. \n Use technical words like "equals, sum, total, solution, objects," etc. They will get the hang of it when you keep using them from day to day. Tell them abstract concept of measurement, like taller than, shorter than, lower than, higher than, smaller than, larger than through these activities. If you feel they are beginning to become used to or accustomed to a word, begin to throw in new words to their vocabulary to make things more interesting and challenging. \n "Let's 'subtract.' What is 3 bottles of milk 'minus' 1 bottle?" (That equals two bottles) "Right!" \n Explain that when they spend their money then that is "subtracting" from what they handed to the cashier, and the answer or "solution" is what they get back as change... \n That would be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Doing that motivates a new idea and leads to learning to multiply. \n Repeatedly adding 2 is what multiplying by two is based upon. It's a short cut for repeated addition of the same number: \n 2, 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 2 = 6, 6 + 2 = 8, 8 + 2 = 10, two is in 10 5 times. So then say, "2 multiplied by 5 is equal to 10," then also say "5 times 2 equals 10"... \n Repeatedly subtracting 2 is what dividing by two is based upon. \n 10 - 2 = 8, 8 - 2 = 6, 6 - 2 = 4, 4 - 2 = 2, 2-2 = 0, two is in 10 5 times. So then 10 divided by 2 is 5. Use multiplying to check division. \n 10 divided by 5 = 2 \n "Check": 2 times 5 is 10. \n at a glance over time.\n Talk about 1/2 of a candy, half of a drink, etc. \n Ask, "Is this half?" Explain that it's only half if it is split into 2 equal parts, numbers or amounts. \n Ask, "Can I have the big half?"; then ask "Why that is a silly question?" \n Explain that "half" really means splitting something into parts that are "exactly the same" and so either half should be equal: the same... \n So explain that 1 out of 2 possible or 2 out of 4 of the same kind of things is another way to say "one half", so 2 is half of 4 (of of the 4 items or half of the 4 minutes of "time"). \n Avoid gambling when flipping coins or playing dominoes: you don't want to promote bad habits or addiction. They learn about that soon enough. \n 
\n At first, it was thought one might save a lot of time if one had read this article - "Create a Pink Love Note of Spheres in Form of a Heart", because there is a section that was introduced with that article that gets used again here. But, as it turns out, there have been changes in the interim. \n The formulas for A1 and A2 are the same. Adjuster = 1. \n Enter -61 for TURNS into cell B2. \n The result in cell B5 now shows -81,152 and the formula is "=IF(TURNS>0,VLOOKUP(TURNS,TURNS_LOOKUP,2),VLOOKUP(TURNS, TURNS_LOOKUP_NEG,2))" which is the same I believe. \n Enter 26 for S's Count into cell C1. (although 28 will appear.) \n The result in cell C2 = 2230 for Designer and the formula has not changed from "=VLOOKUP(S_COUNT,SPHEROIDS_COUNT_LOOKER,2)" \n The formula for Var, cell C3, has been overwritten with the value 25. \n The formula for Cc is unchanged and the result is -.03141593 \n db is unchanged at 4.5 \n GMSL and GMLL are unchanged. \n The formula for top is unchanged at "=ROUND((-B4*PI())+(Adj),0)" and the result is 886771. \n AAA is unchanged at 1.00244189810508 \n Enter 27.5 for Divisor into cell E3. \n Enter Y into YN in cell E4. \n The formula for Factor is unchanged at "=IF(E4="Y",IF(ODD(S_COUNT)=S_COUNT,-S_COUNT*0.01,S_COUNT*0.01),-0.25)" and the result  is +.26 \n Enter 0 for Power into cell F2. \n Cells H1 and J1 are unchanged at .92 and .96 respectively and the formulas for Sync1 and Sync2 are the same. \n \n B7'S formula has not changed from "=IF(EVEN(S_COUNT)=S_COUNT,ROUND((-B4*PI())+(Adj),0),TOP)" \n B8:B1447's formulas have not changed from "=((B7+(-TOP*2)/(AdjRows)))*$B$1" \n C7's formula has not changed from "=ROUND(-EXP((PI()^2)+(Cc*-(db))),0)+Designer" \n Edit Go To cell range D7:D1447 and with D7 active, enter the formula w/o quotes, "=X7/Divisor+COS((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)" and Edit Fill Down. \n Edit Go To cell range E7:E1447 and with E7 active, enter the formula w/o quotes, "=Y7/Divisor+SIN((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)" and Edit Fill Down. \n Cell range F7:F1447's formulae remain the same as "=IF(A7=0,F6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*COS(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+D7)))" \n Cell range G7:G1447's formulae remain the same as "=IF(A7=0,G6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*SIN(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+E7)))" \n Cell range H7:H1447's formulae remain the same as "=F7*GMLL*Sync1" \n Cell range I7:I1447's formulae remain the same as "=G7*GMLL*Sync1" \n Cell range J7:J1447's formulae remain the same as "=F7*GMSL*Sync2" \n Cell range K7:K1447's formulae remain the same as "=G7*GMSL*Sync2" \n The worksheet does not contain a Defined Variable Name of TT either. No need for you to enter it. Probably part of some approach to a problem that was solved in another way., TURNS_LOOKUP is now in cells $M$2:$N$1441. TURNS_LOOKUP_NEG is in cells $O$2:$P$1442 and runs in column O from -1440 to 0 and in column P from -104192 to 412 (an increment of 72). SPHEROIDS_COUNT_LOOKER is in cells $R$2:$S$1441 and increments by 251175.5 from a base value of -6,363,636 in column S, and from 0 to 1 in cells R2:R25 and then increments by 1 to  a value of 1416 in cell R1446 and then 10,000 in cell R1447., Select cell AA7 and input the value 28.6470945405378. In cell W1, enter "Pool Ball Process:" . In cell V2, enter the note "1) Figure out H, K's per Grid Analysis or previous values;", In cell V3, enter the note "2) Figure out if FFF variable changes -- it adjusts rows up-Y a little -- best ball fit;". In cell V4, enter the note "3) Fill down formulas for X, Y and Radius -- R must = .50000!!" and in cell X5 enter the title "POOL BALL X,Y Determinators:" and Format Cell Font Bold. Edit Go To cell range X7:X1446 and with X7 active enter the formula "=(COS(ROW()-7)*PI()/180*FFF)+V7". Edit Go To cell range Y7:Y1446 and with Y7 active enter the formula "=(COS(ROW()-7)*PI()/180*FFF)+W7". Then read the rest of this section and realize there may be changes in the interim which need updating, but that basically you have now the same info., Enter into cell AA7 28.6470945405378 and Insert Name Define name FFF to cell $AA$7. Enter Per Goal Seeking in cell AA8 and select cell range AA7:AA8 and Format Cells Border Black bold Outline. Enter the notes "Be careful of formulas below" in cell range AA10:AA12.

 To get the most out of Google Photos features, such as automatic (and unlimited!) photo backups, install the app from your device’s app store.\n \n If you see an UPDATE button, Google Photos is installed but out of date. Tap UPDATE to get the latest version of the app. \n This makes it so your photos automatically upload to Google Photos. \n Otherwise, your phone will automatically back up your photos when you’re not on Wi-Fi. This can be costly!, You’ll have unlimited space for uploads. Photos and videos will upload at a maximum of 1080p full HD resolution and 16 megapixels. \n Original: You’ll be able to upload higher quality photos and videos, but they’ll count against your Google quota (no matter their size). Choose this option if you’re a professional photographer who already pays for extra space in the Google cloud. \n When it’s complete, you’ll arrive at the Photos screen. \n If you also store photos on a macOS or Windows computer, you’ll want to install Google Photos Backup so they automatically back up to the cloud. \n Follow your web browser’s prompts to save the installer to your computer. \n This is different depending on your computer.Mac: Drag the Google Photos icon to the Applications icon. Then, double-click “Google Photos Backup.” If prompted, click Open to confirm. \n Windows: Double-click the installer in your Downloads folder. \n Once the sign-in is complete, you’ll see the “Choose Backup Sources” screen. \n Any photos stored in one of these folders will be automatically backed up to Google Photos. \n If you don’t see a folder you want to back up, click Add folder and select the correct folder. \n You’ll have unlimited space for uploads. Photos and videos will upload at a maximum of 1080p full HD resolution and 16 megapixels. \n Original: You’ll be able to upload higher quality photos and videos, but they’ll count against your Google quota (no matter their size). Choose this option if you’re a professional photographer who already pays for extra space in the Google cloud. \n A confirmation popup will appear, letting you know that your backup has begun. \n This will close the window. \n It’s a rainbow pinwheel icon located at the top right (macOS) or bottom right (Windows) area of the screen (near the clock). A brief menu will appear. \n If you don’t see the icon on your Windows system, click the up-arrow next to the clock to show your hidden icons. \n All of your backed up photos appear here. \n When you launch the app, you’ll see a list of your photos you’ve added. \n The photos appear in the order in which they were uploaded, with the newest photos appearing first. \n You can also navigate your photos at http://photos.google.com. \n While you’re viewing a photo in this mode, you can: \n Pinch to zoom in and out. \n Swipe left or right to view the next photo in that direction. \n Tap the Share icon to share the photo with other apps. \n Tap the Pencil icon to edit the photo. \n Tap the “i” icon to view photo details, such as the date it was taken and the size of the file. \n Tap the trash icon to delete the photo. \n This will open the Search panel. \n Google Photos has sorted your uploaded photos into those categories to make it easy for you to find what you’re looking for.People: Google tries to group similar faces in your photos. See Label Faces in Google for tips on making the most out of this feature. \n Places: Tap a location to view all photos taken there. This feature only works with photos that were taken with location data turned on. \n Things: These are sub-categories of types of photos you may be looking for, such as Selfies, Cats, Screenshots, Sunsets, etc. \n Try searching for something you know is in your uploaded photos, such as “dogs” or “selfies.” If there are photos that match what you typed, they’ll appear in the search results. \n Google Photos has built-in tools that can help improve the quality of your photos. You can access these tools in the mobile app or at http://photos.google.com. \n If the first icon on the second line of icons is blue, you’re already in this mode. Otherwise, tap that first icon (three broken horizontal lines). Here’s what you can do in this mode: \n Tap “Auto” to have Google Photos automatically correct the photo’s basic elements, such as lighting and color. \n Tap “Light” to access the brightness slider. Move it to the right to make the photo lighter, and to the left to darken. \n Tap “Color” to control the photo’s color saturation. Move the slider to the right to increase saturation, and left to decrease. \n Tap “Pop” to add additional vibrance to colors and shadows. \n Tap “Vignette” to surround the photo with darkened edges. \n Tap the X to cancel your changes or tap the check mark to save them. \n This is the second icon in the bottom row (a square with a landscape inside). \n Tap any filter to see a preview. \n Move the slider on the screen to increase or decrease the strength of the filter. \n Tap the X to cancel your changes or tap the check mark to save them. \n This is the third (last) icon on the bottom row in Editing mode. This tool helps you crop out just the part of the photo you want to keep. \n Drag the corners inward until you’ve selected just the area of the photo you want to keep. \n Tap the checkmark to save the cropped version of the photo. \n Tap the X to cancel your changes. \n Automatic backups aren’t the only way to get your photos into Google Photos—you can also upload individual photos (such as photos you’ve downloaded from the internet) to Google Photos manually. \n \n If you’re not already signed in to Google Photos, sign in when prompted. \n \n To select more than one photo at a time, hold down ⌘ Cmd (macOS) or Ctrl (Windows) as you click each file. \n Your photos will now upload to your Google Photos account. \n You can use the Google Photos Assistant to organize your photos, create collages, and other creative projects., This is at the top right corner of the mobile app (you won’t see it on the website, but that’s okay). \n This is a great way to organize your photos by criteria that you choose. \n Click or tap the photos you want to add to the album. \n Click “Create.” \n Type a name for your album. \n Click or tap the check mark at the top of the screen to save your album. \n See Organize Photos in Google Photos for more tips on using albums to keep your photos organized. \n \n Click or tap up to 50 photos to appear in your animation. \n Click or tap “Create” to view your animation. \n \n Click or tap up to 9 photos for your collage. \n Click “Create” to view your collage. \n Your photos are private unless you decide to share them with others. With Google Photos, you can share content with others over email, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, and many other apps.Your sharing options will depend on your device and operating system. \n \n To select more than one photo in the mobile app, tap the ⁝ icon and choose “Select,” then tap your desired photos. \n To select more than one photo on http://photos.google.com, hover the mouse over each thumbnail until you see a circle appear at its top left corner. Click that circle, and then click the circles in other photos you want to send. \n If you’re using iOS or macOS, it’s a square with an arrow. On an Android, it’s an angle bracket with dotted ends. \n The options will be different depending on your device.Choose “Get link” to create a URL to give to your desired recipient on any platform. \n Enter an email address to email a link to the recipient. \n Enter a phone number to send a text message with a link to the photo. \n Choose a social media app to share the photo with users of that app. The image or link will open in the app. \n Once your photos are backed up to Google Photos, you don’t need to keep them on your phone or tablet. The safest way to reclaim your disk space is to use the “Free Up Space” feature in the Google Photos app., If you see thumbnails that have a crossed-out cloud icon, those photos are not backed up. Make sure your photos are backed up before attempting this method. \n If your photos are only set to back up on Wi-Fi, make sure your Wi-Fi connection is working properly. \n \n Photos in these folders still take up space on your device until they expire. That’s 60 days for Android, and 30 days for iOS. \n If you don’t want to wait, continue with this method to learn how to permanently remove deleted photos. \n \n In Google Photos, tap the ☰ icon and select “Trash.” \n Tap the ⁝ menu and select “Empty Trash.” \n \n Return to the home screen. \n Tap the Photos app (the one that came with your phone). \n Tap “Albums” and select “Recently Deleted.” \n Tap “Select” at the top right corner. \n Tap “Delete All.” \n 
\n As power consuming as hard drives are, CD and DVD drives use more power than hard drives. Even having one in the drive can be power consuming. They spin, taking power, even when they are not actively being used. Wherever possible, try to run on virtual drives. \n Clean your battery's metal contacts every couple of months with a cloth moistened with rubbing alcohol. This keeps the transfer of power from your battery more efficient. \n Usually, there is a switch, but sometimes you have to do it in the WiFi config. \n Once charged, you should at least use the battery at least once every two weeks. \n Although placing a laptop in standby mode saves some power and you can instantly resume where you left off, it doesn't save anywhere as much power as the hibernate function does. Hibernating a laptop will actually save more power as it will completely shut down itself. \n The faster your hard drive does its work the less demand you are going to put on the hard drive and your battery. Make your hard drive as efficient as possible by defragging it regularly. \n All laptops come with the option to lower brightness. Some even come with ways to modify CPU and cooling performance. \n All these add load to the CPU and cut down battery life. Shut down everything that isn't crucial when you're on battery. \n USB devices & WiFi drain down your laptop battery. Remove or shut them down when not in use. \n This will allow you to process more with the memory your laptop has, rather than relying on virtual memory. Virtual memory results in hard drive use, and is much less power efficient. \n Clean out your air vents with a cloth or keyboard cleaner. \n Do one thing at a time when you're on battery, rather than working on a spreadsheet, letting your email client run in the background, and listening to music at the same time, which puts unnecessary overhead on your computer's CPU \n Laptops are getting more and more efficient in nature to the point where some manufacturers are talking about batteries lasting all day long. Picking up a newer more efficient laptop to replace an aging one is usually a quick fix. \n Exceptions to the rule are Li-Ion batteries (which most laptops have) which do not suffer from the memory effect. \n Microsoft Word and Excel autosave functions are great, but because they keep saving at regular intervals, which work your hard drive harder than it may have to. If you plan to do this, you may want to turn it back on as the battery runs low. While it saves battery life in the beginning, you will want to make sure your work is saved when your battery dies. \n Video cards use as much power today as hard disks. \n 
 The easiest way to do this is to type internet speed into Google and then click the RUN SPEED TEST button near the top of the search results. This will give you an estimate of your computer's current download speed. \n If you see that your download speed is significantly faster than files are actually downloading, the problem most likely isn't with your Internet. \n If your download speed is much slower than your Internet package and router allow for, you need to minimize the number of devices connected to the Internet.\n The more devices you have on your network, the slower your Internet will be. If you can disable consoles, phones, televisions, tablets, and alternate computers, your own computer's downloads will be faster., When you're downloading a big (or a small) file, it helps to turn off apps that are taking up your bandwidth. \n For example, you'd close BitTorrent if it was running in the background while you attempted to download a Windows update. \n Netflix, Hulu, and even YouTube can be a serious drain on your download speed. Even if it's only by a marginal amount, disabling these services will boost your download speeds. \n You should also close any non-essential browser windows or tabs. \n If your computer isn't using an Ethernet connection, connect it to your router with an Ethernet cable and see if your downloads increase in speed. \n If your downloads do increase in speed, your wireless connection to the router is poor. Try staying closer to the router or purchasing a stronger router. \n If the download speed doesn't increase, the problem is either with the router or your computer. \n You can reset your router's cache by unplugging both the router and the modem, waiting for a minute or so, and then plugging everything back in. \n As noble as it may be to give back to your favorite torrenting community by uploading, doing so while downloading will all but kill your download speeds. Wait to seed until all of your downloads have completed and you're no longer using the Internet (e.g., when you're at work or asleep)., This action disguises what you're downloading so that your ISP doesn't selectively throttle it. (ISPs will throttle if they know a BitTorrent client is doing a lot of downloading.) To do this: \n Click Options in the BitTorrent or uTorrent window. \n Click Preferences. \n Click BitTorrent. \n Click the "Outgoing" drop-down box. \n Select Forced. \n Click Apply, then click OK. \n If your router is more than a couple of years old, it will invariably begin to slow down, and it won't handle downloads as well as a newer one. \n When purchasing a new router, make sure you look at models that support the same download speed as your Internet package (or, ideally, higher download speeds). \n Some Internet connections simply aren't able to handle hefty downloads, such as console or computer game installations. Many ISPs have a "Gamer" package that prioritizes download speed, though you'll likely have to pay significantly more for this package than you would for a standard Internet package., If you've tried everything else and you can't get your download speeds to increase, you'll need to call your ISP and tell them about the problems you're experiencing. \n You may even need to switch your ISP if you live in a remote-enough area. \n Click the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen, or press ⊞ Win., It's in the bottom-left side of the Start window., It's near the top of the Settings page., This option is beneath the "Change your network settings" heading on the Status tab., It will be on the Connections page. This will select it., This button is in the top row of options in the window. Clicking it will open the connection's settings., It's in the window that's in the middle of Wi-Fi Properties. \n You may first need to click the Networking tab at the top of Wi-Fi Properties. \n It's near the bottom of the window., It's near the bottom of the Properties window., Do so in the "Preferred DNS server" field. Reliable DNS servers include the following: \n OpenDNS - Enter 208.67.222.222. \n Google - Enter 8.8.8.8. \n Do so in the "Alternate DNS server" field: \n OpenDNS - Enter 208.67.220.220. \n Google - Enter 8.8.4.4. \n This saves your DNS settings., It's at the bottom of the window., Once your computer finishes booting up, you can test your download speeds; if your network was the reason they were slow, they should be faster now., Click the Apple icon in the top-left corner of the screen., This is near the top of the Apple drop-down menu., It's a globe-shaped icon in the System Preferences window., It should be in the pane on the left side of the window., You'll find this near the middle of the window., It's at the top of the window., This option is below the DNS Servers window., OpenDNS and Google both have reliable, quick DNS servers: \n Google - 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4. \n OpenDNS - 208.67.222.222 or 208.67.220.220 \n If you want to enter a preferred and an alternate server address, type in one address (e.g., 8.8.8.8), type a comma, type a space, and then type the second address (e.g., 8.8.4.4). \n It's on the far-right side of the tabs at the top of the window., This box is near the top of the Hardware page., The "MTU" box is below the "Configure" box., It's below the "MTU" box., It's at the bottom of the page., This button is at the bottom of the page. Your settings will be saved and applied to your current Wi-Fi network., Once your computer finishes booting up, you can test your download speeds; if your network was the reason they were slow, they should be faster now.
 Make sure you're not putting yourself in harm's way by administering CPR to someone unconscious. Is there a fire? Is the person lying on a roadway? Do whatever is necessary to move yourself and the other person to safety. \n If there is anything that could endanger you or the victim, see whether there is something you can do to counteract it. Open a window, turn off the stove, or put out the fire, if possible. \n However, if there is nothing you can do to counteract the danger, move the victim. The best way to move the victim is by placing a blanket or coat underneath their back and dragging it.\n Gently tap his or her shoulder and ask "Are you OK?" in a loud, clear voice. If he or she responds agreement "Yeah" or such, CPR is not required. Instead, undertake basic first aid and take measures to prevent or treat shock, and assess whether you need to contact emergency services. \n If the victim does not respond, continue with the following steps. \n The more people available for this step, the better. However, it can be done alone. Send someone to call for emergency medical services (EMS). \n To contact emergency services, call \n • 911 in North America \n • 000 in Australia \n • 112 by cell phone in the EU (including the UK) \n • 999 in the UK and Hong Kong. \n • 102 in India \n •1122 in Pakistan \n • 111 in New Zealand \n •123 in Egypt \n •120 in China \n Give the dispatcher your location, and notify him or her that you're going to perform CPR. If you're alone, put your phone on speaker mode so your hands are free to start compressions. If you have someone else with you, have him or her stay on the line while you do CPR on the victim. \n Unless you're a trained medical professional, odds are you'll spend too much valuable time looking for a pulse when you should be doing compressions. \n And, make sure that the airway is not blocked. If the mouth is closed, press with your thumb and forefinger on both cheeks at the back of the teeth to help open the mouth and then look inside. Remove any visible obstacle that is in your reach but never push your fingers too far inside. Put your ear close to the victim's nose and mouth, and listen for slight breathing. Watch for rising and falling of the chest.If the victim is coughing or breathing normally, do not perform CPR. \n Make sure he or she is lying as flat as possible - this is to prevent injury while you're doing chest compressions.Tilt their head back by using your palm against their forehead and a push against their chin. \n Don't flex the arms to push, but nearly lock your elbows, and use your upper body strength to push. \n Press down with both hands directly over the breastbone to perform a compression, which helps the heart beat. Chest compressions are more critical for correcting abnormal heart rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, heart rapidly quivering instead of beating). \n You should press down by about 2 inches (5 cm). \n Do the compressions in a relatively fast rhythm. Some agencies recommend doing compressions to the beat of the chorus of "Stayin' Alive," a 1970s disco hit, or at roughly 100 beats per minute. \n Place your hand on the victim's forehead and two fingers on their chin and tilt the head back to open the airway. \n If you suspect a neck injury, pull the jaw forward rather than lifting the chin. If jaw thrust fails to open the airway, do a careful head tilt and chin lift. \n If there are no signs of life, place a breathing barrier (if available) over the victim's mouth. \n The American Heart Association no longer considers rescue breaths necessary for CPR, as the chest compressions are more important. If you are trained in CPR and totally confident, give two rescue breaths after your 30 chest compressions. If you've never done CPR before, or you're trained but rusty, stick with only chest compressions.Keeping the airway open, take the fingers that were on the forehead and pinch the victim's nose closed. Make a seal with your mouth over the victim's mouth and breathe out for about one second. Make sure you breathe slowly, as this will make sure the air goes in the lungs and not the stomach. \n If the breath goes in, you should see the chest slightly rise and also feel it go in. Give a second rescue breath. \n If the breath does not go in, re-position the head and try again. If it does not go in again, the victim may be choking. Do abdominal thrusts (the Heimlich maneuver) to remove the obstruction. \n If you're also doing rescue breaths, keep doing a cycle of 30 chest compressions, and then 2 rescue breaths; repeat the 30 compressions and 2 more breaths. \n You should do CPR for 2 minutes (5 cycles of compressions to breaths) before spend time checking for signs of life. \n If an AED is available in the immediate area, use it as soon as possible to jump-start the victim's heart. Make sure there are no puddles or standing water in the immediate area. \n It should have voice prompts that tell you what to do. \n Remove any metal necklaces or underwire bras. Check for any body piercings, or evidence that the victim has a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (should be indicated by a medical bracelet) to avoid shocking too close to those spots (). \n Make sure the chest is absolutely dry and the victim is not in a puddle. Note that, if the person has a lot of chest hair, you may need to shave it, if possible. Some AED kits come with razors for this purpose. \n Follow the instructions on the AED for placement. Move the pads at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from any metal piercings or implanted devices. \n Make sure no one is touching the person, when you apply the shock. \n If a shock is needed for the patient, the machine will notify you. If you do shock the victim, make sure no one is touching him or her. \n Stick on adhesive electrode pads are intended to be left in place. \n Then position the free hand onto the opposite shoulder, and roll the victim onto the side with the straight leg. The raised knee/bent leg is on top and helps stop the body from rolling over onto the abdomen. The arm with the hand tucked under the edge of the hip is kept from sticking out in the way when rolling the patient onto that side. \n This position keeps saliva (spit) from accumulating in the back of the mouth or throat, and helps the tongue to hang to the side without it falling/flopping into the back of the mouth and obstructing the airway. \n 
 Place it on a table or counter so the refrigerator is completely emptied out. You will want to have empty space so that you can easily assess what items to sort through. \n Although most food will be fine when left out for a short period of time, make sure that such food is not left out more than an hour or so. Food can reach "the danger zone" in a relatively short period of time. \n Having a cooler can make the process a bit safer for food safety, especially during hot summer months. \n If you are cleaning out the refrigerator in cold weather, you may be able to put the items outside while you sort at your leisure.\n If possible, bag securely to prevent leakage or mold distribution. The yearly or quarterly refrigerator clean often alerts us to items we've completely forgotten about. \n Check expiration and "use by" dates. These are indicators that a given item should be cleaned out. \n Throw away items that you are unlikely to use. If no one in the house likes olives, get rid of the jar that has been in the refrigerator since the martini party. \n Empty the bin afterwards to make sure your house doesn't smell of all the food you throw out! \n In order to get the job done quicker, you'll probably want to remove shelving and the like and place it near the kitchen sink, where it will be much easier to clean. \n For a quick clean, you do not necessarily have to take out all shelving. But doing so assures a more in-depth clean. \n Usually shelving comes out in a similar fashion to oven racks, or drawers in a bureau. \n Dish soap will be fine. Most of what you took out of your fridge either won't fit or shouldn't be placed in a dishwasher. Instead, lather up some suds, get a nice brush or sponge to scrub with, and start going at the removable items from your fridge. \n Never wash a cold glass shelf with hot water. The sudden temperature change could shatter the glass. Instead, use cold water or remove the shelf and let it come up to room temperature before washing it. \n For heavy-duty spills and/or stains, don't be afraid to use the power of hot water and ammonia. Dilute a little bit of ammonia in hot water (1:5 ratio should be plenty) and let the item(s) soak before scrubbing. \n Be sure to let the shelving, and drawers dry out completely on a drying rack before inserting back into the refrigerator. \n Attack any big or stubborn stains and hit all the remaining surfaces with a clean cloth or sponge. \n You probably don't want to use a strongly scented soap or cleaner on the inside of the fridge, as food may absorb the smell. Instead, use one of the following natural cleaning solutions: \n 2 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 quart hot water1 part apple cider vinegar to 3 parts hot water \n For really stubborn stains or buildups, try using a dab of white toothpaste. It serves as an abrasive cleanser and it smells mighty fine to boot., If your refrigerator door has shelving space and is regularly used, make sure to hit that area too, either with a chemical cleaner or a gentler one (explanation above). \n With a clean cloth, wipe off any excess water from your removable shelving and place it back in the refrigerator. \n Don’t saturate the seal with undiluted bleach as this may ruin the integrity of the gasket. Pat the gasket dry and then apply lemon oil, mineral oil, or body lotion on the gasket to keep the rubber supple. \n Wipe off any jars, bottles, or tupperware and place them back into the refrigerator. Double-check the expiration dates on any perishable items before placing them back. \n \n Pull the refrigerator forward to expose all sides. To avoid scratching your wood floor or tearing linoleum, use an appliance glide when moving your refrigerator. \n Clean the all exterior surfaces using a towel and all-purpose cleaner. \n If your model has the coils mounted on the back of the unit, skip wiping the back until Part 3. \n For information on your refrigerator's condenser coil location, reference your Use and Care manual. Depending on your refrigerator model, the condenser coils can be located in several places: \n Along the back of the unit, or \n Mounted under the unit and accessed via the rear panel, or \n In the front of the unit and accessed via the toe grill. \n It is important to unplug the refrigerator to prevent electric shock. If your unit is built-in or difficult to pull forward, turn off power via your home’s breaker box. \n Be extremely careful not to puncture the coils. \n After cleaning the coils with a coil brush, use a vacuum with attached brush to clean up the excess dust and dirt on and around the coils. Do not use a cleaning solution on the coils \n The fan circulates are across the coils, which aids in releasing excess heat. If the fan blade is obstructed in anyway, the coils will have a hard time releasing heat. \n Every three months, remove most or all of your food from the fridge and wipe all the surfaces with a baking soda or vinegar solution. Regular maintenance will save you time and energy in the future. \n This almost goes without saying, but if you notice a spill or stain in the fridge, try to clean it up quickly and remove the source of the stain. Spills or stains that aren't cleaned quickly can set and become harder to remove in the future. \n Before food goes bad, and starts coating the inside of your fridge with regular blasts of bad odors, it's time to act. Here's what you can equip your fridge with to combat these smells: \n A clean sock filled with activated charcoal — from an aquarium store, not from your bbq briquettes. The charcoal absorbs bad odors for up to three months. \n An opened box of baking soda. Baking soda is another excellent odor absorber.Most baking soda packages say you should change your baking soda out every 30 days, but you can probably get away with 60 to 90 days of use before exchanging. \n Freshly ground coffee, placed in a small dish at the back of the fridge, also works very well at absorbing odors. \n Unscented chlorophyll cat litter is yet another odor buster. 1/2" kitty litter in a shallow pan at the back of the refrigerator should eliminate most offending smells. \n This may not be for everyone, but some people might enjoy the subtle hint of vanilla, for example, when they open their refrigerator. The operating word in this whole step is "subtle." You probably don't want any fragrance to be overwhelming upon opening of the fridge. Like cologne or perfume, a nice "afterthought" is much more pleasant, especially coupled with food: \n Sprinkle a little vanilla extract, tea tree oil, or essence of lavender, lemon, or even bergamot in a cotton ball and place the cotton ball in a small dish at the back of the fridge. Exchange every couple of weeks. \n A crumpled paper bag works wonders at removing smells in the crisper. \n 
 Conures are active birds that like to keep busy.Your conure will need a cage that gives him lots of space to move around and play with his toys.If you have a small conure, his cage should be at least 18 x 18 x 18 inches (46 x 46 x 46 centimeters).A larger conure would need a cage that is at least 36 x 36 x 36 inches (91 x 91 x 91 centimeters). The cage can be either horizontal or vertical.The cage bars should be horizontal so your conure can climb on them.The bars should be spaced no further than 3/4 inches to one inch (two to 2.5 cm) apart. \n Consider purchasing a cage cover to give your conure a sense of security when he sleeps.Alternatively, you could use a blanket or large towel to cover his cage at night.\n Your conure’s cage should be in a room that is not in the direct path of harmful kitchen fumes.Within the room, make sure not to place the cage in direct sunlight.Conures are most comfortable in rooms that are 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C), which is the typical room temperature for most homes. \n The room should also be free of drafts.Many types of fumes are toxic to conures, including perfumes, aerosols, and fumes from cleaning products and non-stick cookware. \n Perches are an essential item in any bird’s cage. For your conure, choose at least two perches that are 1/2 to 5/8 inches (about 1.5 centimeters) in diameter. \n Position the perches such that your conure’s tail feathers will not rub against the cage bars when she sits on the perches.Place one perch close to your conure's food and water dishes.Consider using perches that have various sizes, shapes, and textures. This will help keep your conure's feet healthy and strong.Many types of perches are available at your local pet store. \n Place two to three food and water dishes in her cage. One dish would be for water and one or two would be for food. \n Conures love to take baths. Place another water dish in your conure's cage,preferably one that is large enough for her to step in. Look for these dishes at your local pet store or housewares store. \n Line the bottom of your conure’s cage with newspaper or paper liners., Conures can be messy, so you will need to maintain a regular cleaning schedule for your conure’s cage. On a daily basis, you should clean his water and food dishes.Conures like to dip their food in their food bowls, so you may need to clean your conure’s water dish several times a day.Replace the cage lining each day.Clean your conure’s toys and perches on a daily basis. Dishwater detergent is sufficient for cleaning these accessories. Make sure to completely rinse off the soap before placing the cleaned items back in your conure's cage.Depending on how messy your conure is, you will need to disinfect his cage either weekly or monthly.Since bleach fumes can be toxic to your conure, you will need to keep him in a separate room when you disinfect his cage and allow it to dry.Speak with an avian veterinarian or avian expert about safe cleaning products to use in your conure’s cage. \n Conures like to be kept busy. Without things to do, your conure could become bored and resort to feather picking.Giving your conure a variety of toys will keep her happily entertained. Popular toy types for conures include foraging toys, wooden chew toys, and shredding toys.Foraging toys mimic your conure’s natural food foraging behavior in the wild.Shredded toys can help your conure relieve stress and boredom.If you don’t want to purchase a shredded toy, you can place some newspaper in the cage for him or her to shred. \n Avoid toys that have small parts. These parts could catch on your conure’s beak or claws, possibly leading to damage or injury.Keep different types of toys at your conure’s cage at all times to prevent boredom with any one toy. \n Consider installing a play stand in your conure’s cage that can hold toys.All types of toys can be found at your local pet store. \n Conures need lots of exercise to stay happy and healthy. Swings, and ladders would provide your conure with plenty of exercise during the day.For the ladders and swings, install them at heights inside the cage that will keep your conure’s tail from rubbing up against the cage bars. \n Mirrors can be a good choice of enrichment to keep your conure busy. However, introduce him to a mirror only after he has bonded with you—otherwise he may bond with the mirror instead of you!Mirrors can also encourage mating behavior (e.g., regurgitating food, tail lifting).Mating behavior can be especially problematic in female birds, since they can lay eggs without a mate. If you have a female conure, mating behavior can lead to spontaneous egg laying that could result in physical stress and illness.Your conure could see the mirror as a "love toy."Speak with your veterinarian if you are unsure about placing shiny objects in your conure’s cage. \n Pelleted bird food is commercially available at your local pet store. Pellets should make up approximately 60 to 70% of your conure’s diet and seeds no more than 10% and fruits and veggies for the rest. They can come in different colors, which adds a little variety to an otherwise uninteresting food.Pelleted bird food, along with seed mixes, provide a good, nutritious diet. \n Some commercial seed mixes have fillers or harmful additives.Ask an avian veterinarian or the staff at your local pet store if you are unsure about which pelleted food and seed mix would be best for your conure, or select a seed mix that is labeled as "organic" or "all natural." \n Variety is key to feeding your conure a nutritionally balanced diet. Fruits and vegetables are a great way to add this variety. Examples of fresh vegetables to feed your conure are collard greens, spinach, pumpkins, and zucchini.There are many types of fruit you can feed your conure, such as mangoes, blueberries, kiwi, and apples.Fruits and vegetables also add important vitamins and minerals to your conure’s diet.Wash the fruits and vegetables thoroughly with water to remove pesticides.Consider purchasing organic produce but not  avocado because it is poisonous to your bird.Cut the produce into smaller pieces. \n Nuts add healthy protein and fat to your conure’s diet, and should be a mainstay in her daily eating regimen.Examples of nuts to feed your conure are hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, peanuts, and brazil nuts.The nuts should be low in salt. \n Although important, nuts should be fed only in small amounts because of their high fat content. Your conure could become obese if she eats a lot of nuts.If you feed your conure peanuts, they must be unshelled. Peanut shells contain a fungal toxin called aflatoxin that could make your conure very sick., In addition to nuts, grains and legumes are mainstays of a conure diet. There are many types of healthy grains you can feed your conure, such as cooked brown rice or barley, as well as cereal, pasta, and crackers.Conures cannot break down sugar very well, so avoid sugary cereals. \n Examples of legumes are lentils and different types of beans (e.g., green beans, black beans).Legumes and grains have vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are essential components of your conure’s diet., You may need to supplement your conure’s diet with certain nutrients, including calcium and vitamin K. Incorporate foods into his diet (dark leafy greens, soy oil, and fish meal) that are high in these nutrients.Adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin K are important to prevent a condition called Conure Bleeding Syndrome.Calcium perches are available that your conure can chew on to get extra calcium in his diet.Cuttlebone is another calcium source, but is not recommended for conures.Water-soluble vitamins can be added to your conure’s water. \n Speak with your veterinarian before supplementing your conure’s diet. \n Conures are not picky eaters.However, there are certain foods that she should not eat. For example, your conure should not eat avocados, cocoa, or onions.These foods contain toxins that could sicken your conure. \n Human foods that are high in sugar, salt, or fat should also be avoided, since a conure’s digestive system cannot break them down very well.Processed foods tend to be high in these ingredients. \n Feed your conure once in the morning and once in the evening. At each feeding time, place a variety of fresh foods, cooked foods, and seeds in his food dishes. After about one hour, remove any remaining food.In the morning, give him some pellets after you have removed the other food. He can snack on the pellets throughout the day.Conures are prone to obesity. To prevent him from overeating at mealtime, feed him only as much as he can eat in one sitting.It will probably take some trial and error to determine how much to feed him at mealtime. \n Since conures are messy eaters and like to dip their food in their water, you may have to replace your conure’s water dish at each meal time. \n Since conures are very social and outgoing birds, interacting with your conure is important to his overall care. To have quality interactions with her, you will first need to gain her trust. One way to gain her trust is to talk to her in a smooth and calming voice.Talk to her throughout the day, especially when you are feeding her and cleaning her cage. \n The more she hears your voice when you are near her, the more comfortable she will be with you. \n Another way to gain her trust is to approach her cage slowly and calmly. When she sees that you are not a threat, she will be much more at ease when you are nearby. \n In addition to trusting you, your conure will also need to be comfortable with your hand. Begin by gently placing your hand either on or near the outside of his cage.Talk to him while you hold your hand nearby to calm his anxiety. \n When your conure is comfortable with your hand outside his cage, slowly place your hand inside his cage.Hold some treats (e.g., millet spray, dark leafy greens) in your hand and keep your hand still while he approaches and explores your hand. \n It may a few days or a few weeks before your conure is comfortable with your hand. Just be patient with him. \n When your conure trusts you and is comfortable with you, you can have all types of fun with her. For example, you can teach her to step up. Using your index finger as a perch, gently press your finger against her lower chest (just above her feet) to encourage her to step up onto your finger.Give her a treat and verbal praise when she steps onto your finger. \n When she gets good at stepping onto your finger, you can take her out of his cage and practice stepping up in a different room, such as the bathroom. \n Parrots are known for their ability to talk. However, conures are not as good as other parrot species when it comes to talking ability.Try as he might, your conure will probably be able to learn only about five or ten words. \n Your conure will need to focus all of his attention on you to learn how to talk. Turn off any other noises (television, radio, phone) that may distract him.Choose simple words and phrases, and associate them with a specific object or action.For example, you can say "Are you hungry?" when you feed him and "Goodbye!" when you leave the room. \n Speak with enthusiasm to your conure. The more excited you sound, the more excited and motivated he will be to mimic your words.Your conure’s voice will be high pitched., Another way to interact with her is to help her take her morning bath. Use a spray bottle to gently spritz her with a mist of water.If she will let you, gently wrap your conure in a towel after her bath and hold her close to you until she is dry.Conures are very cuddly, so your conure will probably enjoy being so close to you after a good bath. \n When she is dry, your conure will preen herself. To preen, she will use her beak to reach back to her oil gland (located at the base of her tail) and spread the oil over her plumage., Believe it or not, conures have rhythm and like to dance!When your conure is excited or is trying to copy your movements, he will sway back and forth. If you like to dance, turn on some music and dance in front of your conure. Watch in amusement as he sways from side to side to match your movement. \n Playing with your conure is a great way to interact with her. A simple game is "peek a boo." Simply wrap her in a towel and say "peek a boo" when you uncover her face.Do this any many times as you want—chances are your conure will love to play this with you over and over. \n Play fetch with your conure. Toss a soft stuffed toy towards your conure.Be aware that she might not be very good at catching what you toss, but she will have fun anyway. She may even toss the toy back to you.Mimic your conure’s actions and vice versa. For example, when your conure stretches her wings, stretch your arms out in response.Move side to side, and see if your conure will do the same. \n Make a mess with your conure. Conures love to shred things. When you have your conure out of her cage, sit on the floor with her and make a mess by shredding some newspaper. Give her her own newspaper to shred., Conure owners like to teach this popular trick to their birds. With your conure perched on your finger outside of his cage, place him against your chest with his back facing away from you. Gently place your free hand on his back and begin to bend your body forward very slowly. \n Keep your hand on your conure’s back as you bend forward. Lying back may feel a bit strange to your conure at first, so he will need your hand on his back to feel more secure with this movement. \n When he is comfortable lying back on your hand, you can play with him by tickling his tummy.You could also give him small toys that he can play with when lying on his back.When your conure can lie back, you can teach him more advanced tricks like doing back rolls., As important as it is to interact with your conure, you should not pay her attention when she screeches. Conures are prone to making very loud noises.As ear piercing as these screeches can be, do your best to ignore her when makes this noise. \n If you go over to her cage when she screeches, she may learn that she can screech to get your attention. To her, your attention is a reward for her behavior. \n Interacting with your conure on a regular basis and giving him plenty of toys to play with may help to temper his screeches. \n Molting happens to a bird when its feathers naturally shed and new ones replace the old ones. Molting is necessary to any bird's (including conures') growth., Molting begins when the conure is around 8 to 10 months of age and continues on every year. The season in which molting occurs depends on the species of the conure., The conure will be more annoyed and won't be too cooperative. The conure will feel itch due to the new feathers growing out. Water could be sprayed on the conure to relieve the itchiness., This could be done by gently brushing your hand on the conure's body to help the new feathers to come out. If you have a couple of conures who are molting at the same time, the conures can support each other by preening each other and rubbing their bodies against each other.Preen gently as new feathers could be painful to the conure when touched. \n 
 If it's not on the Dock, you can find it in your Applications folder, or search for it in Spotlight.\n To make a movie with iMovie, you must first import the video from your camera to your computer. Most cameras make this a fairly painless process using either USB or Firewire cables directly from the camera, or flash memory cards such as Secure Digital (SD) or CompactFlash (CF) connected through a card reader. You can also import movies from the iPhone or the iPad through the normal 30-pin or Lightning connector. \n Connect the most appropriate cable to your camera. Using the cable that came with your camcorder, connect the small end to the camera, and the larger end to your computer. \n Power on your camera, and set it play out through the cable. This function will have different names depending on the brand and model of camera you are using. It might be PC \n Select the image definition of your movie. If you are shooting HD video, select that, or select "Large," or "Full" in the import window. If it doesn't open automatically, select "Import from Camera" from the File menu. \n The Import window will show you all the clips available on your camera. (Every time you stop and start your camera, you're creating a new clip).You can choose to import all the available clips, or click to deselect the clips you don't want to import, then click "Import Checked." \n If you're using a tape-based camcorder, you can import everything, or use the on-screen camcorder controls to fast-forward or rewind to locate a particular piece of film you want to import, and use the Play and Stop controls to start and stop the import. \n Make sure you choose a location with a lot of room: video files, especially HD files, can be quite large. You don't want to run out of room before you even get started! \n \n The first time you import video from your camera, there won’t be any existing events in your Event Library. \n To create a new event, type a name for it in the “Create new Event” field. \n If you’re importing video that recorded on different days, you can have iMovie create a new Event for each of those days by selecting “Split days into new Events.” \n To append the new video to an existing event—video that you imported into iMovie previously—select “Add to Existing Event”. Edit the new event’s name from the pop-up menu. \n Choose "Stabilization" from the "After import analyze for" menu. iMovie will analyze your footage, and smooth any shaky cam motion (such as you might remember from a film like "The Blair Witch Project." \n The other option in the Analyze menu is to search your footage for people. This will place markers in the footage when iMovie detects the presence of humans. \n Both stabilization and searching for people can take a long time to complete. \n If you are importing HD video, choose a size for the movie from the "Optimize video" popup menu. When all your settings are set, click the OK button and take a break. It will take anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour. \n First, from the File menu, select "New Project…" or press Command-N. This will create the basic project framework. With that created, you can add a theme to your movie. iMovie comes pre-loaded with a number of unique and interesting themes that help give your movie a unique, interesting look and feel. There is everything from a scrapbook theme to a Hollywood blockbuster movie. Preview the options, select the one you like—or select "No Theme" if you want to roll your own, then click the Create button. \n Before you add content, you have to give that content somewhere to go. \n Next to the Themes list, assign a name of your project in the "Name:" field. \n Choose an aspect ratio for your movie. The aspect ratio is a dimension describing the height and width ratios. For example, iPads and iPhones before the iPhone 5, standard TV screens, and older computer monitors have a 4:3 aspect ratio. Newer televisions and monitors will use the widescreen 16:9 format. \n Choose a frame rate for your video. Use the same rate the video was shot using. Most video cameras in the U.S. use "30 fps - NTSC," whereas European cameras generally use "25 fps - PAL." If your camera supports 24 fps, and you elected to shoot with that format, then choose that option. \n When you join two clips together, you have several ways of moving between them. You can set up iMovie to always chose a particular transition, though you may switch any preset transition at any time. \n The Project Themes automatically add cross dissolves (gradual crossfades between one clip and the next) and other transitions, but allow you to deselect that option if desired. \n When you're done setting up your project, click the "Create" button, and the new blank project will open in the Project Browser window. \n Once you've defined a new project, you can add video clips into the movie. All the clips you imported will be listed in the Event Library section below your Project Library and Preview screen. \n If you closed iMovie before beginning this section, launch iMovie, then double click on the Project Name of the project you created earlier. \n If you want to change projects, click on the Project Library button, and choose one from the list. \n In the Event library, all events available will be listed. Select the event you wish to work with by clicking once on it. \n If you don't see the event list, look in the lower left hand corner of the iMovie window. \n Select clip or a range of video frames from the film strips in the Event Library. \n To select an entire clip, hold down the Shift key, then click once on the clip once, so that it’s outlined in yellow. \n To select a specific range or section of a clip, click and hold on a section of the clip, then drag across the clip while holding down the button on your mouse or trackpad. Selected frames are outlined in yellow. \n Drag your video selection to the Project browser in the top left of the screen. A vertical green line, along with a green Add (+) symbol, appears anywhere you can place the clip. \n Drag in each clip, or section of a clip, into the Project browser in any order you prefer. You can place the clips sequentially, or place a clip between two others. \n You can add more than movies to iMovie, and add a documentary feel to your film by adding still photographs. Whether scanned or shot digitally, the process is the same. \n Click on the camera icon located on the lower right side of the screen, above the video clips. The Photo Browser will slide in from the right, and lets you choose all the files in your iPhoto library. \n If you haven't imported you're stills into iPhoto, you can do so, then click on the Last Import button to see only those images. Otherwise, you can simply drag them in from wherever they are located on your hard drive—though keeping all your images together in one folder is best. \n If you drag it before or after a clip, there will be a green vertical line, indicating that it's safe to place the image in that spot. \n If the line is red, you are placing the image in the middle of an existing clip, and you'll be asked if you wish to replace the existing clip, insert the clip, or cancel the operation. \n You can intersperse still images in between a clip of an action scene—for example, grabbing a clip of a snowboarder catching air, extracting a single frame in mid-jump, and then placing that in the video where it was cut from. \n You can set the duration of the still, so the end result will be something like: jump begins, boarder starts to lose balance, freeze! The clip lingers on the boarder, giving your audience a moment to realize what's about to happen, then unfreeze! The jump completes, and the boarder does a yard sale—exactly as expected. You could top it off with another still of the the boarder smiling with a face full of snow! \n Once you have everything in place, you can add elements to your film to really make it look special. You can use (or change) themes, add transitions, music, and titles. \n If you didn't choose a theme at the beginning, you can add one now. From the File menu, choose "Project Theme…" or press Shift-Command-J. \n Fine one of the thumbnails that you like (you can preview them by clicking them), and choose whether or not to include the automatic transitions. \n When you select a theme, you will see a 30-second sample video so you know what to expect. \n If you're new to iMovie, use the automatic transitions and titles option. It will help you get a feel for how they work, and you can always change or edit them later. \n Make your choice by selecting or un-selecting the "Automatically add transitions and titles" checkbox. \n You can add transitions between clips by opening the Transitions browser on the iMovie toolbar. \n Select the desired transition, then drag it between two clips. iMovie will automatically manage the transition. You can easily change transitions by double clicking on the transition icon in your movie, and selecting a new one from the popup menu. \n A movie without music is what they used to call a "slide show." Nobody liked to sit through those back when that was the only way to see those vacation pics, let alone now, when it's so easy to do. \n This will switch the browser from your photo library to your iTunes library, as well as your Garage Band folder and Sound Effects folders. \n Look through your list of music until you find the song you want to add. When you find an appropriate selection, click on the song, and drag it to the end of the video clips in the Project browser. Don't drag it over a particular clip. When you see the green vertical line, release the mouse, and your clip will be placed into the movie. \n The background behind the movie clips will be shaded green for the duration of the music clip, beginning at the first clip in your movie, and ending at the end of the music. Note that this may end before your video track, or go beyond your video track. If the music is too short, you can always add another clip at the end of the project. If it's too long, you can fade it out at the end. \n In the Music and Sound Effects browser, there is a sound effects folder. Click on that, and select a sound effect for a spot in the movie. For example, if you have a clip of people walking, you can add footsteps to the movie, even if you have background music! Drag the sound effect to the first frame you want it to appear. If it's too short, add another sound effect, or if too long, trim and fade out as desired. (See following). \n If the music or effects are too long, too loud, or you want to add some studio effects, click the Action pop-up menu (the gear icon at the top left of the green audio clip), and then click on Audio Adjustments. Play your movie. As long as the Inspector window is open, your movie will loop through the selected sound—making it easy to adjust the settings for short snippets of audio like sound effects, so they're not too loud, or too soft. \n In the resulting Inspector window, you can adjust the volume, fade in or fade out, EQ, and other adjustments as desired. \n Volume: adjusts the volume of the selected audio track. \n Ducking: drops the volume of all other audio tracks. This is useful if you have a clip of somebody talking over background music. Ducking makes the volume of the background music lower, so the voice can be heard more clearly. \n Fade In/Fade Out: lets you ease in or out of a sound by a specified duration. Click on which one you want to alter, then drag the sliders to the set the length of time for each. \n Reduce Background Noise: reduces "noisy" sounds, useful for traffic, crowds, etc., to make voices more intelligible. Too much can eliminate background sounds completely. \n EQ: this is just like the EQ on your stereo, and adjusts the tonal qualities of the sound. \n Normalize Clip Volume: this will make the loudest sound in the clip as loud as possible without distortion, making every other sound in the clip louder as well (unless the loudest sound is already at maximum, in which case this will have no noticeable impact on the sound. You can remove added normalization by clicking the "Remove Normalization" button below it. \n At the top of the audio Inspector window, click the Clip button, and then the "Audio Effect:" popup menu. \n Audition the reverbs, echoes, and pitch effects by rolling over them (not clicking), and if any are desirable, click on them. \n When you're satisfied with all adjustments, click Done, and your choices will be saved. \n You can add text anywhere within the movie, and at the beginning or end as credits. \n A series of different text treatments appear. To add those to your movie, click and drag one to the relevant clip. \n Replace the temporary text with words of your own, as necessary. To alter the font, right click on the text and select "Show Fonts" from the menu. Choose from the available list or click "System Font Panel" at the bottom left of the window, and choose from your available fonts. There are 9 different color options in the basic panel, but you can set any desired color in the System font panel. \n Select the title clip in the Project browser, and adjust the length as desired by clicking on the side, and dragging in necessary direction. \n To view the Title inspector, double click on the title clip. \n If you didn't use a stock theme, you can add credits at the end by dragging the Scrolling Credits title to the end of the movie, and filling in the correct credits. \n iTunes will build your project, with all transitions, effects, titles, and settings baked in. Depending on the length and complexity of your movie, this could take an hour or two, so be ready to take a break! \n When you're done, your movie will be ready to play, burn to DVD, or upload to YouTube. Congratulations! \n

Killing the web connection reduces odds that your private keys will not be leaked over the internet without you knowing it. Bitadress.org was designed to run just fine without an internet connection.,  This random movement generates a random seed that BitAddress will use to generate your wallet., Congrats, you just created a basic, low security paper wallet! \n On the left is a your Bitcoin address. In the example in the photo the address is "15TfQt6RyNrqjJknd3b3CRkbwfXJ3i3BNC".  Think of this as your email address.  It's OK to share it in public so people (or yourself) can send Bitcoin to the address. \n On the right is your private key. In this example it's "L4vfUiBm9XGeaXk8HWPkQfiTogQoZC6kzNnyPnqGEoBQaRXoAYkT" Think of this as the password to your email address.  Never, ever share your private key with anyone or store it on a computer or the web.  Anyone who can access your private key can immediately and irretrievably empty your wallet. \n If you are storing a small amount of Bitcoin and are OK with low security you can print out this wallet and stop now.  If you need higher security continue following the steps in Part 2 of this article. \n Treat it like gold or jewelry.  If someone finds it and takes it, they can easily empty your wallet. Store a backup copy of the wallet in another secure location.\n It's also possible to do this with the other options such as Bulk Wallet, but for the sake of simplicity we'll use the Paper Wallet example. \n Create a long passphrase that you do not use anywhere else. Store that passphrase separately from your bitcoin wallet., Congrats you have now created 3 high security paper wallets with encrypted private keys! \n Unlike in the example Part 1, the private key in this wallet is not stored in plain text. You will need to use your passphrase to open the wallet.  This additional layer of security makes your wallet much more secure. \n  By not using the network to print, you avoid the albeit low risk that your network is compromised and might read your private keys. \n Print multiple copies of your paper wallet. This is a beauty of BIP38 paper wallets, you can have multiple backups, one in a bank safe deposit box, one in a home safe, one with your law firm, or whatever -- when BIP 38 protected all you have to be is trusting enough that the bank or whoever has it won't do a brute force attack. \n  Close the private window on your browser and verify that no copies were stored in the cache. Close your browser. Reboot your computer.  Only then can you turn your internet back on., You now have encrypted paper wallets that have never accessed the internet. Read Part 3 below to learn how to safely use these paper wallets.,  If you want you can send a very small amount of bitcoin to one wallet for testing you can do that, or you can practice with an empty wallet.  Either way works. The following steps will explain the procedure., This example will use Blockchain.info, which is open source, free and the most popular web wallet as of June 2016. Go to Blockchain.info and follow their steps to create a wallet.,  On the next screen click "Import Address"., Put the private key QR code from your paper wallet in front of the webcam till you get the verification checkmark.  This can take a little futzing to make work.  It helps to have good lighting and to keep the QR code in focus., If all works out, you will be notified that you have successfully opened your private wallet.  Congrats! You've successfully decrypted your test wallet! \n Now that you have exposed the private key of this paper wallet to the internet, do not use it to store funds. Put this wallet away and don't use it again. \n Repeat the above steps with other paper wallets if you think you need practice decrypting.  Make sure you've figured this step out before placing real funds in the wallet. \n Note that this process is the exact same process you will use to spend or move bitcoins from your paper wallet. The reason we are testing them now is to make sure you can successfully get your coins off your paper wallet when you are ready to do it. \n Do not proceed to later steps until you are confident you can decrypt wallets with your passphrase. \n You do this by using your public bitcoin address.  So say you having your friend send you bitcoin, just email or text her your bitcoin address.  Or if you bought coins on a bitcoin exchange like Kraken, Circle or Coinbase, log in to your exchange account and send the bitcoin from there to your bitcoin address. \n Do not reuse any of the wallets your opened during testing. Use a brand new one. \n You can do this using any of the blockchain watching services.  Blockchain.info is helpful here.  Just go to the Blockchain.info homepage and enter your bitcoin address (but not your private key) into the search field.  You should see exactly how much bitcoin your wallet holds., Your coins are now safely locked into your paper wallet.  As long as you don't ever enter your private key to just "check" on your wallet, your funds will stay totally safe. \n As long as only you have the ability to access both your private key and passphrase remain your funds will stay safe for years. This security costs you absolutely nothing. No bank fees ever. \n Keep a backup in another location in case the first location is burned down or flooded. Store the BIP38 passphrase in a still separate location. It's okay to leave the passphrase in a computer or password manager program. Access to your BIP38 passphrase without your wallet's private keys can cause you no damage., If you want to spend or move your bitcoins it's important that you don't leave any funds in the paper wallet you spent with. If you do want to spend with your wallet, sweep all the funds into an online wallet like Blockchain.info and use all the funds there. Do not attempt to reuse a paper wallet.
 As soon as the noodles have come to a boil, turn off the heat and strain the noodles. Submerge shirataki in a bowl of cool water. \n The shirataki shouldn’t need much cooking. Rather, the par-boiling is designed to remove some of the odor from the noodles. Then the shirataki can absorb the full flavor of the sukiyaki sauce. \n If using other kinds of noodles, look at instructions and par boil until they are only a couple minutes away from being al dente.\n Sukiyaki calls for very thin beef. Choose a marbled sirloin (or similar) cut for very good results. \n Place the beef in the freezer for a couple of hours if you want to slice the beef yourself. When hard but not completely frozen through, beef is much easier to slice very thin., The stalks of the cabbage are a little more fibrous and take longer to cook. Therefore, cut right around the stalks of the cabbage until the stalks can be separated from the leaves. Cut the stalks into 1-inch (or smaller) pieces. Coarsely chop the leaves into larger pieces. \n If you weren't able to get shiitake mushrooms, cut whatever mushrooms you have into bite-size pieces. If you were able to get the shiitake, here's how to traditionally prepare them: \n Remove the stem from the shiitake with a knife. Score a small star or cross into the cap of the mushroom with a knife. Imagine a straight line going through the middle of the cap. Take a knife and make a 30° angled cut along this straight line, digging only a small amount of flesh from the mushroom, enough to show the whites. Angle the knife in the opposite direction and make another 30° cut along the other side of the line. Repeat this process at the perpendicular to make a cross, and once more to make a star. \n For enoki mushrooms, simply wash and cut off the root bulb to prepare. \n If substituting spinach or watercress, rinse thoroughly and separate the leaves from the stalks. Discard the stalks. \n In a pot, bring 1/2 cup sake, 1/2 cup mirin, 1/3 cup soy sauce, and 1/4 cup sugar to a boil over medium heat. As soon as boil is reached, remove the sukiyaki sauce from the heat. The goal is to burn off the alcohol from the sake, not reduce the sauce. \n The traditional way of cooking sukiyaki involves an earthenware or cast iron hot pot with a kerosene burner underneath. This way the chef can cook at the table where he intends to serve. Alternately, an electric pan can be put to great use to cook at the table as well. \n If you have neither a hot pot or an electric pan to cook with, you can of course cook the sukiyaki on the burner away from the table. Just make sure to choose a large pot with an accompanying lid. \n Beef suet is traditional, but lard or even vegetable oil can be used if the aim is a healthier meal. \n You will keep the beef in the pot while the other ingredients cook, so be careful not to overcook it. Once the beef loses its pinkness, move it over to the side of the pan so it doesn't cook at quickly. \n Some cooks introduce a little bit of the sukiyaki sauce to the pan while they are cooking the beef.The sukiyaki sauce will bubble and reduce quickly because of the soy sauce. \n Other cooks prefer sweetening the beef a little with plain sugar while it’s frying in the pan with the fat. There's no reason you can't do both. \n Keep all ingredients separate; each separate ingredient should be bunched together on the pan. \n Since shirataki contains a compound that makes beef tough, segregate it from the beef while all the ingredients are cooking. \n Introduce the cabbage leaves, chrysanthemum, and onions into the remaining spots of the pot. \n Traditionally, a dipping sauce of raw eggs is served alongside sukiyaki.The combination may not sound especially appetizing to westerners, but it is a surprisingly good combination, even if you aren’t predisposed to liking it. \n If you are worried about uncooked eggs carrying salmonella or don’t like the flavor, omit them. For what it’s worth, salmonella is very rare in raw eggs., Simply grab whatever looks appetizing out of the hot pot and dip it into the egg. \n If you are not eating with family or close friends, use the thicker ends of your chopsticks to grab food out communal pots. This is considered polite. \n If there are leftovers that didn’t find into the first generation of the meal, cook them now in the remaining broth. Meat and leafy greens will take less time to cook than vegetables will. \n In Japan, it is traditional to use the leftover broth as the broth for udon noodles. If you don't have enough broth but wish to make more, use the recipe for sukiyaki sauce above and combine it with the remaining sauce. Heat the broth back up to boiling, then reduce the heat to a simmer. If the broth tastes too overpowering, cut the broth with 1/3 cup of water and taste again. \n

 Make sure you have all 10 digits available before you arrange to block it. \n AT&T does not have the capability to block anonymous numbers from your phone. If the number you dislike is from "Private Number" or "Anonymous" you should ask the person or telemarketer to remove you from their phone or list and never call you in the future. \n It is a good idea to enroll your number in the US "Do Not Call" registry no matter what wireless service you use. It will be the cheapest option to block numbers, if you are receiving unwanted calls from solicitors.\n The number is (888) 382-1222. \n The registry will pick up your cellular phone number automatically, but you may be asked to answer some questions regarding your number. \n This may take care of the problem. \n They are now in violation of the Do Not Call Act. \n Telemarketers in violation of the Act can be fined. \n You can also search for "Smart Limits for Wireless" in the search bar at att.com. \n It is free for 90 days, then it is $4.99 per month per mobile phone on the account. \n You will need to have the right login and the rights to make changes on the account to order Smart Limits. \n You can also go to an AT&T Wireless store with a copy of your latest bill or call the AT&T customer service number with your account number. \n Specify any more information as prompted until the transaction is complete. \n Type in up to 30 numbers to block from calling or texting your phone. \n You can also use other features with Smart Limits, such as controlling Internet browsing time, the number of texts the phone can use and limiting purchases from the account. \n 
 You should have at least an undergraduate degree in order to become a private banker. It is helpful (but not necessary) for the degree to have a concentration in a finance area.Good choices include finance, business administration, or economics.Otherwise the degree can be in any area you excel in. \n Many private bankers supplement their initial education with a master’s degree or even a Ph.D. in finance, business, or economics. \n An undergraduate degree is not a legal requirement, but may be the requirement of the bank for banking officers generally.\n However, any sort of experience in banking, investment, or related areas can be beneficial. If you gain some experience, then you can prove your capability to private banking firms who might hire you in the future. In addition, you may have the chance to network with HNWIs while completing an internship. \n Talk to professors, a university career center, and anyone you know working in a financial field about the possibility of doing an internship. Many private banking firms and other financial companies already have established internship programs, so you should check with these directly as well. \n These can raise your professional profile and the chances of landing your dream job. \n The Wealth Management Institute (WMI) offers the 10-week Wealth Management Private Banking Programme and an associated certificate.This course is comprised of several sessions covering topics such as understanding the needs of business owners, private equity and hedge funds, estate planning, and asset allocation. \n The Globecon Institute offers a nine-month course and certificate in “Private Banking and Wealth Management” as well as a three- to four-month course and certificate in “Operations in Investment Banking and Securities Markets.” \n In the United States, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) administer licenses that private bankers must have in order to collect commissions of the sale of financial products.The Series 6 license permits private bankers to advise clients on “packaged” products such as mutual funds, annuities, and trusts. The licensed is awarded by passing a 135-minute exam on investing, regulations, and ethics. In order to apply for the license, you must be sponsored by a firm that is a FINRA member. \n The Series 7 license allows private bankers to advise clients on individual securities such as stocks and bonds. The license is awarded by passing a 6-hour exam on securities trading. In order to apply for the license, you must be sponsored by a firm that is a FINRA member. \n The NASAA administers the Series 63 license that every state requires private bankers to have in order to advise clients on investments. The license is awarded by passing a 75-minute exam. You must have the Series 63 license before you can apply for the Series 6 or Series 7 license. \n The NASAA also administers the Series 65 license, which permits private bankers to advise clients for an hourly fee rather than a commission. This license is awarded by passing a 180-minute exam. \n Get to know some of these individuals and their needs very well. If you do not already know potential clients, then you will need to seek some through networking. Much of the networking for private bankers might take place in social or informal settings. \n Start by working with any HNWIs that you know. Have lunch with them, try to get invited to events they might attend with other HNWIs, etc. \n When you meet HNWIs, make sure to get their contact information (including social media profiles), and share yours with them. \n Once you form initial connections with HNWIs, begin asking them about meetings or informal events like a round of golf. Use these as an opportunity to get to know each other better. \n Be present at any events that HNWIs are likely to attend, such as fundraisers. These are opportunities to meet potential clients, but also to learn about what is important to them. \n Be firm about how you can help HNWIs with private banking services, but don’t be pushy. Show genuine care for their work and interests. \n You can work with these clients on your own, essentially setting up your own business. However, you may be more likely to attract and retain clients if you have the name recognition and security of an existing private banking firm, and so you may want to seek a job at one of these. \n If you do have a list of potential or current clients, ask them about whether or not they would be willing to have you continue advising them if you moved to an existing private banking firm. If so, mention this to firms that interview you or that you approach about a job. \n If you create a professional profile and make connections with others in private banking and other financial fields, then you have a better chance of being contacted about jobs that open up. \n Keep things professional. If you have social media accounts with public or semi-public profiles, make sure there is no content on them that you would not want clients to see. \n A general rule of thumb is if you would not share it with your grandmother, it should not appear on your social media profile. \n Focus on forging worthwhile, meaningful relationships rather than on increasing the sheer numbers of your followers, friends, or connections on social media. If you intend to use your social media accounts for professional purposes, then those relationships should be professional. \n If you have social media accounts and intend to use them professionally, then it is important to regularly check and update them. If an account has not been updated in awhile, it will look odd, and if you don’t check it regularly, then you might miss out on important communication or potential connections. \n Make sure that yours emphasizes your skills and experience in private banking and/or other financial fields, so that you increase your chances of landing an interview and your dream job. \n You can send out resumes to apply for any posted openings in or related to the private banking field. However, you can also communicate with institutions that aren’t currently hiring. Let them know you are working in or looking to enter the field. Give them a copy of your resume, and ask them to keep it on file in case they hire in the future. Showing initiative like this can be beneficial and make you a memorable job candidate. \n One alternative is to get a start in personal banking, providing services (investing, retirement planning, etc.) to regular individuals. While you wait for a job in private banking to materialize, you will gain useful banking experience. \n Personal banking is not a direct or obvious path to enter private banking. While serving in personal banking, you will still need to focus on networking with HNWIs who can potentially become your clients. \n In addition, you will need to aggressively seek any opportunities to move out of personal banking into private banking. Keep sending out resumes and holding informational interviews, let supervisors at your current institution know that you are looking to enter private banking, and keep offering to work with any HNWIs that you know. \n These are offered to select clients with larger portfolios or net worth (though not as high as HNWIs). Many of the same products and services offered to HNWIs are also offered to privilege banking customers, with the exception of hedge funds and private equity. \n Privilege banking can offer more opportunities to meet or network with HNWIs, so actively seek out these individuals while working in the field. \n In addition, continue to send out resumes and otherwise seek jobs in private banking. Stress how the skills you have developed in privilege banking will make you an effective private banker. \n These help with scheduling, documents, and other demands of private banking. There may also be occasional opportunities to meet with HNW clients, although assistants do not normally advise them on financial matters. \n If you are good at your job, your firm may eventually offer you some clients to service, or you may be able to take over the position when one of the firm’s private bankers retires or leaves. \n While this can provide you with knowledge and experience in the financial world, it will not provide the same opportunities to develop relationships with HNWIs. Thus, if you want to enter private banking from another area of finance, you will have to work hard to network with potential clients in addition to performing your regular job duties. \n This means constantly reading financial news and reports, keeping up with the fine details of investments, staying abreast of financial laws and regulations, etc. If you do not keep up with this knowledge, then you risk providing your clients with bad advice and losing them; without your clients, you will not be able to work as a private banker. \n To keep your clients happy (and gain new ones), you must be prepared to work very closely with them. \n Make sure that your clients can reach you at any time, and in many ways (phone, text, email, etc.). \n Be prepared to work long or odd hours in order to work around your clients’ schedules. \n Private bankers will benefit from knowing about their clients’ personal lives, family, businesses, etc. This knowledge can help you provide services and products that are tailored to a client’s specific situation. \n Be able to engage with clients about the world in general—current events, hobbies, politics, etc. HNW clients often want to see that their private bankers are well rounded, knowledgeable, and trustworthy, since that implies that they will provide excellent service. \n Don’t be surprised if your clients ask you to do things that may not seem directly related to financial matters. This may mean they ask you to discuss a deal over a round of golf; it might also mean that they ask you to pick up their pet from doggy daycare so that they will have time for a meeting. Remember that your clients are your number one priority, and be flexible in meeting their requests. \n Private bankers have to offer their clients excellent discretionary portfolio management.This service is “discretionary” in the sense that it is up to the portfolio manager (the private banker) to determine how to best maintain and grow a client’s assets. This involves: \n Understanding the whole range of investment products: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), etc. \n Having an in-depth knowledge of domestic and global markets, business trends, and investment strategies. \n Making superior buy and sell decisions of investment products, based on the private banker’s analysis of markets and trends.Determining how to allocate a client’s assets among different investment products in order to ensure that the client’s investment or personal goals are met. \n Working with clients to explain the risks of any investment, and how to recover from any losses. \n Each HNWI has different goals and needs, and your account management strategy will need to take these into account. \n Understand the different components of an individual’s wealth and estate, which may include retirement accounts, insurance packages, annuities, real estate, personal assets (such as homes, vehicles, art or other collections), etc. \n Advise your clients with both short-term and long-term goals in mind.Clients are interested in finding ways to make their wealth grow (short-term goals), but also think about how to maintain it for retirement, to pass on to descendants, etc. (long-term goals). \n Develop a flexible strategy for managing your clients’ wealth, since their needs and goals will change over time.For instance, you might advise a client to invest more aggressively when they are younger, in order to take advantage of opportunities for growth; as the client ages, however, you might advise them to stabilize their investments in order to protect them. \n Laws, regulations, and strategies regarding estates and trusts can be complex and very particular, and so a private banker will have to work hard to advise clients well in these areas. \n Private bankers may advise clients on financial aspects of wills and choosing an executor.Since different assets are subject to different regulations and strategies, private bankers assist clients in planning for each asset class. For instance, you may help a client decide to leave real estate as an estate for heirs, while utilizing other investments as a philanthropic gift. \n Many HNWIs plan to create trusts for their dependents, and a private banker will assist in the creation and management of these.Charitable gifts are another common part of estate planning, and private bankers are called upon to help clients select and structure these.Estate and gift taxes can be substantial, and so a major part of a private banker’s job can be helping clients plan to minimize these costs.Estate and trust plans will have to be reviewed and updated regularly, since clients’ needs and circumstances change over time. \n A key performance indicator (KPI) of private bankers is the amount of AUM they have.This refers to the amount of clients’ money and investments that you manage. It is directly related to the fees that you or your firm charges your clients, and thus to your commission and salary. To succeed as a private banker, you will need to keep your AUM high and growing by providing services and products to established and new clients. \n The salaries of private bankers working with established firms can vary widely, with estimates ranging from $30,000 to well over $100,000. Much of a private banker’s salary is determined by the value of AUM. \n In order to succeed in the long run, private bankers must always be thinking about the needs of their current clients as well as attracting new ones.

 \n If someone says you are a racist person, this suggests a bigger problem. Maybe you've done multiple things that came off as racist. Or maybe they're just having a really awful day.\n When someone says they think you're a racist, take them seriously. Make time to listen to their concerns. \n Let the other party talk first before you respond; do not interrupt the other speaker. Then, in a calm and measured way, say, “Wow, I am very concerned that you consider me a racist. I’m interested in discussing this matter further. Let’s do so in the privacy of (my office, a cafe, a quiet room, etc.).” \n If there is a power imbalance, they may be afraid to speak to you in a completely private place. If so, try a semi-public place, like a restaurant, a park bench, etc. \n Especially if they are a minority, they may be afraid of you, so do your best to put them at ease. This shows them that you are an understanding person who is willing to listen. \n For example, “I'm sorry if I've said or done anything hurtful. I'm really concerned about this. I want people of all races to feel safe and relaxed around me, so if I'm making people uncomfortable, I want to hear about it so I can learn from it.” \n Listen closely to what they have to say.It may be that you've made some mistakes, or that you said things that were interpreted differently than you intended. \n Tell them, “I want to know why you think this. What have I done that's racist?” Listen attentively to their response. \n Show sympathy for any racism they've faced, whether it was a misunderstanding or not. Make it clear that you care about their pain. (Some of it might be from other experiences that were not your fault.) This will help them feel calmer, and feel like they can trust you. \n For example, “That must be difficult,” “I'm sorry to hear that you had to deal with that,” and “that's too bad” are examples of validating statements. \n If you are white and the other person is a person of color, they probably know more about racism than you do. Listen carefully to their explanations; you may be surprised. \n They might think you’re racist because you support racist policies such as criminalization of certain drugs or exclusionary zoning policies. While such policies in theory are not aimed specifically at minorities, their implementation and impact are decidedly biased for or against a given race and therefore racist.Expressing support for politicians who pursue strengthening these policies might be perceived as racist. \n Finally, the most obvious and common definition of racism is one in which a person believes one race is superior or inferior to another. Using explicit racial slurs, supporting slavery/segregation/deportation, believing race drives behavior (e.g. "Mexicans are rapists"), are all examples of serious racism. If you said “I believe it was a mistake to free the slaves,” for instance, you are a racist. \n If you don't understand, ask. “I don't understand why that's racist. Would you please explain for me?” \n Mentions of your black friend, your Asian boyfriend, your time volunteering with Latinx children, etc. aren't going to fix things.Mentioning your ancestry doesn't help, either; just because you are of a minority race, doesn't mean you can't be racist to those of other minority races. Not all racists are hateful people who burn crosses, and you can be accidentally racist even while disliking racism in general. \n Remind yourself that in the West, where governments and societies have long been controlled and guided by white men, everyone is racist to some degree or another. Recount to your accuser that many examples of unconscious racial bias exist in you, and that you will try to do better.Use the specific circumstances of the conversation or situation which led to you being accused of racism in order to clarify your position on the issue at hand. \n It may have been that you said something that sounded racist, even if that's not how you meant it. If so, apologize for the misunderstanding and any discomfort on their part, and clarify what you truly meant. \n For example, “What I meant to say is that I disagree with Obama's policies, and dislike what he's done with the country. I am glad that America has had its first black president, and hope there will be many more. I'm sorry if I gave you the impression otherwise. That is definitely not what I meant.” \n Acknowledge any surprise you feel. For example, “Oh, no, I'm so sorry! I'm surprised and horrified if my words came out that way! I think your fiancee is charming, including her dark skin! And I'm happy to have her joining the family, I promise, and I will call her and tell her that today.” \n \n Think about your culture’s history in a framework which acknowledges the structural challenges to a fully egalitarian society. You have most likely absorbed some cultural biases without knowing. \n List some examples to demonstrate you understand the issue. Listening less intently to minorities; showing more caution around people of color; and being less likely to hire someone whose name is not traditional or sounds ethnic are just some of the many unconscious but racially biased behaviors everyone in a white society will likely exhibit., If you unintentionally hurt someone, own up to it and apologize. If they aren't ready to forgive you, ask if and how you can make it up to them. You want the person to walk away feeling satisfied and safe around you. \n If someone was insulted, tell them a few things that you admire about them. Explain that you value them as a friend/colleague/mother-in-law/etc., and assure them that the racist remark doesn't reflect your feelings about them. \n For a friend or loved one, spend some extra time on the relationship. Take them somewhere fun, do something nice for them, or take extra quality time together. \n If someone doesn't want to see you, give them space for as long as they need. This shows that you respect their wishes. \n If they publicly called you names, ask them if they would rescind it.If you've been empathetic and willing to make amends, they will most likely agree. If they refuse, you can do little about it, but continue to explain yourself and let people know, if necessary, that you and the accuser have buried the hatchet, and you've made amends for any racist actions. \n At the end of the conversation with the person who called you a racist, ask gently, “Are you satisfied with how this turned out? Do you still consider me a racist or bad person? If not, would you please let others know? I want to move on from this, and would like to keep my reputation intact if possible.” \n 
 This is useful because conditional formatting is best understood by testing it on data you already have. While you can apply conditional formatting to empty cells, it is easiest to see if the formatting works by using pre-existing data.\n Conditional formatting allows you to change font style, underline, and color. Using conditional formatting, you can also apply strike-through as well as borders and shading to the cells. However, you cannot change the font or the font size of the contents in the cell. \n In Excel 2007 this can be found under "Home" > "Styles" > "Conditional Formatting". \n For this example, two conditions are used to see how each one plays off the other. Excel allows up to three conditions per cell. If you need only one condition, skip the next step. \n If it is based on other cells, change the first drop-down to “Formula Is." For “Formula Is" directions, go to the next step. For “Cell Value Is" directions, do the following: \n Select what kind of argument works best using the second drop-down box. For conditions between a low setting and a high setting, select “between" or “not between." For conditions using a single value, use the other arguments. This example will use a single value using the “greater than" argument. \n Determine what value(s) should be applied to the argument. For this example, we are using the “greater than" argument and cell B5 as the value. To select a cell, click the button in the text field. This will minimize the conditional formatting box. \n After selecting “Formula Is," all the drop-downs disappear and you are left with a text field. This means you can type in any formula you want using Excel’s formulas. For the most part, you want to stick to simple formulas and avoid text or text strings. Keep in mind that the formula is based on the current cell. For an example, think like this: C5 (current cell) = B5>=B6. This means that C5 will change formatting when B5 is greater than or equal to B6. This example can actually be used in “Cell Value Is," but you get the idea. To select a cell in the worksheet, click the button in the text field. This will minimize the conditional formatting box. \n For example: Imagine you have a spreadsheet with all the days of the current month listed down in Column A; you need to enter data in this worksheet everyday; and you would like the entire row associated with today's date to light up in some way. Try this: (1) Highlight your entire table of data, (2) Select conditional formatting as explained above, (3) Select "Formula Is" and (4) Enter something like =$A3=TODAY() where Column A contains your dates and Row 3 is your first row of data (after your headings). Note that you want the dollar sign in front of the A but not in front of the 3. (5) Select your formats. , You will notice that it automatically places dollar signs ($) before the row and column designations. This makes that cell reference non-transferable. This means if you were to apply the same conditional formatting to other cells through copy/paste, they will all reference the original cell. To turn this off, simply click in the text field and delete the dollar signs. If you do not want to set a condition using a cell in your sheet, simply type the value into the text field. You can even enter text, depending on the arguments. For example, don’t use “greater than" as the argument and “John Smith" in the text field. You can’t be greater than John Smith...well, you could, but - oh, never mind. In this example, the whole condition, if you were going to say it out loud, would read something like this: “When this cell’s value is greater than the value in cell B5, then..." \n Keep in mind that you want to offset the cell from the rest of the sheet, especially if you have lots of data. But you also want to make it look professional. For this example, we want the font to become bold and white and the shading to become red. To begin, click “Format..." \n Then click “Border" and make any changes there. This example does not make border changes. Then click “Patterns" and make changes there. At whatever point you are finished making the formatting changes, click "OK." \n Make changes as needed until the formatting appears the way you would like. \n You will notice in the example that the second condition also includes a small formula (=B5*.90). This takes the value of B5, multiplies it by 0.9 (aka 90 percent) and applies formatting if the value is less than that. \n One of two things will happen: \n No changes will appear. This means that the conditions are not met, so no formatting was applied. \n One of the formats you selected appears because one of the conditions has been met. \n 
 Make certain to catch the three springs. Hold the mechanism together as it slides off the bar. Remove the trigger and the spring under it, too. You must have all of the following parts available to make the clamp work when it is reassembled: \n The bar and two plastic retainer pins––save the pins for later. (See Tips below if these are missing.) \n The end pad––save for later. \n The plastic mechanism case. \n The plastic ratchet handle. \n The "flat" coil spring––this is about 2 inches long. \n The leaf spring––this is about 4 inches long, flat, with and oblong hole and a bend. \n A flat steel ratchet plate. \n A steel ratchet plate with a hook on the end. \n The steel release trigger. \n The V-shaped trigger spring.\n With the ratchet groves facing away from you, fit the plastic mechanism case over the end of the bar and slide it on, going through the hole in the end opposite the pad, through the U-shaped guide inside, and then through the trigger hole in the pad-end. If it does not slide easily, flip the bar upside down and try the other end., The ratchet groves must face the inside of the case. Let the case rock back to reveal the end of the bar. \n  Either end can go down., With the pin end of the handle up, and the hook pointing up, slide the plate into the second hole in the handle such that the plate sits nearly flat against the handle end.  The hook must catch on the pin such that the hook folds over the pin and points to that end of the handle. If it points toward the open U-shaped end of the handle, it will not work. \n Thread the hook-end ratchet plate and handle over the exposed end of the bar, placing your index finger on the hook to keep the plate flat to the handle end.  \n Slide the handle down to the flat ratchet plate. \n \n   \n The first trick is to make sure the end of the bar is even with the handle opening.  \n The second trick is to grab the handle with your hand, sliding your finger under the leaf spring with your thumb on top of the ratchet hook.  \n Squeeze to compress the flat coil spring against the ratchet plates and handle end.  \n Then slide into the space in the mechanism cover between the U-shaped guide and the trigger end.  \n Push it in so that the end of the bar is visible through the trigger opening. \n \n   \n Place the two free legs of the trigger spring down into the cup around the trigger opening, then place the unhooked end of the trigger into the notch in the mechanism cover with the trigger hook pointing up.  \n Depress the trigger slightly and slide it over the end of the bar and the entire assembly down on the bar 6 inches. \n Check that it moves the mechanism up on the bar and that the trigger must be squeezed to move the mechanism down on the bar.,
 Sprint drills are an easy way to accomplish this. \n Run at top speed for 20-30 meters. \n Make sure that your arm action is smooth and relaxed during the exercise. Keep your arms close to your body.Focus on making smooth, even strides, with your knees high. \n Keep your head relaxed and in a natural position. \n Slow jog or walk back to your starting point when finished with the sprint. \n Do 2-4 repetitions of this drill.\n Acceleration drills will make you build up to and come down from high speeds more efficiently. This type of exercise also helps you work high speeds into other routines. To do a simple acceleration drill: \n Jog for 10 yards. \n Sprint for 10 yards. \n Shift back to jogging for 10 more yards. \n Shift back to sprinting for 10 more yards. \n Breakdown in 5 yards. \n Walk back to your starting point. \n This horizontal tool requires you to alternate your feet across successive rungs as you run. To improve your speed, train with the ladder while using a stopwatch, and work on improving your best time. \n Speed ladders are available at many athletic supply stores. \n To accomplish this, do 30 minutes of interval training. Alternate light jogging (5-10 min) with short bursts of more powerful exercises, such as: \n Sprints \n Running stairs or hills \n Ladder drills \n Using a ball in combination with any of the above \n To improve your reaction speed, practice while a coach or friend calls (or better, uses a visual signal) for you to change your exercise. Respond as quickly as possible. Try incorporating a combination of exercises like: \n Changing direction rapidly when running \n Sprinting on command \n Playing “Red Light Green Light” \n To accelerate, you will have to extend and use your hip, knees, and ankles.When running or doing other exercises, focus on making long, even strides that stretch out. Increasing your stride length and muscle output in this way will boost your speed. \n While training to increase your speed at moving across the field, do not neglect your control of the ball. Remember that soccer is primarily a sport where the player’s lower body moves in contact with the ground and ball. To be not only fast, but fast and in control of the ball, you must work on your agility. \n Dribble at every opportunity, using all parts of your foot (outside, inside, top, and bottom).Do speed dribbling exercises by kicking the ball slightly forward and running after it. \n Practice changing direction quickly while dribbling and doing speed dribbling exercises. You can also do this while attempting to evade another player in order to practice using quick dribbles as a way to beat opponents. \n Do lateral ball drop exercises. Have a coach or partner hold a ball at shoulder height, 5 meters away from you. When your coach/partner drops the ball, attempt to reach and control the ball before it bounces a second time. \n Always do stretches and short exercises to warm up before beginning a speed training session.This will prepare your mind and body. If you do not properly warm up, you risk injuring yourself. \n Since it utilizes great power and force, you should do speed exercises while you are still fresh. Otherwise, you might not be able to reach and push your speed potential. \n In addition to exercises that aim to improve your time, try doing plyometric (explosive) exercises and weight training, such as: \n Jumps \n Squats \n Burpees \n Bench press \n Lifts \n Leg curls \n It is very important that you take a day to rest between practice sessions. If you try to train for speed while you are sore or fatigued, you will be unsuccessful and risk injuring yourself. \n Make sure that you have a fundamental knowledge of and good practice with soccer skills before attempting to increase your speed. Focus on doing things the right way, then on becoming faster at them. \n

 Tobacco is an extremely hardy plant. It grows pretty much where any other agricultural crop will grow, although, as a rule of thumb, tobacco grows better in soils which drain well. The important thing to note is that tobacco will be extremely affected by the soil in which it is grown; lighter soils will generally produce lighter colored tobacco, while darker soils will generally produce darker colored tobacco.\n Tobacco requires a frost-free period of 3 to 4 months between transplant and harvest.For best results, tobacco should be ripened without heavy rainfall; excess water causes tobacco plants to become thin and flaky. The ideal temperature for growing tobacco is 68° to 86° F (20° to 30° C). \n Be sure you place your starting mix in a small flower pot, preferably with holes in the bottom. These seeds should be grown indoors for 4-6 weeks.Seed starting mix consists of compost and other nutrients which promote healthy seed growth. They are available at most gardening and home improvement stores. \n Tobacco seeds are extremely small (not much larger than a pin prick), so be sure not to sow them too thickly. Allow adequate spacing between seeds to avoid overcrowding. \n Because tobacco seeds are so small, it's not advisable to begin them outdoors. Also, their nutrient requirements are different from many other plants, so adding a bit of gravel or special fertilizer designed for tobacco is a good idea. \n Tobacco seeds require warm temperatures ranging from 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit to properly germinate. If you aren't growing in a greenhouse, make sure your indoor area meets these temperature requirements. \n Do not cover the seeds with soil since they need light for germination; covering can slow down and even prevent germination from taking place. Seeds should begin to germinate in 7-10 days., The soil should never be allowed to completely dry out. \n Be extra careful when watering because the force of the water can uproot the freshly emerging tobacco seedlings and cause them to die.If possible, water the seedlings from the bottom. If you used a flower pot with holes in the bottom, set the pot on top of a tray of water. Leave it there for a few seconds so that the water is absorbed by the soil. This will water the seedling without wetting the leaves. \n Your seedlings should be large enough for transplantation if you watered and stored them correctly. \n Transplanting seedlings to a larger container will allow them to grow a strong and healthy root system. \n To see if your seedlings are the right size, try grasping them. If you can easily pinch them between your thumb and index finger, they are ready for transplanting. If they are still too small, allow the germination process to continue until they have reached the right size. \n Transplanting tobacco plants bare-root (without soil) directly from the seedling pot to the garden is an easier method, as it only involves one transplantation. However, once planted, the bare-rooted plant can go into "transplant shock" where some or most of its largest leaves turn yellow and wilt. After a week, the tobacco plant will begin to flourish once more, but avoiding transplant shock altogether will save you a week of waiting as the potted plant will begin growing immediately once transplanted. \n This should be sufficient food for the plants until they are ready to be transferred to your garden in approximately 3-4 weeks. \n If your plant begins to look yellow or look stunted, another dose of fertilizer may be needed. Do so sparingly, however, since over-fertilization while in pots may burn the plants roots or lead to overgrown, spindly plants., Be sure the area you plant the tobacco is constantly exposed to sun, well-drained, and tilled. \n Lack of sun will result in spindly plants, poor growth, and thin leaves. This may not be problematic if you intend on planting tobacco for cigar wrapper use, since growing tobacco under shade can create desirable leaf characteristics.Also test the pH levels of your garden. Tobacco plants need to be planted in moderately acidic soil, otherwise they won't flourish. The soil itself should have a pH of 5.8. Poor growth and some growth disorders may occur if the soil pH is 6.5 or higher.Avoid preparing your garden on soil that is infested with diseases and nematodes. Nematodes are parasitic worms which feed on tobacco and are extremely difficult to exterminate once infestation occurs. \n Space the plants at least 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) apart in a row, and space rows 3 1/2 - 4 feet from each other. \n Tobacco plants are "heavy feeders," meaning they will deplete the nutrients in the soil in about 2 years. To counteract this, employ a 2 year rotation in your growing space by planting for 2 years in a different location and waiting 1 year before transferring it back to its original location.Rather than having an empty garden plot, you could rotate tobacco with plants that are not susceptible to common soil-borne pests, like corn or soybeans., Once they become better established, you can water less frequently to avoid over-watering. \n Keep the plants well watered without making the soil soggy. If your garden area may experience drought, consider installing an irrigation system. This will prevent the soil from becoming excessively dry, which can then hinder tobacco growth.If you expect a few days of light drizzles or rain, you can water even less frequently. The structure of the tobacco plant's leaves enables the plant to collect and funnel the water down to the base of the plant., Fertilizers used for tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes are also suitable.Over-fertilizing is a serious concern, as it can cause damaging salt accumulation. The application amount will depend largely on the grade of the fertilizer, the natural fertility of the soil, losses of nutrients due to leaching, and other subjective factors. Consult your fertilizer's directions for the most optimal usage. \n It is recommended that you apply the fertilizer several times. Once the tobacco begins to flower, there should be no need to fertilize further. \n Topping is the removal of the terminal (center) bud and allows the upper leaves to get larger and thicker than if they were untopped.The terminal bud is the most prominent and is typically located at the very top of the stem.The top can be removed by simply breaking or cutting it off, preferably before any flowers open. \n Soon after the top is removed, axillary buds or suckers will develop at each leaf. Remove these by hand as well, otherwise they will reduce the tobacco's yield and quality. \n You can also pull up soil around the base of the plant to help strengthen it.Tobacco roots grow quickly and the root structure is quite large, with thousands of small hair-like feeder roots that grow close to the soil surface. Be careful when tilling or hoeing, as penetrating the soil too deep can damage the roots. \n After 3-4 weeks from planting, heavy tilling should be stopped and only light scrapings to control weeds should be done. \n Common tobacco pests include budworms, hornworms, and pathogens. \n Tobacco is subject to infestation by many different bugs and diseases. The rotation process should help reduce the likelihood of infestation, but it is no guarantee. \n If you still find your tobacco to be infested, many gardening and home improvement stores sell tobacco-specific pesticides. Brand names include "Nemacor," "Prowl," and "Admire." Keep in mind that some pesticides are specifically geared towards insect control on young plants, while others just kill fungus. Find a pesticide which is most suitable to your situation. \n Alternatively, you can remove the leaves from the stalk in the field. Your plants should be ready for harvest about 3 months after planting. \n Stalks should be cut about 3-4 weeks after topping. The lower leaves will be partially deteriorated at this time. If you remove the leaves in the field, there should be 4 or 5 harvests at intervals of 1-2 weeks, starting with the lower leaves. The first harvest should start soon after topping and when the leaves show a slight yellowing. \n Flowers will inhibit the growth of your leaves and will compete for sunlight; removing them is important for obtaining the broadest tobacco leaves possible. \n You will need to keep the leaves intact because they will be hanged during the curing process. Curing is necessary because it prepares the leaves for consumption; the process produces various compounds in the leaf which give cured tobacco its hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavor. Curing also contributes to the tobacco's "smoothness" when consumed. \n The suggested temperature for curing ranges from 65 degrees to 95 degrees Fahrenheit, while the most optimal humidity ranges from 65-70 percent.Be sure to provide adequate space between the stalks to allow for satisfactory drying of the leaves. \n Proper curing should take a few weeks in order to achieve good quality. Tobacco that cures too fast will be green and will likely not have good aroma or flavor. Leaves that cure too slow may develop mold or rot. Be sure to monitor your tobacco leaves closely for these signs and adjust your temperature/humidity accordingly. \n If curing leaves on the stalk, remove the leaves from the stalk once curing has completed. \n A building that can be opened and closed as needed to control the humidity and drying rate is ideal. Some producers of homegrown tobacco have built curing facilities and may offer them for sale.Air curing tobacco is primarily reserved for cigar use. Tobacco can also be cured using fire, the sun, or can be flue-cured. Fire-cured tobacco typically takes between 10-13 weeks and is used to make pipe tobacco and chewing tobacco. Sun-cured and flue-cured tobacco is used in cigarettes. \n Commercial tobacco is typically aged for a year or more, but aging your own tobacco can take up to 5-6 years. \n Aging will not occur if the temperature and moisture content is perfect. If the tobacco is too dry, it will not age; if it is too moist, it will rot. Unfortunately, the proper temperature and humidity vary widely and will require some experimentation on your part. \n Monitor your leaves closely during the aging process to ensure that they remain moist, yet rot free. Aging is not an exact science and will require impromptu adjustments when necessary.Aging your tobacco leaves is optional, but know that un-aged tobacco is often harsh and lacks good flavor. \n 
 Maybe there is something you need to ask a friend, or homework you need to do? Note them down on something you carry around a lot, like your mobile phone.\n Use a nice scented shampoo and conditioner. \n It will calm down your brain so that you'll get to sleep easier and faster. \n Health experts recommend 8-9 hours for teenagers. For example, try going to bed at 10-10:30pm and waking up at 7:00 \n If you can, choose a picture for the alarm that makes you smile, such as a funny picture of you and your friends. Give the alarm a name that is positive such as "You Rock!" or "You are Gorgeous!" as opposed to "Get Up." \n Who wants to get ready in the dark? Also, do not open your blinds that much, because people can see you getting dressed, depending where you live. \n You don't even have to wash your hair, since you did it last night, which means you don't have to go to school with wet hair or have to spend a bunch of time blow-drying it! \n Make sure to pick out an outfit that you like and feel comfortable in, because not having to worry about your outfit will make your day that much better. Wear your school uniform correctly if you have to. \n Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, after all. Lots of girls skip breakfast, which is horrible! Without breakfast, your brain doesn't have enough energy to function, so you won't be able to concentrate on your schoolwork, which will make you feel flustered and stressed. You can avoid all of those negative emotions by simply eating some cereal and an apple! \n such as concealer or powder. Note that you don't need makeup to help you have a great day. If you feel confident without it, don't wear it! If you don't know how to apply makeup properly or you're too rushed in the morning and it looks sloppy, don't wear it! If your parents don't want you to wear makeup, don't wear it! Chances are, if you're in one of the 3 situations above, you'll feel better without makeup on anyway! \n You'll make them feel good about themselves, and you'll most likely get a few compliments back. Karma does good things sometimes! \n They will make you and other people feel great. \n Just try to feel confident, and remember that people are attracted to confidence. Chill and enjoy the day! \n Smiling and laughing reduces stress, as well as makes you healthier and releases endorphins that make you feel better! So laugh as much as you can, and don't forget to smile! \n Then simply start reading and the time flies by so quick you barely notice! \n 
 Males' plumage is copper and gold and they have red faces and long tails. Females are brown and harder to spot. They are the size of large chickens.It is often illegal to hunt females. \n Pheasants have very good hearing and eyesight.\n Depending on where you live, you will be subject to various regulations and licensing requirements. \n You may need to tag and record your hunts. \n You may be required to wear orange. \n Some locations require hunting education. \n Be aware of your locality’s rules regarding age, as well as load and firearms., While hunting pheasant without a dog is possible, it will be much easier with a dog to track and locate birds for you. \n Labradors are good at tracking and flushing pheasant out of heavy cover. They are popular options. \n Pointers are good for finding birds in light cover and notifying owners., There are a variety of options, and you will want to keep in mind not only your target, but long hours of walking and carrying the gun. \n Stick with a gun that weighs less than 8 pounds. \n A 12-gauge shotgun is always popular for hunting pheasants, although 16- or 20-gauge are possibilities. \n Double-action shotguns are most common, although some hunters prefer semi-automatics. \n Lead shot is often banned on public lands, so you’ll need steel. Pheasant hunting requires a heavy shot, like size 4. \n It's likely to be wet and cold, and you'll be doing a lot of walking on uneven terrain., It’s usually in the late fall through the early winter, but the specific dates can change based on where you live. \n The best pheasant hunting in the U.S. is in the Midwest and Plains states like Iowa or South Dakota, although pheasants can be found in other parts of the country., You can't just hunt anywhere.Public grounds often provide good hunting during cold weather or later in the season, but you will be competing with many other hunters, as well as their car doors and noisy friends possibly scaring off the birds. \n Public grounds can be more challenging, and more dangerous since there will be less control over who is there and what they are doing. \n Arrive early, and try to find less popular spots. \n Dogs can smell better in cold, wet environments. It’s also easier to track pheasants in mud and snow., The birds are out looking for food in lighter cover at those times and are more easily located. \n \n If the weather has been dry, the birds will gather near water. \n They offer several benefits, including guides. \n They often begin earlier than hunting season on public lands, so you can practice with your dog. This is particularly useful for young dogs who need more training. \n You will have the opportunity to get comfortable with your gun, and you can practice shooting clay pigeons, which requires shooting ahead of your target. \n Clubs offer a variety of cover to experience. \n Clubs release the birds throughout the day and you can request varying degrees of difficulty., Your dog will be especially helpful you are alone, so be sure to hunt into the wind.Drive around a strip of cover and position downwind. \n Move toward an open area or an obstruction to slow the birds.Rises and ravines are also good positions because you have cover, and birds are obstructed.\n Groups can cover much more ground. \n The social aspect of group hunting is an attraction for many hunters. \n Be meticulous. If you are in a group, coordinate your patterns. \n Pause frequently to confuse the birds and make them nervous. \n Be very quiet at all times. Use hand signals to other hunters rather than shouting to each other. From the time you arrive on the grounds, to the moment you leave, be very quiet. \n Be patient. \n When your dog stops and points or quivers, get close to him quickly and quietly. \n If you a using a flushing dog, such as a Lab, the dog will flush out the rooster. \n A pointing dog, such as German Short-haired Pointers, will point to the bird, allowing you to do the flushing. \n \n Pheasants have three toes pointing forward, with the middle often being longer.Tracks are more easily visible in mud or snow. \n Pheasants like corn, so look for corn patches. They are attracted to the green and shade. \n Pheasants also like thick cattails and marshy areas. \n Make your shot only after the bird is above human height. You will have about a two second opportunity, so you need to be very quick. \n If you hit the bird and killed it, good job! Most dogs will retrieve the bird for you, or you can get it yourself. \n Dress and cool the meat as soon as possible to avoid spoilage. \n If you did not hit the bird, just try again next time! \n A dirty gun could misfire or malfunction.\n Always be aware of where your muzzle is pointing. \n Disengage the safety as you approach the point. \n Your reaction time will improve with practice. Don't risk unintentionally firing. \n Know what you are pointing at, but also what is behind it., You may not be required by your state, but wearing bright colors could save your life. \n If everyone walks shoulder-to-shoulder, there is much less of a chance of accidentally firing on each other., Birdshot can spray out, and could hit a dog or person. \n Do not aim at water. \n Drugs or alcohol will impair your judgment and reaction time. \n Hunting is a cherished hobby for many families. But aware of your state's age restrictions before setting out. \n Consider weather conditions when taking a child hunting. \n Always emphasize safety when teaching a child to hunt.\n Choose your location carefully. Get permission beforehand if necessary. \n 
\n When the "Pages" dialogue box appears, you should see all your pages that comprise your document. \n The first page in your list may be the cover, which often does not have a page number. \n You can also zoom onto the lower right corner if you are using a right page as your first numbered page. Most people start numbering in the lower left hand corner. \n It is an uppercase "T" on your left panel. \n \n You must make the box very wide. InDesign will automatically update page numbers when you are through and it requires that the box could fit the number 1,999, even if your page numbers will remain low. \n A menu will appear to the right of "Insert Special Character." Scroll down to "Markers." Unlike symbols, markers can change depending upon the length or other changes to the document. In the menu that appears to the right of "Markers," choose "Current Page Number." \n The shortcut on a Mac operating systems (OS) is to press "Command," "Shift," "Option" and the letter "N" at the same time. You should use this if you will be using this command a lot. \n The short cut on Windows OS is to press "Control," "Shift," "Alt" and the letter "N" at the same time. \n Your first number will appear as an "A" with a number sign next to it because it is the master page. The other page numbers will appear as numbers. \n When you change the style on the master page "A," it will change all the numbers' styles. \n This will save you time in creating the page numbers on the right side of the pages, instead of going through the whole process again. \n Zoom in on the left and the right. They should appear in order. \n 
 For this recipe you will need the following items: Paring knife \n Zester \n Saucepan \n Candy thermometer \n Candy molds \n Airtight storage container.\n Start by peeling the ginger with a paring knife or vegetable peeler. Fresh ginger is available at most supermarkets in the produce section. \n Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and is commonly used in cough remedies as an effective antihistamine and chest decongestant.Cut the ginger into very thin slices using a paring knife. \n Use a zester to get at least 1 teaspoon of lemon zest. \n Bring this to a boil over high heat.You will know when the pot is at a full boil when you have a constant stream of large bubbles coming to the surface and a good deal of steam. \n Once the pot has come to a full boil, reduce the heat to low. \n Then remove the ginger and cinnamon stick. The easiest way to remove the spices is with a strainer. \n Place a strainer into a clean saucepan. \n Pour the hot mixture through the strainer. \n The ginger and cinnamon will be left in the strainer and the liquid will be caught in the clean saucepan underneath. \n Bring this mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Honey has been studied in clinical trials. It has been proven to be as effective as cough syrup in suppressing coughs. You will want the sugar to dissolve. \n You can tell if the sugar is dissolved if you take a spoon of the liquid and cannot see any grains of sugar in it. \n Once the sugar is dissolved, you will use a candy thermometer to get this syrup to the hard-crack candy stage. \n You will use this to monitor the heat.The candy liquid will need to be heated to a high temperature in order to harden into lozenges. \n It is very important that you closely watch the temperature of the syrup so it doesn't burn onto the saucepan or become too hot to form hard cough drops. \n The goal temperature for hard-crack lozenges is 300-305 degrees Fahrenheit. \n It will rise quickly as you cook the liquid.As the liquid rises in temperature, it may darken. This is expected as the sugar in the syrup caramelizes. \n When the candy thermometer reaches 300-305 degrees, remove the liquid from heat. \n You will now add the final ingredients before pouring the mixture to cool in candy molds. \n \n As you add the juice, it may cause the hot liquid to splash. \n Stir completely to make sure the liquid is evenly mixed. \n You can use unflavored cooking spray to do so. Carefully pour the hot liquid into the molds. \n Take care to fill only the small candy mold and not to spill too much of the liquid over the top each. \n This recipe will make about 50 small lozenge sized pieces. \n This will take an hour or more.When the cough drops are cool, crack them out of the molds onto wax paper. \n To crack the drops out of the candy molds, tap the mold gently on a hard surface. The cough drops should fall out. \n You may have to bend the candy mold tray in order to get the cough drops out, similar to cracking ice. \n If you don't have superfine sugar at home, you can put regular granulated sugar in a food processor or blender. Process this until it is a finer consistency.Shake the jar to coat the cough drops with sugar. \n This will prevent them from sticking together. \n You can also use powdered sugar to coat the drops, but it tends to clump. \n You don't need to refrigerate them.Use them as needed. \n Since these don't contain any of the common drugs found in cough syrups, these are ideal if you want to avoid the side effects of over-the-counter cough remedies. \n The cough drops will have a pleasant, sweet taste of lemon, ginger, and cinnamon. \n There are several suggestions for herbal medicines that are effective at treating coughs and colds. Elderberry and elderflower has been used to relieve congestion. Slippery elm has been traditionally used by Native Americans to treat coughs and gastrointestinal conditions.Chamomile may be an effective treatment for coughs as it can help to reduce inflammation and mucus production.To make a strong tea, place a generous pinch of each herb into a cup of water in a saucepan. \n Heat the water and herbs to a simmer on high heat, then cover and reduce the heat. \n Let the tea steep for 15 to 20 minutes over the lowest heat. \n Strain out the herbs and reserve 1/2 cup of the tea for the cough drops. \n You can make DIY molds rather than using candy molds to make cough drops using sugar and a baking sheet.In a 9 x 13 pan or any cookie sheet, add a few cups of powdered sugar. \n Use your finger or a measuring spoon to make indentations in the sugar. \n This is where you will pour the syrup for your cough lozenges. \n Start by putting the 1/2 cup of herbal tea from Step 1 into a saucepan, then add 1.5 cups of honey and 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract.Use a medium to medium-high heat to heat up the ingredients. \n Stir constantly to make sure all the ingredients are mixed. \n Clip a candy thermometer on the side of the pan to monitor the temperature. \n You will want it to get to about 300 °F (149 °C). This will allow the liquid to harden into lozenges as it cools.The mixture may get slightly foamy as it heats up. \n If this occurs, give the cough drop liquid a stir. \n You will be able to tell once the mixture gets near to the correct temperature as it will thicken. \n This process generally takes about 30 minutes. \n Once the liquid is at a temperature of 300 degrees, remove it from the heat. \n Pour slowly and carefully.Pour the hot liquid into each of the small depressions in the powdered sugar on the baking sheet you prepared earlier. \n Alternatively, you can use a greased candy mold. \n If you don't have a candy mold or don't want to use sugar, you can pour the liquid onto a piece of greased parchment paper. Be aware that this is the messiest way to do this. \n Try not to disturb the cough drops as they cool.Once the drops have cooled, carefully move them out of their sugar molds. If using candy molds, crack the cough drops out of the molds. \n Coat the cough drops in powdered sugar. \n You can store these in single layers between wax paper in the refrigerator for about 3 weeks. \n You can also freeze them between layers of wax paper. If you choose to do so, they will last for several months. \n This recipe calls for slippery elm powder, cinnamon, honey, orange essential oil and lemon essential oil.You can buy slippery elm bark and the essential oils from most health food stores, herbal shops, or online herbal retailers such as Mountain Rose Herbs. \n Slippery elm contains a substance called mucilage. This becomes gel-like when combined with water or honey. This can help coat the mouth, throat, and digestive tract.Native Americans used this herbal remedy for centuries to calm coughs and gastrointestinal problems.Slippery elm has not been shown to cause any medical complications, unlike other herbal supplements. Little formal research has been conducted to show how effective it is at treating medical conditions. Remember that clinical studies have shown that honey is a very effective treatment for coughs. Cinnamon may also have some effectiveness at controlling a bad cough., Stir very thoroughly to combine.If the honey is too stiff has crystallized, try warming up the jar under warm water. \n This should thin the honey or reconstitute it. \n Sometimes this mixture is very dry and crumbly. If this is the case, you can add two more tablespoons of honey to make it easier to work with. \n When finished the mixture should resemble a soft dough. It may be sticky because of the honey. \n Use a dropper to make sure you get the right amount of drops for each.You will need 10 drops of orange essential oil and 6 drops of lemon essential oil. \n Mix these into the cough lozenge mixture thoroughly. \n You want to make sure they are incorporated evenly into the dough. \n These should be roughly the size of a teaspoon.Place these on a sheet of wax paper or parchment. \n You can lay this on a counter or a baking sheet. \n Place the lozenges in an area where they won't be disturbed. \n These cough lozenges may not be very attractive but they contain effective ingredients. \n You may need to leave them longer if you live in a humid climate.To store the lozenges, wrap them in wax paper. \n Alternatively, you can store them in an airtight jar. \n These will last approximately 3 weeks when stored properly. \n The recipe should make about 36 lozenges. \n 
 If a new player asks how to play Mao, you have to tell them it's a frustrating card game and that you can't tell them the rules; they have to find out the specifics themselves. There is no limit to the number of players in a game, but you'll want a deck for every 4 to 5 players, maybe more if you have new players or complicated rules and are likely to need a lot of penalty cards. \n He or she has the authority to initiate the game, choose what rules to use, judge and resolve disputes, and deal with any unusual complications that might arise. \n Since the dealer may be the only player who knows all the rules from the beginning of the game, it is critical that he or she enforces them consistently and fairly. \n Some groups prefer to have a second player who also knows the rules so that the two of them can call penalties on each other. \n 5 to 8 cards per player is typical, but the exact amount doesn't matter as long as everyone gets the same number. Place the remainder of the deck in the center of the playing area to be used as a stock of penalty cards, then flip one card over and place it next to the deck to start. \n They vary with every game. Look below for guidelines to figuring out rules for each particular game of Mao. \n In fact, no talking at all except when required by another rule, to call a point of order, or when in the middle of a point of order.\n Counterintuitive as this seems, you have to do it when mandated or else you'll receive another penalty card. \n The game is similar to Uno in this respect, because you have to alert all the other players that you're close to winning, and if you don't you can be penalized. \n Additionally, no playing out of turn or trying to call a penalty on another player if that player hasn't broken any rules--if you're going to disrupt the game, it's better not to play at all. If a player unintentionally inflicts a penalty on another player because they themselves do not fully understand the rules, any other player except the one penalized can inflict a penalty card on the first player for "inflicting an incorrect penalty". \n They will then end their turn by adding this card to their hand. \n A point of order occurs when the game comes to a halt so the players can confer and discuss to clarify certain things about the game, although they still cannot talk about the rules directly. Points of order are an important part of the Mao process, and come with their own rules, which are: \n Do not refer to the point of order directly by name (you can get around this by calling it "P of O", for example, or simply "point order", eliminating the "of") \n Players must not look at their cards during a Point of order. If they are still holding their cards after someone calls a Point of order, they can be penalized. \n The point of order ends when someone calls "point of disorder", "point taken", or even just "pick up your cards" \n In some variations, only the dealer can start and end points of order; however, you can allow anyone to do so in your game \n In another variation, point of order must be said before and after you speak during play. Players who do not do so will be penalized for "speaking out of turn." \n \n Requiring a player to draw penalty cards \n Changing which cards can be legally played to the discard pile \n Requiring a player to make a choice (such as specifying the value of a wild card). \n It's up to you! \n Musical Chairs. A Four of Clubs forces everyone to get up from the table, run around once and sit back down in their original spot. The last player to make it back to their spot draws a penalty card. \n Deuces. A Two requires everyone to touch their middle and index fingers to the table. The last player to do so draws a penalty card. \n Have a Nice Day. A seven requires the next player to draw a penalty card. Sevens can add up, requiring players to draw 2, 3, 4, etc. penalty cards when multiple 7's are played in a row. Whoever plays it must say "Have a (Very) (Very, Very) (etc.) Nice Day. \n Royalty. A King requires a player to say "All Hail the King (of spades)". A Queen requires the player to say "Neeumph" (Queen of Spades). \n Manners. A person must say "Thank You" when dealt a penalty card. \n Soap. Any cursing results in a penalty card. \n Holiday. A six requires a player to say "Merry Christmas". \n Jacks. A Jack allows a player to change suits (wild card). \n Spades. Spade cards must be named when played. \n Aces. Aces cause the next player to skip their turn. \n Reverse. An eight causes the turn order to reverse. \n Rhyme Fest. A nine causes the person who played it to say a word and all other players must say a rhyming word in turn without stating a previously said word. If a player says a non-rhyming word, takes too long to say a rhyming word, or says a previously stated word, he draws a penalty card. \n Chauncey. If two identical cards are played in succession, everyone must say "Chauncey". The last player to do so draws a penalty card. \n Diamonds. If any card with a suit of a diamond is played, the person who played it must say "Shine bright like a diamond". \n Change of Suit. If a person plays a card with a different suit, but the same letter or number as the previous card played (Thus changing the suit), then the person who played the card that would be changing the suit must knock once on the surface of which the game is being played on (Such as a table). \n 
 These challenges vary widely from individual to individual, because they are directly related to the specific areas of your brain that are affected by the condition.\n Most people have a blend to the two challenges (called "expressive" and "receptive" language skills), with one being more of a problematic than the other (however, which one is more burdensome could change as the condition progresses). \n Depending upon the type of language challenge you are faced with, some people find it helpful to learn alternate modes of communication such as gesturing and/or pointing. \n The mainstay of treatment is to focus on the strengths you have (i.e. the skills you have preserved) when it comes to language and communication, and to adapt your form of communication to rely as much as possible on your strengths, while avoiding your weaknesses. This is because your weaknesses will likely only continue to deteriorate with time, given that they signify the area with brain damage.Unfortunately, sign language does not work as an alternative mode of communication for people with progressive aphasia, as it relies on the same areas of the brain that are already damaged due to the disease.Using apps on an iPhone or an iPad that can speak for a person may be of help. \n Having family members and friends communicate simply and clearly can also aid with comprehension. \n All she can do is help you to develop strategies to manage your condition most effectively, and to preserve your language and communication abilities for as long as possible by working with you on adaptive techniques. \n It is important to know that the condition cannot be cured, so as not to have unrealistically high expectations of the therapist you are working with. \n Not only does it aid in not feeling alone, but you may also pick up valuable tips and strategies by seeing how others have coped with their illness. \n Check to see if there is an Aphasia Community Group in your area. \n To avoid the confusion of others not understanding your difficulties, some people find it helpful to carry printed information about their illness and to bring it with them to public or social situations. \n You may wish to carry an ID card with you, if introducing yourself clearly and coherently is a problem. \n You may also wish to carry a small amount of printed information detailing your condition and explaining how it is best for people to interact with you, as this can help to smooth your ability to fit in socially. \n Because progressive aphasia is a condition that is usually mild at the start, and progresses at a slow rate, many people can continue working for several years even after being diagnosed with the condition. You may wish to let your boss know that you have the condition, and/or to ask for modified duties should you find that it is interfering with your ability to effectively communicate (either in written or spoken language) in your current job. \n You may also wish to look into whether you have any employee insurance or other health care coverage that can help with medical appointments, and/or with paid time off work. \n In progressive aphasia, you will have only language and communication deficits on exam. You will have no other mental challenges, such as problems with your memory, with your physical ability to perform day-to-day tasks, or with any of your other thinking processes. \n Your doctor can run through a series of cognitive tests with you to rule out other common conditions, such as Alzheimer's dementia. \n Your doctor will be able to rule out other conditions such as a stroke or a traumatic brain injury by performing a neurological exam, as well as by offering you a head CT or MRI which can give further insight into any anatomical or structural problems. \n Progressive aphasia will show shrinkage of certain brain tissues (related to the language functions) on CT scan. \n However, the appearance of progressive aphasia can be differentiated on imaging from a stroke or a traumatic brain injury. \n Progressive aphasia occurs when brain cells in the areas related to language malfunction and die. It is usually caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). (It is important to note that Alzheimer’s disease is not the same as Alzheimer's dementia.)FTLD occurs when parts of the brain atrophy or shrink,and AD is caused by microscopic abnormalities in the brain.When FTLD and AD occur in the areas of brain that control speech and language, the person develops progressive aphasia.Progressive aphasia is caused by FTLD in 60–70% of cases and AD in 30–40%. Whether progressive aphasia is caused by FTLD or AD can only be determined by autopsy.In most cases, progressive aphasia is not genetic.Remember that progressive aphasia is not the same as Alzheimer's dementia — while language skills degenerate, the person should be completely functional otherwise. A person with progressive aphasia usually can continue taking care of himself and pursue hobbies and interests.A person with Alzheimer's dementia will experience a progressive loss of all cognitive function, not just speech.Progressive aphasia is also not caused by brain trauma, stroke, tumor, or infection., This condition is one that is not curable, and can only be managed as best as possible as it continues to progress gradually with time. (This is another feature that differentiates it from a stroke or a traumatic brain injury, as both of these can show improvements with time and a slow regaining of function, rather than a continual deterioration.) \n When you understand that the goal is to effectively manage the condition, rather than to cure it, it can help you to go into your doctor's and therapist's appointments with realistic expectations in terms of what they can do for you. \n 
 If they are extremely tight, spray some lubricant on the nuts - a silicone lubricant or even vegetable oil will do the trick very well. (Many modern bikes will not have nuts. They have a quick-release which you can easily loosen and remove the wheel). \n \n Every brake setup is a little different but you should likely be able to slip the brake cable out of a socket on the brake arms to release them. Some brakes may require that you loosen the cable from a clamped position. \n If it's the rear wheel, you will need to lift the chain clear of the gear cluster. To ease the removal of a rear wheel, shift the chain to the smallest gear on the wheel before loosening the skewer or nuts. If it's the front wheel, it will be easier. \n With a presta valve you need to unscrew the top part of the stem to release the air in the tube. During this step you'll also want to remove the lock ring that screws onto the stem and sits flush on the rim if your bike has one. \n With all the air out of the tube squeeze the tire together and you'll see the tire release from the inside of the rim, this will help when removing the tire. \n You can use the handle of a spoon or similar object if you don't have tire levers but be very careful, as you risk scratching or damaging the rims of the wheel and/or puncturing the inner tube. Ease one lever in under the wheel rim and lever out the edge of the tire (taking great care not to puncture the inner tube) and pry it up over the wheel rim. Move around the rim about an eighth of the circumference and repeat the process again, leaving the first tool in place. Now zip the second lever around the wheel and the tire should come right off on one side. \n Best way to find an air leak is by inserting the tube with air in water. Where air bubbles come out , there is a hole in your tube. \n Use caution when feeling inside the tire as a nail, or glass can cut you. Be sure to remove any thorns, glass, or nails with pliers if you find them. Adjust rim tape to cover protruding spoke. \n Unwrap your new tube and remove the plastic dust cap and the lock ring. \n Putting a few pumps of air in the tube before will help to avoid pinching the tube when putting the tire on the rim. \n This process is difficult but try not to use tire levers, a screwdriver, or other similar object as you vastly increase your chance of puncturing your new tube. Check the tire wall for an arrow or similar to indicate the direction of rotation - some tires have a "direction specific" tread pattern. Put one side in first, then ease the partially inflated tube into the tire and put the other side on. \n
 Contract the corners of your mouth to form a round shape with your mouth before phrases like “Oh dear” or “Minnes-ohhh-ta” and extend the emphasis on this vowel. \n This is a similarity to Canadian accents in some areas. \n Practice by saying the word “Sound”. While it only has one syllable and can be said quickly, a Minnesotan might say “S-ownd” or “S-ow-und” as a part of regular speech.\n The “I” should be drawn out and spoken with the mouth open and the tongue behind the bottom front teeth. This is also true when using names and words with the letter “y”. \n Practice by saying the word “Why” and drawing out the vowel. \n For example, the words “are,” “work” and “mother” rely more heavily on the letter “R” in the Minnesota dialect. Stress the “err” sound. \n Try saying the phrase “Oh, dear” to practice the “O” and the “R” together. It can sound like “Oo-ha, De-arr”. \n This is often called “Minnesota nice” because they use an inquisitive tone when speaking with other people. There are several changes in tone throughout a sentence. \n Use the phrase “Oh, that’s interesting”. Although it is a statement and shouldn’t end with an inflection, the Midwestern accent would include an upward inflection with the word “interesting”. it is basically being passive in an aggressive way. \n Thanks to a large influx of Swedish and Norwegian immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Minnesota accent has a sing-song quality, employing inflections and words like “Yah” for “Yes”.Try the comic phrase “Ya sure, you betcha” to practice your use of the regional pronunciation. \n For example, “Have to” is often “hafta”, while “I’m going to” is “eye-mina” and “what are you” is “what-cha”. \n It is a generic, but common reply to questions like “You doing alright?” or “Are you full?” \n Almost all of Minnesota and most of the Midwest call Coke, Pepsi and other sodas “pop”. \n For example, “I didn’t buy that dress because it was too spendy”. \n Other like “can” are pronounced with a similar soft “eh” sound. \n This phrase and “Nice to meet you” are used to indicate you’d like to depart. You also might want to draw out your goodbye like a true Minnesotan and talk about the weather, sports, and politics. This is known as the "Minnesotan goodbye". \n For example, “cash” is sometimes pronounced “caish”. The word “different” is often pronounced with two syllables as “diff-rent”., This is the act of being outwardly nice, without conveying your real opinions or emotions. It is often referred to as “passive aggressive” or “enthusiastic neutral” tone because of the friendly inflections while saying something negative. \n This form of non-verbal communication is used when driving and greeting oncoming cars or pedestrians. You lift your index finger off the steering wheel for a second and set it back down. \n If someone asks your opinion and you want to show a little opinion, “that’s different” will show that you don’t like it, without having to go into detail., Minnesotans may talk while at a 45-degree angle or while looking out at something else. This is a way of remaining nice, non-confrontational, but not too personal. \n It’s better to say “Not bad” than “Not good”. \n Pronounce “Not Bad” as “Naaht Bah-d”. \n

 A personal allowance reduces your taxable income. The more allowances you claim on your W-4, the less money will be withheld from your paycheck for taxes. In contrast, if you claim fewer allowances, more money will be withheld from your paycheck for taxes., Generally, parents claim their children as dependents, but you can claim other relatives if you provide over half of their support and they meet the other IRS requirements to qualify as a dependent.If no one is claiming you as a dependent, you can enter a "1" in the blank provided for line A on the form. \n In line B, you will enter "1" to claim an additional allowance if you are single and only have one job. You also need to enter "1" if you are married, have only one job, and your spouse doesn't work, or if the total income from all work is $1,500 or less., If you are married, enter a "1" in the blank for line C to claim the allowance. If you have a working spouse or more than one job, you can enter "0" or leave the line blank if you prefer your taxes to be withheld at the higher single rate., If you have any children or other dependents, enter that number in the blank for line D., You qualify for Head of Household if you are unmarried and pay for at least half of the household expenses of your dependents. \n If this description applies to you, enter a "1" in the blank for line E.Allowances you claim decrease the amount of money that is withheld from your paycheck for taxes. Therefore, if you are unsure whether you qualify as Head of Household, you should leave the line blank. If you have too little withheld from your paycheck for taxes, you'll end up owing the federal government money., This credit allows you to reduce your tax liability by as much as $1,000 per qualifying child. Sons, daughters, stepchildren, foster children, and siblings generally are included as qualifying children for the purposes of this credit.If your total income for the year will be between $65,000 and $84,000, or between $100,000 and $119,000 if you are married filing jointly, enter a "1" for each qualifying child in the blank for line G.If your total income will be less than $65,000, or less than $100,000 if you are married filing jointly, enter "2" for each qualifying child. Subtract one if you have between two and four qualifying children; subtract two if you have five or more qualifying children.For example, if you have three children, you would enter "5" in the blank for line G: 2 + 2 + 2 - 1 = 5. \n If you plan to itemize your deductions, you'll need to complete the Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet. If you have more than one job, or if you're married and both you and your spouse work, you'll need to fill out the Two-Earners/Multiple Jobs Worksheet.If neither of those descriptions applies to you, you can enter the amount from line H directly into line 5 on your withholding allowance certificate., In the boxes numbered 1 and 2, you will enter your first and last name, address, and Social Security number., In box 3, you must check the appropriate square to indicate whether you are single, married, or married but want taxes withheld from your paycheck at the higher single rate.You are considered single if you are unmarried, divorced, or legally separated according to state law. You also are considered single if you are married but your spouse is a nonresident of the United States. \n You are considered married if you are married according to state law. If your relationship status on the last day of the year is "married," then for the purposes of federal taxes you are married for the entire year.You can choose to withhold taxes at a single rate, which is higher, if you are married but would prefer to have more money kept from your paycheck., Take the number you entered in line H of your Personal Allowance Worksheet, or the result from the other worksheets you needed to use on the second page, and write it in box 5., You may want additional money withheld, for example if you have other taxes such as self-employment taxes to pay.If you do, write down that amount as a dollar figure in box 6., If you had no tax liability last year, and expect a full refund this year, you can write "exempt" in box 7., You've finished filling out the form, but it isn't valid until you sign and date it, declaring under penalty of perjury that all the information you provided is true and complete.When you've completed and signed your form, return it to your employer. Check your pay stubs to ensure the proper amount of money is being withheld each pay period. \n You may want to add allowances if you received a large refund and would like to keep more money in your paycheck. In contrast, you may want to decrease your number of allowances if you had to pay the IRS last year. \n If any event happens that changes your withholding status, such as a birth or a divorce, you must file a new W-4 with your employer within 10 days of the event's occurrence., You should use this worksheet only if you plan on itemizing your deductions such as mortgage interest, or taking certain credits or adjustments.This worksheet also takes into account other non-wage income you might have, such as dividends and interest. \n Deductions reduce your tax liability. You can take the standard deduction, or itemize your deductions. Typically people choose to itemize their deductions when their total itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction.For example, suppose you are single when you file your taxes in 2015. Your standard deduction would be $6,300. When you add up your itemized deductions, the total is $5,000. In that situation, you probably would choose to take the standard deduction.Enter the dollar amount of your estimated itemized deductions in the blank on line 1., The worksheet provides the standard deduction amounts based on your filing status. For example, if you are married filing jointly in 2015, you would enter $12,600 on line 2. \n If the result of that calculation is zero or a negative number, write "0" in the blank on line 3. To continue the previous example, subtracting $6,300 from $5,000 would produce a negative number, so you'd enter "0" on line 3., and enter that amount on line 4. Adjustments, also called "above-the-line deductions," are amounts such as IRA contributions or student loan interest that you claim directly on your 1040 or 1040A.To continue the example, suppose you paid $2,000 in student loan interest that you planned to claim on your taxes. You would enter $2,000 on line 4. \n This is the total amount of deductions, credits, and adjustments you estimate you will claim in the year you fill out the W-4. If you are claiming tax credits, you will have to complete an additional worksheet to convert those credits to withholding allowances.The total in the example for line 5 would be $7,000. \n Non-wage income includes money you receive without working for it, such as interest or alimony.If you received $500 in interest income, for example, you'd enter $500 on line 6. \n If the result is zero or a negative number, enter "0."To continue the example, you would subtract $500 from $7,000. The result is not zero or a negative number, so you would enter the result of $6,500 on line 7. \n In the example, you would divide $6,500 by $4,000 and the result would be 1.625. You would drop the decimals and enter "1" on line 8., Since in the example you are single with no dependents, you have "1" on line H as well. \n If you're planning on completing the Two-Earners/Multiple Jobs Worksheet, enter the total on the first line of that worksheet. If you don't need that worksheet, enter this number on line 5 of your Withholding Allowance Certificate.To finish up the example, you would enter "2" on your Withholding Allowance Certificate. \n The Two-Earners/Multiple Jobs Worksheet is designed to make sure that single people with more than one job, or married couples who both work, have the correct amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks.You should only use this worksheet if the instructions under line H on your Personal Allowance Worksheet directed you to do so., However, if the highest paying job pays $65,000 or less, you should not enter a number greater than "3." \n \n If the number on line 1 is greater than or equal to the number on line 2, subtract line 2 from line 1. Enter that number on line 3 and on line 5 of your Withholding Allowance Certificate, and you are done with this worksheet.If the number on line 1 is less than the number on line 2, enter "0" on line 5 of your Withholding Allowance Certificate. You should then complete the rest of the worksheet to figure out what additional amount to have withheld from your paycheck. This will help you avoid having to pay the IRS when you file your taxes., If you entered "0" on line 5, the worksheet includes some additional calculations so you won't be facing a big tax bill in April.Line 4 instructs you to enter the number from line 2 of the same worksheet. This was the number that corresponded to the lowest paying job. Assume, for example, that number was "3." \n On line 5 you'll need to enter the number from line 1 on the same worksheet, which was the final number you arrived at on line 10 of your Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet. To continue the example, assume that number was "1." \n Now subtract line 5 from line 4 and enter the result in line 6. In the example, the result would be "2." \n Using table 2 provided on the worksheet, find the amount that corresponds to the highest paying job. Assume you are married filing jointly, and your highest paying job pays $50,000 a year. According to the table, you should enter $600 on line 7. \n Now multiply line 7 by line 6 and enter the result on line 8. This is the total amount of additional withholding needed. In the example, that number would be $1,200. \n All you need to do now is divide that number by the number of pay periods remaining in the year. This depends on how often you're paid and what time of year you start. If you started the job for which you're filling out a W-4 in February and will be paid monthly, you would divide $1,200 by 10 because there are 10 pay periods left in the year. The result of that calculation, $120, is the additional amount of money that needs to be withheld from your paychecks. This is the amount you'd enter on your Withholding Allowance Certificate.
\n Since the workstation is the most important place in an office where people spend around 8-9 hours per day, winter proofing this area is very important. Room heaters come cheap these days, and since you will need it only for a particular time period (for few months till the winter gets over), go for the cheapest one available. \n Empty spaces will help in the circulation of cold air, which should be avoided. \n If necessary, just chuck off the professional dress code for the time being. \n But also make sure that the curtains look professional. \n String curtains are a good choice, due to their cold insulating and temperature maintaining properties. \n Also keep the supply of hot water refilled constantly. \n This will help in two ways. You will have the liberty to keep the windows and doors shut and the curtains drawn due to the availability of artificial lighting. Heavy lighting will also increase the heat inside. \n Also insulate the room by covering up all the gaps on the walls, with proper insulating materials. \n Unlike the other ‘professional’ rooms, this place can have a homely fire going on in a large fireplace. \n
 When your child learns to express himself in words and shows a desire to use the phone, it's the right time to explain the purpose of the number 911.\n Explain to your child that 911 is the number to call to ask for help during an emergency. Luckily, it is a simple, short code that children can easily remember. \n Explain to your child what services they can reach when they call 911. For example: \n Explain the role of a police officer. Tell the child that a police officer can help if they think that there is some threat to their safety, like someone breaking into the house, etc. \n Explain the role of doctors/paramedics. Tell the child that doctor or paramedics can help if someone is seriously injured in an accident, if someone falls ill, passes out, etc. \n Explain the role of a fireman. Tell your child that the firemen can come in case of a fire, a flood, or if someone needs to be rescued from an unsafe situation. \n Explain to the child who the dispatcher is. This is the person who receives the 911 calls from people who need help. The dispatcher asks questions, collects information, and sends help. Tell your child that they should not be afraid to talk to this person. \n The child needs to be made aware of the situations in which it's appropriate for them to make a 911 call. These situations include: \n When the child sees a fire, smells smoke, or the fire alarm is activated. \n If the child witnesses a crime, or believes that his or someone else's safety is endangered. \n If the child was in an accident where people were injured, or if they are injured themselves. \n If someone is sick and needs medical help, either on the street or at home. \n If the child is lost and does not know where he is or how to contact his parents. \n However, it's also important to explain to your child the situations in which it is not appropriate to call 911. Explain to your child that the policemen, doctors and firemen are very busy people and do not have time to respond to calls that are not serious. Examples of non-serious situations might include: \n If the child has an escaped pet. \n If the child falls and scratches their knee. \n If the child breaks or loses his bike. \n Let your child know that he or she should never call 911 out of boredom or for a joke. Explain that in some countries, this is even a criminal offense. Also explain that by calling 911 unnecessarily, they may be blocking the line for someone who really needs help. \n Explain to the child that 911 should be called from a safe location. Explain to your child that they must get away from any dangerous places and ensure that their life is not in danger before making the call. \n For example, if there is a fire, the child should leave the house before calling. If they think that someone has broken into the house, they should try to get out and go to a neighbor's before calling. \n However, there are also situations where the child should stay exactly where they are. For example, if someone is sick or injured, the child should stay with them. Let them know that the dispatcher who answers the 911 call can give them information on how to help the sick or injured person., Talk to your child about possible emergencies. Explain the possible situations in which a child should call 911. Encourage your child to name all these situations. \n Ask questions such as: “What will you do when you see a car accident?” or “What would you do if you were alone at home, and see that mom is not well?” “What if your friend fell, hit his head and lost consciousness?" \n This will help your child to recognize the specific situations in which they might need to call 911. This preparation could be vital when it comes to an actual emergency. \n The child must know their own address, name, last name, and parents’ names. Explain that this is because the dispatcher will ask him who is calling, what the emergency is and where it is located, in order to send help. \n If someone in the family suffers from a chronic illness and has frequent problems, instruct the child to call 911 when they see certain symptoms. Write down the name of the disease or condition on a piece of paper and make sure the child knows where to find it. \n In this way, the child will be able to provide this vital information to the dispatcher, which can be extremely helpful once the ambulance arrives. \n Teach your child how to describe their surroundings, in case the emergency happens outside of the home and the child doesn't know where they are. \n Teach your child to look for stress signs or distinct characteristics of the buildings around them. This will help the dispatcher to send an ambulance/firetruck/police car to the correct location as quickly as possible., Instruct your child not to panic when they are making the 911 call. Explain that they need to talk to the dispatcher as slowly and calmly as possible. \n Tell them to answer any questions that the dispatcher might have, in order to give as much information as possible. \n Tell them to listen carefully to the dispatcher and to try to follow any instructions the dispatcher gives as closely as possible. \n If the child does not wait until the end of the call, they might miss out on providing or receiving vital information that could affect someone’s life. \n If your accidentally call 911, explain to them that they should not hang up. Tell them they should wait for the dispatcher to answer and then explain that there is no emergency. \n Otherwise, the dispatcher may locate the call and send help where it is not needed, wasting resources and potentially delaying help to someone who really needs it. \n Have at least one telephone that the child can easily reach and access all times. It's no use teaching them how to call 911 if they can't get to a phone in case of emergency. \n Make sure your child knows how to use a cell phone and how to unlock it. Teach your child the password (if you have one) and show them how to get to the keyboard from the home screen. \n Older phones (such as those at grandma's and grandpa's house) may have a circular dialer. If this is the case, your should show your child how to call from such a phone. \n A finger should be placed at the desired number and the dialer should be turned to the right, all the way to the end. \n Explain to the child that 911 means nine-one-one. Never refer to it as nine-hundred-and-eleven or nine-eleven. In a critical situation, the child may lose time if they expect the phone's keyboard to have the number eleven or ninety-one. \n To younger children, explain the difference between the numbers 6 and 9. Point out that 9 has a circle which is above as its head, and that 6 has a circle at the bottom, like it's sitting on it. \n This is the best way for children to learn and the best way to assess the skills of your child Let the child wait for dial tone (you can act it out or play a recording tone from another phone to prepare the child for how the tone sounds) \n Let the child act out calling 911. First the number 9, then 1, and then 1 again. \n Act the part of the dispatcher. Ask questions like who's calling, where are you calling from and why. \n Teach your child to speak loudly. Get them to repeat information if they didn't say it loudly enough and encourage them to ask you (the dispatcher) to explain again if they aren't clear on the instructions., You can make an appointment with a local dispatcher to do a practice call with your child. Call 911 and ask the dispatcher if he is free to practice with your child right now or if he need to make an appointment. \n 
 Obviously, if you are faking sick on the weekend so you can avoid going to school on Monday, you will be busy faking sick and won't have much time to do the things you enjoy. If there's something you definitely want to do, try to squeeze it in quickly before faking your "sickness".\n Either way, both are a perfect choice. If you start the sickness too early on Saturday, you will have to keep up the masquerade all weekend and Monday, and it will be very hard and your chances of succeeding in fooling your parents that you're sick will be limited and slim. \n Make sure it is something that you don't get often, because if you have faked sick before and used the same excuse too many times, don't try it again or your parents will become suspicious of whether you are really sick or not. If you choose to start the "sickness" faking in the night hours of Saturday, go to your parents' room at roughly 11:00pm or 1:00am, or any time between those two, maybe a bit later, and complain of whatever sickness it is you're using. \n Your parents, if they are the sort that try to convince you, "it was just a dream, there's no monsters", you are likely to be tucked back into your own bed, but if your parents understand how freaked out you get after nightmares, they'll probably let you stay in their room until the night is over. If they do this, say that you feel like you're going to vomit and go and get a bucket, bowl or plastic bag for you to "vomit" in. This way, your parents will think that you really are sick and won't suspect you of going to so much trouble simply to fake sickness. \n or "How will I get through P.E. feeling so sick?" but make sure you only point out things they know you enjoy doing. \n Also, remember to delete your computer's internet history or else your parents will definitely send you to school Monday. \n Beware, though, you also must sacrifice your Monday and be "sick" for the whole of that day. \n Also remember to be very, very convincing that you are sick because Monday is the day most kids choose to fake sickness, because they want an extra day off and are not ready for the weekend to end. \n Stay under the covers a lot and breathe on your hands, then rub them on your face, but if a thermometer is involved, try breathing on it behind your parents' backs, but if it becomes too hot your parents will suspect you of being seriously ill and needing the hospital, or they will know you are faking sickness and had breathed on the thermometer. \n Find something like baby powder and put it all over your face, then wash all off but it will leave a slightly pale effect. If you are pale, your parents will be more likely to believe that you're sick. \n Don't eat anything that's offered to you, but if you do accept it only pick off a little bit and chew it slowly to show that you've lost your appetite and definitely are sick. If your parents are insistent on you eating something, tell them "I'm not hungry!" but not too rudely or loudly. They might reconsider your "sickness" if you have the energy to be yelling and objecting. \n Ask for covers and fake sleeping. If you tend to twitch a lot when you fake sleeping, pull the covers right over you. Your parents are likely, though, to peer into the covers and see how you're doing. Some tips to making sure you fool them into thinking you're really sleeping are: \n Don't move a lot. When they're not looking, if you're uncomfortable move slightly. Only move about every 20 minutes or so. If you keep tossing and turning, they're going to know for sure that you're not actually sleeping and are faking. \n Stay still. Breathe calmly and casually, like you normally would if you were really asleep or very relaxed. This way they'll think you're deeply sleeping and your body is working on getting you better from your "sickness". \n When you wake up from your "sleeping", remember to make sounds like you're sick and uncomfortable. Say something like "ow", which will definitely spark your parents' interest and they will likely ask, "What's wrong?" or think to themselves that you can't go to school on Monday. \n Definitely don't do anything you enjoy doing, because not doing it will convince your parents that you're sick if you're turning down one of your favourite things/hobbies to do. Also remember to work hard and go to a lot of trouble to fake your "sickness". Your parents will never suspect you of faking sickness if you go to a lot of trouble to convince them you're sick. \n There are many dangers and cautions involving this. You should also remember that your parents might just have a trick up their sleeves to catch you out in the act of faking sickness. If you honestly are hungry, you should eat something when your parents aren't going to notice, but this is also a possible danger. Your parents could catch you eating when you have "no appetite". \n While you are busy reading this, your parents might be reading about what kids do to fake sickness. \n There are articles about doing that that could help you in achieving those things. To fake vomit, you could try chewing something, and bring it back up your throat when it's not too far down. Read the article on wikiHow about making fake diarrhea if you want to know how to do that. \n Cough and say something to yourself like, "I wish Mum and Dad were awake to help me", right outside your parents' bedroom door, but as soon as they wake up quickly run to the bathroom or toilet and play the "innocence act". Act like nothing happened and you were just talking to yourself as you walked past their bedroom and that you didn't intend to wake them up. \n Otherwise, if they notice that you are trying very hard to get the point across that you're "sick", they will begin to suspect that perhaps you're not sick after all. Just try hard enough for them to decide you're sick. \n This way, they will think you're sick and won't take you to the doctor because you feel "dizzy" whenever you try to "get up". \n During the night, while you know your parents are sleeping (and any other members of your family) quickly go to the bathroom tap or the kitchen tap and wet yourself. Dry yourself but make sure you remain cold enough to have goosebumps. Once you're certain you aren't wet but have goosebumps, go into your parents' room and complain that you're cold. \n Then go to your parents' room again and complain of stomach, headache, fever or something like that. This will be your last shot at faking before the morning. Remember to keep up the masquerade in the morning as well. Wake up early deliberately to make it seem like you really do need the day off because you won't be focusing to your best at school due to going to bed late and waking up early. Act like it was your sickness that woke you up so early and kept you up so late. \n Spend a fair amount of time in the toilet (with the door shut) and then flush. Make sure your parents don't see the toilet before you flush it, because they will detect no waste to be found in the toilet bowl. \n 
 Sometimes a simple restart will get things working again. Reboot both your phone and your computer and try connecting them again.\n Your S3 may not be able to connect to your computer if your screen is locked. Unlock your screen after connecting it to your computer. \n The cable you are using may only have enough pins to charge your S3, but not enough to transfer data. You'll need a USB cable with five pins, which you can see when you look closely at the plug. If the cable has four pins, it won't be able to transfer data. If your cable is old, consider picking up a new Mini-USB cable.Some users have reported problems connecting the S3 to a USB 3.0 port. Try connecting it to a USB 2.0 port if the S3 isn't showing up. \n Your S3 needs to be connected as a "media device," which you can set in the notification panel: \n Swipe down from the top of the screen while your S3 is connected to your computer. \n Tap "Connected as" and select "Media device (MTP)." Your device should get recognized in Windows. \n Your S3 will not be able to connect to your computer in MTP mode unless you are running Windows Media Player 10 or later. You can install the latest version of Windows Media Player using Windows Update. \n You can check your version of Windows Media Player by clicking the Help menu and select "About." \n Many users have reported that removing and reinserting the SIM card fixes USB connection problems. You will not lose any data doing this. Make sure that your phone is completely powered off by holding the Power button and selecting "Power Off." \n This will expose the battery. \n Lightly push the battery towards the base of the phone and lift it out. \n This will pop the SIM card out. \n Make sure the battery has been out of the phone for at least thirty seconds before proceeding. \n Push it in until it click into place. \n Make sure that the battery is inserted the same way it was when you took it out. \n Wait until your phone has completely booted up before connecting, and make sure that the screen is not locked. \n This will allow you to access your Android's files., Sometimes the drivers for the connection process get messed up. Download Mode will reset the connection between your device and your computer. You'll need the USB drivers from Samsung in order for this to work. \n You can download the USB drivers from Samsung's S3 Support page. Click the "USB (ENGLISH)" button and run the installer after downloading it. \n Press and hold the Power button and select "Power Off." Wait until your phone shuts down before proceeding. Your phone will need to be disconnected from your computer before proceeding. \n Start by holding the Home button, then press and hold the Volume Down button. While holding both buttons down, press and hold the Power button. You'll know you did it right when a warning screen with a yellow "!" sign appears., This will start your S3 in Download Mode. \n Windows should automatically detect it and install the necessary files. \n Windows should only take a few moments to install. Check the System Tray to see if the installation is complete. \n Hold both buttons for about ten seconds to reboot your phone normally. \n If you can't get your S3 to exit Download Mode, take the battery out and then reinsert it. \n After your phone boots up normally, try connecting it to your computer again. It will usually show up properly after booting into Download Mode. \n Sometimes, forcing MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) using your phone's system commands can get the connection working again. \n Enter the following dialer code depending on your carrier:Sprint - ##3424# \n Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile - *#22745927, tap "Hidden Menu Disabled," then tap "Enable." Open the dialer again and dial **87284 \n US Cellular - *#22745927, tap "Hidden Menu Disabled," then tap "Enable." Open the dialer again and dial *#7284# \n This will open additional options. \n You'll see several items to pick from. \n This will force MTP mode for the phone. \n For many users this will fix a phone that doesn't connect. \n If you can't get your S3 to connect no matter what you try, your last option is to perform a complete factory reset. This will delete everything on the phone, so you'll want to back up anything you want to save onto an SD card if possible. \n You can insert an SD card by removing the battery on the back of the phone. \n This will display the files on your S3. \n This will switch the display to all of the folders on your S3. \n This is the emulated SD card that stores all of your files on your S3's hard drive. \n This will highlight all of the files and folders so that you don't miss anything. \n All of the selected files will be copied so that they can be moved to the SD card. \n This will open the storage for the SD card you inserted. \n This may take a while if you have a lot of files. \n Once your files are backed up, you can export your contacts to the SD card as well:Open the Contacts app. \n Tap the "Menu" button and select "Import / Export." \n Select "Export to SD card" and then tap "OK." \n Once you've finished backing up your files and contacts, you can safely reset your phone. You can do this from the Settings app. \n This will open the factory reset menu. \n After confirming, all of the data on your phone will be deleted and your operating system restored. This process may take a while to complete. \n You'll be taken through the initial setup process for your phone. Log in with your Google and Samsung accounts to begin using your phone again. \n Once your phone is powered on and you're logged in, try the connection with your computer again. If you still can't get the S3 to connect and you've tried everything listed above, you may need to get a replacement device. \n

Now select the hole head and select the texture you want to use. Click apply. \n Select your diamond eye and select the black texture. Click apply. \n Select just the beak and create a new brown texture. You can play around with it to get the brown you want. Select it and click apply. \n Go into “Build” and select “Convert to Subdivided” \n Click “Bend” on the box that pops up. \n Rotate the modified cylinder until it is sideways. \n You should check it’s alignment by going to “View/Bottom” and make sure it is directly beneath the head. \n Finally select the same texture you had for the head and apply it to the neck. Congratulations! You just made your first pterodactyl head in anim8or! \n 
 Before starting the job there is a number of required tools you must have. They're listed in the Things You'll Need section of this page. Most should be available with a basic garage tool set. If you don't have a specific one, most auto parts stores will allow you to rent one out by paying a deposit which is returned after the tool is. \n . \n Now that you have all the tools to do the job you'll need to make sure it's done safely. Safety glasses, closed or steel toe shoes, working gloves and preferably pants are all recommended., Place chocks or a solid piece of wood behind either of the rear wheels to prevent the car from moving. \n Loosen the front lug nuts using a breaker bar and a 19mm socket. Do not remove the lug nuts completely! A quarter of a turn in the counter clockwise direction should be enough. \n If you have a wheel lock nut, always remove it first and install last! \n This will unlock the wheel and keep your battery off. \n Make sure to roll down a window or keep a door open so you don't lock your keys in the car. \n Place a small wooden board between the jack and the frame to prevent any damage. You don't have to worry about this if the lifting surface of your jack is rubber., Watch for any movement or slippage of the jack. If positioned properly it will lift the vehicle straight and directly upwards. If you see any tilt or slippage, stop immediately. Assess the situation and lower the car very slowly. Re-position the jack properly and repeat the lifting procedure., This should be enough the position the jack stands underneath the support location. It is identified by two cutouts in the pinch-weld of the car., Then lower the jack onto them until they touch. It is always a good idea to leave the jack just touching the lifting spot, it provides additional safety and saves time later on when lowering the car., Do this by giving the car a slight push down on the hood and sideways on the fender. \n Turn the steering wheel in the direction such that it gives you better access to caliper bolts. (Working on the drivers side, turn the wheel to the left)., Using a ratcheting wrench and a 15mm socket. On this model they are integrated with caliper pins so put them on a rag to be cleaned and re-greased later. Notice that the pins are different. One of them has a rubber insert on it and that one always goes in the top caliper hole., Do this by tugging on it or placing a small pry bar between it and the rotor to pry it off. Use a rubber strap or a piece of wire to secure the rotor to the suspension spring. This will prevent any potential damage to the brake hose. \n If the caliper pin bolts do not move and appear to be seized, stop immediately! Put the wheels back on and have an automotive shop perform the brake job. Removing seized caliper pins requires additional tools. \n Using a 15mm socket. These may be very tight and it might be easier to loosen with a breaker bar. Remove the bolts and remove the caliper bracket. Use a small hammer to make the pads come out of the bracket. Although sometimes they can be removed by hand. \n Do this by pulling and wiggling it side to side. If it is stuck use penetrating oil in the holes where the lug studs come out, let it rest for a few minutes. Proceed to tap the back of the rotor with a hammer while alternating sides to gradually remove it from the hub. \n It does not have to be perfect, as long as major rust is removed. \n If your pads came with hardware (metal shims) you can remove the old ones from the caliper bracket and use a wire brush to clean the rust off from underneath the old shims. \n If you do not have new shims, do not remove the old ones. Just use the wire brush to clean the rust off from the top of the old shims. \n You will notice it is oily. This is done by the manufacturer to prevent corrosion while storing and transporting parts. This oil film needs to be removed by spraying all rotor surfaces with brake parts cleaner. Be very careful using this spray since it is a strong irritant to the eyes and skin. Always use protective eye-ware and gloves. \n Brake parts cleaner usually dries and evaporates pretty quickly but if it does not just wipe it off with a clean rag. It is always a good idea to compare the new rotor to the old one and verify they are the same size. \n Take one of the lug nuts and thread it on any stud by hand as far as it will go. This will make the rotor stay in place and ease the rest of the installation. \n Your caliper bracket should be free of rust on the shim surface at this point. If you removed the old shims, install the new ones now. A good set of brake pads usually comes with a small packet of high temperature brake grease. Apply a very small amount of grease onto the shim surfaces as shown in the picture. \n Manufacturer calls to put thread locking compound onto the caliper bolts. \n Torque the bolts to 133 lb.ft (180 N.m). \n If you look closely you may notice the brake pads are not the same. Two of them should be with small tabs on them and two without. The pad with a small tab goes on the inside surface of the rotor. \n This might be a little tricky. Install the far part of the pad first and gently push in the middle of the pad. It should slide right in. Do the same on the outer side of the caliper bracket. \n In order to do this you need to compress the piston first. It is recommended that you open the bleeder and let the fluid drain out into the drain pan below. Use a 10mm wrench to brake loose the bleeder. Do not use excessive force. If the bleeder does not come loose, stop immediately! Breaking the bleeder will render the caliper unusable and you will have to purchase a new one. If the bleeder does not come lose, open the hood of the car and remove the cap from the brake fluid reservoir, this will release pressure as the caliper piston is being compressed., Position the large C-clamp on the caliper as shown in the picture below. Begin to turn the handle of the C-clamp to compress the piston until it is flush with the surface of the caliper. If the piston is very hard to move, your caliper might be seized and will have to be replaced. \n Discard the old brake pad., Failure to perform this step correctly will cause your brake pedal to be very soft and may become a safety issue. \n Ensure that the pin boots are not folded over and are positioned in the way that the pins will fit in them. \n Remember that the pin with a rubber insert goes in the top hole and through the rubber pin boot. Tighten the bolts and torque them to 70 lb.ft (95 N.m). \n Remove the lug nut supporting the rotor on the hub. \n Afterwards replace the cap of the brake fluid reservoir., Put the wheels back on the studs and hand tighten the lug nuts. Remember to keep the wheel flush on the surface of the rotor. Tighten the lug nuts as much as you can by holding the wheel with your free hand., Stop lowering immediately after the wheels make contact with the ground. There should be minimal weight on the wheels. Just enough to prevent them from moving., If you have a locking nut make sure to install it last and never toque it; just hand tighten. A good way to retain the star pattern and make the locking nut last to be tightened is to start torquing the lug nut directly opposite of the locking nut. \n It is a good idea to check or remove all the tools and old parts from underneath the car before lowering it., Repeat this 3-4 times or until the pedal gets stiff., Make sure everything is working properly and that there is no abnormal noise. Brand new brake pads might cause a slight hissing noise upon braking. You may also notice a strange smell after driving. This is all normal and should only last one or two days. Follow brake pad manufacturer recommendation on break in procedure.
 Take steps to ensure that you are taking care of yourself, if you are struggling and feeling depressed don't be afraid to seek help from friends, family or a health care professional.\n Make time for yourself to create and clarify your values. \n Are you a good reader? Are you a good communicator?, Do you know more than one language? \n Be selective. Do not think that constraints with limited funds allow anyone to take advantage or force us into a decision. Remember, WE are the mothers. As long as we have love for our child, our morals are intact and we behave in a legally responsible manner, all should work out for the best. \n Your safety and the safety of your child/ren is priority. \n Know that while it might take a great deal of time to finish college while being a single parent, you can succeed. \n Make sure to have only friends who are of sound mind and can make healthy decisions care for your child in your absence. \n Cleanliness means health. \n Take infant and child CPR classes from the local Red Cross or hospital, or a volunteer firefighter or EMT. \n Many times these classes will cost nothing if you speak to the receptionist. The Red Cross can not deny anyone classes for lack of ability to pay. The classes can be a life saver. Remember, parenting is a learned skill. \n If we were parented well, all the better, if we think we want to leave some things behind or improve upon them, do so. \n When you get lonely, paint, draw, read, sing, mend something, call a friend or family member. \n That is a continuum that is ever evolving. \n 
 The room or workshop you will be working in has to be the correct temperature so that the varnish will dry properly—at least 70°F (21.1°C).\n Sand with the grain; if you sand against the grain, you will damage the wood. \n Vacuum the piece and the area around it. (If possible, sand the piece in a separate room). Wipe down the furniture with a clean, lint-free cloth. Remove dust and dirt from cracks with a clean, dry brush to make sure your furniture is free of all lint, dirt and dust. You can also blow dust and dirt from the piece with a hand-held hairdryer. Use the cool setting. \n A tac cloth looks like cheesecloth and is a bit sticky to the touch; it can pick up tiny bits of lint that would otherwise get trapped underneath the varnish. \n The brush must be clean. \n Buy a large enough can of varnish so that you have enough to cover the furniture piece. Check the label on the can to be sure of the coverage amounts. \n You will need this separate container to thin out the varnish. \n The amount of varnish depends on the amount of surface area you need to cover. \n Stir the varnish and the mineral spirits with a clean paint stick. Stir slowly and steadily until the two substances are completely mixed. \n Apply the varnish evenly and thinly. If your varnish starts to thicken, add some more mineral spirits to thin it. \n You will have to sandpaper your first coat, but you can’t do that until the varnish is completely dry. \n If this produces a bit of dust, your varnish is dry. \n

 Vanilla orchids require a tropical environment, so you will need sunlight, heat, space and humidity for it to grow. If you live in the South of the United States, Australia or another warm climate you may be able to cultivate vanilla outside. \n Your environment should be 65 degrees (18 Celsius) or warmer all year to successfully cultivate an orchid. Warmer temperatures are preferable.\n You can improve the greenhouse conditions until they are ideal for this type of orchid that requires heat, humidity and partial shade. \n If you don’t have a local florist or garden center that sells these, you may need to order them online. Ensure each cutting is at least one foot (30 cm) long. \n If you are ordering cuttings online, you may want to purchase several to improve your chances of having a vanilla crop. \n Cuttings are usually taken from mature plants that are 20 feet (6 m) or more in length. \n The ends should remain immersed for five days. Notice which end is the top and which is the bottom. \n Add a pinch of liquid fertilizer to improve results. \n The top is the direction in which the plant has been growing. The leaves will point down toward the bottom of the cutting., It will need shade 50 percent of the time, as well as constant support to grow vines. If you are using a trellis, you will need to create a shaded area above the plant. \n Lay the bottom two nodes of the plant horizontally on the top of the soil. Nodes are vine intersections. \n Orchid soil is usually a combination of pine bark, perlite and mulch. \n It must be trained to grow vertically. You can purchase ties or clips online or at a gardening store. \n Never allow the soil to dry out, yet don’t allow it to get too saturated or it can rot. \n The mulch is its food so it should be rich in organic matter. \n Air roots will attach upward to the support and others will reach down to the soil. It will take between two and seven years for the plant to grow large enough to bloom. \n It will encourage roots to grow and the plant to grow larger., It only flowers for a six week period per year and the flowers only last approximately one day.During this time, you will need to hand pollinate the flower in order to grow the vanilla beans. \n Consider asking a local orchid grower to help you hand-pollinate the first few times. It is a very delicate process. \n Push the pollen mass out and hold it up with your right thumb and index finger. Use your middle finger to push the anther back and expose the cam underneath it, which serves as a shield. \n Place the pollen on the ridge. Push the ridge back into place with your left hand and pull the cap back down. \n Repeat with all the flowers. \n Pollinate in the morning. Some sources suggest 11 am is the best time., If it begins to elongate instead of point up, it is pollinated. \n Pods should appear within two months; however, they take nine months to mature. \n Spread your beans on trays and place them in direct sunlight for three hours. Fold them inside cloth to sweat overnight. \n Repeat each day until the pods turn a deep brown. \n Hang them or place them in drying rooms for two to four weeks. \n 
 This way, you'll learn how to set up and break down the rides, how to attract customers, how to deal with unexpected problems and more.\n \n Determine which rides and games you want, and how much each costs. \n Budget for trucks to transport your equipment from place to place and generators to provide reliable power sources. \n Decide how many employees you need. You'll need a crew to set up and break down the carnival, as well as a maintenance crew and employees for every ride when the carnival is open. \n Find out which licenses and permits you need, and how much they cost. \n Discuss how much insurance you'll need for your professional carnival and plan this into your overall budget. \n If buying everything new is too costly, look into buying second-hand equipment. \n This is likely to be a significant amount of money, so take your time and look around for the best deal with adequate coverage. \n Choose locations that offer sufficient customers to make your time there profitable. \n Be sure to get some press and offer some extra festivities, as the publicity will attract more customers. \n 
 \n Diabetic persons should treat fungi under a doctor's supervision.\n \n Soak for 30 minutes each night (or up to two or three times per day -- if you are desperate). Do this for a week or two (for more economy consider saving and reusing the mixture of vinegar-salts for soaking repeatedly, if your feet are clean each time, and freshen it up with a little new vinegar and Epsom salts.) \n If you'd like, you could filter it through old tee shirt material to remove settled out salts, etc. \n Begin killing it the first time, and continue about a week or several weeks, depends on depth and extent of infection. \n \n If it is too sore, wait a few sessions before removing nail debris, loosened dead skin. \n If the nail is very thick, file and scrape it to be very thin, gently, without injuring yourself, to allow the vinegar mix to penetrate more effectively. \n \n Air dry your feet, if you have time. The fungus really love moist skin, damp soaks/shoes and nails, allowing toenail fungus to get its "foothold" originally or repeatedly. \n
 By regulating his feeding, sleeping, playing, and bathroom schedule, you help him fit comfortably into your life. The routine will bring him comfort, and you’ll have fewer “accidents” down the road.\n After that, they should get 2-3 meals a day until they reach adulthood. Feed your puppy the amount recommended on the label. Many labels give only the total amount a dog should eat during the day. You’ll need to divide those amounts into portions throughout the day. \n To ensure the puppy grows well, feed him in meals instead of leaving food out at all times. If he doesn't finish his food within 15 minutes, pick up and remove the rest. \n Very small breeds often get low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). They should be fed four smaller meals spaced out to make sure their sugar levels are healthy throughout the day. \n He'll need a few weeks to adjust to the schedule, so expect accidents at first. But as the puppy grows up, he'll be able to go for longer periods between bathroom sessions. \n Puppies 6-8 weeks old need to use the bathroom every hour during the day until they're housebroken. At night, you should let them out every 2-4 hours. \n Puppies 8-16 weeks old should be able to hold it for about two hours during the day and four hours at night. \n Even when they're as young as eight weeks old, some puppies will sleep for a full eight hours during the night. Most, though, will need to use the bathroom at least once during the night. Do this 2-4 hours after putting your dog to bed. \n It’s best to let the dog out every two hours the first night or two, just in case. \n Begin increasing the time between wake-ups from every two hours to every four hours over several days or weeks. This will depend on the breed and how much your puppy sleeps. — Use your discretion. \n Daytime napping is important for puppies, but if you let him nap all day, he won't sleep at night! \n During play, he'll learn that he's not allowed to bite or scratch, while working off his meals and growing strong and healthy. It also wears him out so he won't have excess energy that keeps him awake during scheduled nap or sleep times. A regular play schedule will keep him on his sleep schedule. \n Training sessions should be fun enough for the puppy to count as play-time! \n Keep your puppy safe while he plays. Help him avoid things like falling, getting stuck, or eating/chewing on things he shouldn’t. \n Crate training is the first step in potty training. Choose a crate with enough room for your dog to turn around comfortably. However, it shouldn't have so much room that he could use the bathroom in one corner and sleep in another. If your puppy learns to associate his crate with using the bathroom, he'll resist going into the crate to lay or sleep. \n In the first few weeks, expect accidents in the crate even if it's the right size for the puppy. Don't lose your patience, though! He's still learning. \n If your puppy is a larger breed, consider buying a crate with adjustable barriers that can be removed as the dog grows. \n The den or family room is a good location for crate training. Leave the crate door open so the puppy can explore it at his own pace, and treat him whenever he goes into the crate. \n After he's grown used to the crate, start closing the door and leaving him in it for longer periods of time. Crate him at night and anytime you aren’t home or able to watch him. \n You can move the crate between rooms, bringing it into the bedroom with you at night, for example. But always make sure it's somewhere your dog feels safe. \n If he associates going to the bathroom with a very specific place, he'll be less likely to have accidents in other places. It'll also make clean-up easier in the future because you'll know where he likes to go. \n Minimize how much time he plays outside during the first 2-4 weeks of potty training. Playing with the dog outside in the middle of his potty training will confuse him about what he should do when he goes outside. When he's mastered potty-training, you can start spending more playtime outside with him. \n "Bathroom" or "Go potty" are examples. When you take him outside, use that same phrase and the same tone of voice every time he goes to the bathroom. If your puppy uses the bathroom after you give the command, praise him with a lot of excitement and a treat. \n You might also choose a separate command specific to encouraging your dog to defecate. Young puppies need to defecate more often, so teaching a dog to associate a specific command with defecating can be useful. \n This isn't a punishment, but a training tool. If your puppy doesn’t use the bathroom within a few minutes of you giving the command, put him in his crate for 5-10 minutes. The dog may whine or cry when confined to the crate, but don’t let them out.–It will confuse the learning process. \n After 5-10 minutes have passed, take him back outside to use the bathroom and give the command again. \n Repeat the process until he makes an attempt to use the bathroom after you give the command. \n When he finally uses the bathroom, repeat the command and reward him with lots of praise and a treat, then let him back into the house to play. \n Hang the bell by the door you use each time you take the dog out. It should hang low enough for your puppy to reach with his paw or nose. Use the bell only with a single door at first. You can move the bell or add more bells at other doors once the puppy understands how the bell system works. \n Very small breed dogs and very young puppies may not be able to hold it long enough to reach the door that leads outside. In that case, hang the bell wherever the dog spends the most time — the living room, for example. You can move the bell to the outside door when the puppy can hold it a little longer. \n It helps to keep the dog’s living area small during the stage until potty training is well established. You might use a puppy gate and attach a bell to it. \n Hold out treats near the bell, and ring it when the dog comes to retrieve the treats. You might smear a little cheese or some other treat on the bell, and, when the dog touches the bell, reward him with an additional treat. Repeat this process until the dog knows to associate the bell with reward. \n Always open the door immediately after any hint of the bell ringing, and give lots of praise. There are a few different ways to train your puppy to ring the bell: \n Without ringing the bell yourself, tap your fingers on the wall or door next to it, and say "Outside." Your puppy should learn to jump up to your fingers, ringing the bell in the process. \n Hold a treat just behind the bell, and say "Outside." The puppy’s nose will ring the bell when he goes for the treat. \n Physically take your puppy’s paw, hit the bell with it, and say "Outside." \n Skip the bell training if you’re rushing out for a bathroom emergency. Only use the bell with scheduled bathroom breaks. \n Your puppy is very smart, and has a great sense of cause and effect. Anything he observes before the door opening/praise/treat will be seen as a cause of the desired effect. If you let variation creep into what your dog experiences before the door opens, he can become confused. Make it easy for him to learn what he needs to do to be let out. Keep it simple. For example, only use one of the methods outlined in the previous step — don't mix and match. \n You can either move the bell to different doors or hang a different bell by each exterior door. When you travel, take a bell with you so the dog can use it while on the road. Similarly, send the bell with your dog if he stays at another home while you’re away on a trip. If you need to find a new home for your dog, let the new owners know he's bell trained, and encourage them to make a bell available at the new home. \n 
 The developers who first found this hack bricked-up (destroyed) 6 PSP units before they got it working. A single miss-step can brick your machine and make it the most expensive coaster available. Please use at your own risk. These instructions will, however, technically allow you to downgrade any PSP that can display .tiff images. \n If you have a higher version you will need different software, and if you are running 1.51 or 1.52 you will need to upgrade to 2.0 before you can downgrade to 1.5 \n Be absolutely sure it is version 1.0.0. \n \n Inside the package you will find a Photo folder with an image inside named overflow.tif. \n \n If your PSP freezes without going to this black text screen, then hold the power button for about 10 seconds until the PSP shuts down, then hit the power button again to start it back up. Repeat this step until you get that black screen. \n Your PSP will start up. \n Navigate to your System Information, and you'll discover that your PSP thinks it is running version firmware 1.0. It isn't, though, and you cannot yet run Homebrew. \n \n Make sure you have your PSP plugged in or the upgrade won't work. \n At the end of the upgrade you will receive an error saying that the upgrade failed and to contact Sony. Ignore this and again force your PSP to power off and reboot. \n After the PSP reboots, you will receive an error screen in multiple languages. Find your language and read the corresponding line. It notes that your preferences are lost and that you need only hit the O button to restore some default settings. \n Do so and then go to the system info pane again, where you will see that you are running version 1.5. \n
 Yes, you have to do the laundry or empty the dishwasher the first time. Don't whine about it or say you will get to it later. Just do it!\n This way you can tell your parents what is going to happen. You will need to let them know when you have to be somewhere, who will be there, what adults will be there, what the activity involves, and what time it will be over. They want to know you are safe when you are away from them. \n Before you do, make sure that person has good intentions, has a license, and is an experienced driver before you ask for permission. You need to contact your parents when you arrive/leave and ask permission if plans are changed and you want to go somewhere else. If they say, "No", accept it without arguing. \n Shouting back and arguing gives a bad impression and makes you look like a 2 year old. After all, they may be right in not letting you do that activity. \n Do these without always being asked to do them. With homework, don't just do written homework. You should also study what was covered in class and read ahead to be prepared for the next class. \n Don't respond out of emotion. \n They will be able to understand you. \n Your parents will love you even more and will do things you want to do for a chance. \n Just really listen to them, say thanks and tell them you will consider it. This will help your parents know that you are listening and are accepting advice. \n Would you trust someone whom you know is simply using you? \n Even if the party is "just getting started," go home when you're supposed to. Even better, be home before you are asked to be home. Remember: is one trivial party going to be worth the trouble and distrust you're going to get (in)? \n This will make arguments and scoldings end quicker, and will keep them less angry at you. \n in a calm and cool manner. \n Doing something that is illegal or not permitted will be one of the fastest ways to lose your parents trust. \n This will help to gain their confidence fast. \n Learning to bite your tongue is a great skill learned as you mature. Arguing, asking over and over, badgering them, twisting their words, trying to guilt them, pleading, trying to make deals with them, etc. will only put you that much further away from earning their trust. \n Your parents want to know you have the good decision making skills of choosing friends or people to hang out with that are only going to be a positive influence in your life. \n 
 If there are four or more players, shuffle two decks together.If there are eight or more players, shuffle three decks together.If you want to use a variant rule, make sure everyone agrees before the game begins. Once the cards have been dealt, the rules cannot be changed.\n Someone can volunteer to be dealer or you can select one randomly. \n Don't look at the cards you've been dealt! If anyone does, shuffle the cards again and re-deal. \n If you play multiple rounds, take turns as the dealer, going clockwise. \n The dealer should give himself the same number of cards. \n Place the remainder of the deck in a face down stack to from the draw pile. Flip over the top card face up next to it to form the discard pile. \n Don't look at the cards or turn them face up yet. \n You can choose the second one after you've turned over your first. \n Use the Scoring Guide for a common system, or use a variation. Write or print it out for people who haven't played before. \n Points are bad! Make sure everyone knows the goal of the game is to get the lowest score, not the highest! \n If possible this should be someone who has played the game before, so the new players can learn by watching them. \n After that player is finished, play continues clockwise, each player taking a turn in order. \n You can take the top card of the discard pile if you think it will be useful. Otherwise, draw a card from the top of the draw pile (the rest of the deck). \n Read the rest of these rules or see Strategy to help you make this decision. \n You can replace any card, whether it's face up or face down. \n Pick up the card you want to replace from your grid and put it face up in the discard pile. \n Place the newly drawn card face up in its place. You cannot shift the position of your grid around before you do this. \n If you don't like the card you just drew, you can discard it face up in the discard pile instead of replacing a card in your grid. You cannot do this if the card you drew just came from the discard pile. \n If the two cards in a column share the same number or letter (for instance, a Queen above another Queen), they cancel each other out and are worth nothing (zero points). \n Remember, you're trying to get the lowest score possible! \n If you like, you can take columns that have canceled out and place them on the bottom of the discard pile (NOT the top). This makes the table less cluttered. \n Once someone replaces their last face down card, each other player turns their grid face up as well and takes one final turn in clockwise order. \n Wait until the last player takes their turn, then flip every card in front of you face up. \n Use a sheet of paper with each player's name on it to record their score for the round. \n Refer to the scoring guide to count up players' points. Remember to follow any variations the players agreed upon beforehand. \n Whoever sat left of the dealer in the last round is the new dealer for this round. The person sitting left of the current dealer always goes first in a round. Keep score after each round until: \n You play 9 rounds, 18 rounds, or some other number everyone agrees on. The traditional numbers of rounds are named after the golf theme and sometimes called "holes" instead of rounds. \n A player reaches 100 points, 200 points, or some other number everyone agrees on. \n When people decide to stop. This works well for casual groups so no one gets bored, but more competitive people might not like stopping when they're behind! \n Each player adds up their score from each round, and the lowest total wins. \n If two players are tied, either let them share the glory or decide on another game to break the tie (such as rock paper scissors). \n This variation can be played with 2 or more players but works best with 3 to 5. If you have 8 or more players, shuffle two decks together.If you want to use a variant rule, make sure everyone agrees before the game begins. Once the cards have been dealt, the rules cannot be changed. \n No one should look at any cards yet. \n The dealer should give herself four cards as well. \n Place the remainder of the deck in a face down stack to from the draw pile. Flip over the top card face up next to it to form the discard pile. \n Remember not to look at the cards yet! They should always be kept face down., Don't let anyone else see what they are. Put them back in place when you've memorized them. \n If you're playing with young kids or other people who have trouble memorizing cards, see the "4 cards in hand" Variation or try using the 6-card rules instead. \n See the Scoring Guide for a common system, or use a variation. Write or print it out for people who haven't played before. \n The goal of the game is to get the lowest score. Make sure no one is trying to "win" by getting the highest instead! \n This can be from the discard pile or draw pile (rest of the deck). \n Read the rest of these rules or see Strategy to help you make this decision. \n Hold this card in your hand. If it came from the face down draw pile, don't let anyone else see it. \n You can replace any card, whether it's one you've peeked at or not. \n Pick up the card you want to replace from your grid and put it face up in the discard pile. \n Place the card you just drew face down to fill the empty space in your grid. You may not move the cards in the grid to different positions. \n Remember to memorize the card you just put down! This variation tests your memory, so you are not allowed to peek at a card after the beginning of the game. \n If you don't like the card you just drew, you can discard it face up in the discard pile instead of replacing a card in your grid. You CANNOT do this if the card you drew just came from the discard pile. \n A pair of the same card in a row or column are worth zero points. Don't show the other players or turn any cards face up to "cancel", though. They remain a face down secret until the end of the game. \n If you have three of a kind, only two of them will cancel out. The third will still be worth its usual value. \n If you have four of a kind, your entire grid is worth zero points. \n Instead of taking your normal turn, anyone can knock on the table to signify that they think they'll win. That player skips their turn, and each other player takes one final turn. Then the round ends. \n You can't knock after someone has already knocked. \n Wait until the last player takes their turn, then flip every card in front of you face up. \n Use a sheet of paper with each player's name on it to record their score for the round. \n Refer to the scoring guide to count up players' points. Remember to follow any variations the players agreed upon beforehand. \n Whoever sat left of the dealer in the last round is the new dealer for this round. The person sitting left of the current dealer always goes first in a round. Keep score after each round until: \n You play 9 rounds, 18 rounds, or some other number everyone agrees on. The traditional numbers of rounds are named after the golf theme and sometimes called "holes" instead of rounds. \n A player reaches 100 points, 200 points, or some other number everyone agrees on. \n When people decide to stop. This works well for casual groups so no one gets bored, but more competitive people might not like stopping when they're behind! \n Each player adds up their score from each round, and the lowest total wins. \n If two players are tied, either let them share the glory or decide on another game to break the tie (such as rock paper scissors). \n \n Cards \n Basic System \n Harder Variation \n Ace \n 1 point \n 1 point \n 2 \n 2 points \n 2 points \n 3 \n 3 points \n 3 points \n 4 \n 4 points \n 4 points \n 5 \n 5 points \n 5 points \n 6 \n 6 points \n 6 points \n 7 \n 7 points \n 7 points \n 8 \n 8 points \n 8 points \n 9 \n 9 points \n 9 points \n 10 \n 10 points \n 10 points \n Jack \n 10 points \n 11 points \n Queen \n 10 points \n 12 points \n King \n 0 points (zero) \n 13 points \n For this optional variation, shuffle in 2 Jokers for each 52 card deck. If you don't have Jokers, instead designate a specific card the "bonus card" (usually Twos or "one eyed Jacks"). \n The Joker or bonus card is worth -2 (negative two) points instead of its usual value. \n A pair of Jokers or bonus cards cancel each other out just like normal pairs, increasing your score from -4 to 0. \n This optional rule punishes players who try to end the game too early, and rewards players who correctly guess when they're ahead. Here are a couple variations. \n The player who ends the game (by "knocking" or by flipping their last card face up) gains 10 points if they do not have the lowest score this round. \n If the player who ended the game does not have the lowest score this round, that player gains a number of points equal to the player who did. \n For example, Scrooge "knocks". After each player takes their final turn and counts up their score, Scrooge has 17 points and Marley has 12. Because Scrooge didn't win the round by getting the lowest score, Scrooge is punished for knocking and adds Marley's 12 points to his own. The final scores are Scrooge 29 and Marley 12. \n Follow the rules for 6-card golf, but give each player a 4x2 or 5x2 grid. \n This will make the game quite a bit longer and may require an additional deck of cards shuffled with the other(s). \n Follow the rules for 4-card golf, but give each player a hand of four cards instead of a grid. \n Players can look at all cards in their hand at any time. \n Any two cards in hand cancel out if they have the same value. There is no "grid position" in your hand. \n This creates a short simple game with no need to memorize cards. \n Follow the rules for 6-card golf, but give each player a 3x3 grid. \n Each player turns up 3 cards instead of 2 at the start of the game. \n A player can only cancel cards by getting 3 of a kind in the same row or column. When they do, they can remove those 3 cards and place them at the bottom (NOT the top) of the discard pile. \n This will make the game quite a bit longer and may require an additional deck of cards shuffled with the other(s). \n There are many different ways to play 6-card golf, and different families and gaming groups will have their own rules. Here are some common ones: \n When you flip over your first two cards, they have to be in the same column, or they must be in different columns.Two of the same card anywhere on the layout cancel out, not just in the same column. This makes the game easier for younger players or beginners.If you have two columns next to each other with FOUR of the same card in them, they cancel out to zero points AND each other player gets 10 points added to their score this round.Players can only draw from the top of the draw pile during the final turns, not the discard pile. \n Again, there are many ways to play. Here are some common additions or changes to the rules: \n You can only peek at the two cards closest to you. \n Pairs across from each other diagonally also cancel out. \n Pairs don't cancel out at all. The only goal is to take the lowest cards and try to end the game when you think you're ahead. \n Players can only draw from the top of the draw pile during the final turns. \n If you're playing a variation that allows you to start with face up cards, choose cards in different columns. This gives you more chances to "cancel" out a column. \n Unless you can cancel out your high scoring cards, you want to get rid of them so they don't add their high values to your score. \n This is especially important as the game draws to a close. If your opponent is almost out of face down cards (or is looking smug), toss out your liabilities as quickly as possible! \n Much of the strategy in Golf comes down to paying attention to the other players.If the player to your right is picking up Sixes, you should give up trying to cancel your own Sixes. They aren't likely to discard any. \n If the player to your left is trying to finish a column of Nines, try to avoid discarding your own Nine. \n 
 You will need to depress the lever on the charging handle and pull the charging handle all the way rearward. While holding the charging handle all the way in the rearward position you will need to push the bottom portion of the bolt catch located on the left side of the magazine well.\n This will allow the rifle to pivot on the forward dis-assembly pin for a “shot-gun” effect. This will come in handy if you just want to pull the bolt out. \n This will separate the upper and lower receivers. \n The bolt carrier group will come with it and should fall right out. Place it aside for further dis-assembly. \n Use the charging handle to depress the lip holding it in the stock. \n Remove the firing pin from the bolt carrier by pushing the firing pin retaining pin from left to right and removing it. The firing pin will fall right out. The retaining pin is very small. Make sure to put it in a safe place. A good place to put it is in the grooves of the charging handle. \n One can easily render the bolt unserviceable by losing the spring found under the extractor. Cleaning these parts in garrison, however, is recommended. \n If the latch is hard to release, use the charging handle to depress it. \n 
 A week or so before school starts, begin going to bed approximately an hour earlier than you did in the summer. This will ensure that you are adequately rested for school, and by the time school rolls around, you will be used to the new sleeping schedule. \n If you have trouble falling asleep, or are extremely nervous, go to bed half an hour early and read until your time is up. That way, you are already relaxed when it's time to actually sleep. Other ideas - you could listen to music, or drink a cup of warm milk.\n Before you can start school you need a few supplies. Your school may or may not have provided you with a list, and if they have, use that as a guide for your back-to-school shopping. If they haven't, find a list on the Internet and use that. You may also want a few new wardrobe items for school. Usually a cute shirt, jeans, and a nice pair of flats will do. \n Get everything in your backpack that you may need, and even pack your lunch. If you carry a purse or another bag, get that together also. Make sure you have your outfit picked out. Go to bed at a reasonable time, and set an alarm for the morning. It's really important that you are well rested. \n First thing when you get up is to eat your breakfast, that way if you spill any of it on you, it won't be on your outfit. \n Go upstairs and wash your face and brush your teeth. Then get dressed, and style your hair. Be sure that you look decent; if you are wearing a t-shirt make sure your armpits are shaved and that you smell good. Definitely put on deodorant and maybe a small amount of perfume. Slip on your shoes and head out the door. \n Make sure that you look confident. Keep your back straight and your shoulders pressed back with your head held high, and don't forget to smile! \n Each subject has it's place and if you need to bring anything home you have all of it with you so you don't forget anything. Having a notebook with all the assignments written in it is also quite helpful. Try doing both of these things. \n If you've had a bad day, talk to someone you trust or maybe just relax and listen to music you like. Music is the best way to calm down. Make sure you pay attention in class, and stay focused each day so you can strive to get straight A's. \n Remember, at graduation there will be awards, and you want to win them. To help achieve and/or win these awards; it often helps to join extra curricular activities! As long as you're involved in something, you have a better chance at winning an award. It can also help with your popularity. \n If you find you have a crush on a class-mate, then just take a deep breath. For guys, just treat her nicely and never tease her! For girls, just talk normally to him and be yourself! Be sure to study for tests. \n Take notes in class that you can review at a later date if needed. \n This leaves you plenty of time to do what you want afterwards. \n Getting close to graduation doesn't mean you can start paying less attention to your school work. You have to study just as hard and think about graduation in your spare time. \n When you do wake up, eat a healthy breakfast, and dress in some comfortable clothes. Then attend all of your appointments. \n Be very careful not to mess them up. Then head on home and put on your dress, shoes, and jewelry. If you want to, add a touch of makeup. \n When completely ready go to graduation and have the best time! \n

In the U.K., a "fanny" is a word meaning the female, external genitalia (vulva)! \n A "fag" is a cigarette. (The British are well aware of the American meaning.) \n While thanks to American culture, "faggot" is sometimes used as the derogatory name for homosexuals (avoid in polite company), in UK "fagot/faggot" can be used to mean "a cigarette, bundle of firewood, a chopped meatball," or "a bundle of anything", though this is an obscure usage.The "loo", "bog", "WC/water closet", or just "toilet" is the American English "bathroom" (e.g. "Where's the loo?"), though if you say you're going to the bathroom, people will get the idea. \n A rubber is a pencil eraser, as well as meaning a condom. \n "I'm stuffed" means "I'm full". The word stuffed can also be interpreted in a negative or insulting manner depending on context (e.g. "Go get stuffed." is a bit more polite than "F**k off.", having roughly the same meaning). \n \n A trash bag is called a bin liner or bin bag. \n They are named after the Duke of Wellington. \n Pants in England are worn underneath your trousers or jeans, just like American panties.

That was the joke used on Emma Watson by David Letterman ("Here, we do that on 4th and long"). The English equivalent is a drop kick, but the mechanics are different. A punt in rugby is a kick in which the ball is hit BEFORE touching the ground. It's also slang for 'a bet' or a gamble, as in 'I took a punt on it not raining tonight', 'I had a punt on a horse race'. \n "Football" is soccer.

 There are tons of interesting Sims in the neighborhood. Make sure you have a Sim that has personalities that suit your Sim like: \n Artistic \n Athletic \n and more!\n Greeting this Sim friendly (if you haven't met him or her) is going to benefit your relationship a lot more, rather than greeting them rudely. If you have a high Charisma skill level, then use a different good greeting like, "Charming Greeting" or "Loving Greet". \n Go to 'Friendly' then 'Get to Know' to find out about them. \n You first start out as an Acquaintance to every Sim (that is not in your family). Simply do friendly things in the 'Friendly' option. Make sure that your Sim doesn't do the same social interaction every time or the Sim that you are trying to impress will get bored. Also, if the other Sim has a trait like, Unflirty or Snob, then you might want to become Best Friends before you move onto the next step. Also become Best Friends before doing the next step if your Sim itself has the Unflirty trait. \n Some Sims like it and some don't. If this Sim doesn't like it, go to the 'Friend' option again and find 'Apologize'. However, sometimes 'Apologize' won't work and you will just creep the other Sim out. In this case, just do other social interactions until the Sim stops finding you creepy. \n Then click on that and see what this Sim says. There is a good chance the Sim will say yes. \n If you don't want your partner to be in your active household, skip the previous step, and this step. \n If the sim responds well, carry on using Flirty interactions (use different interactions each time - the 'Hopeless Romantic' or 'Flirty' trait will add more options to the Romantic menu). \n Click this. The relationship will hopefully change from 'Friend' or 'Best friend' to 'Romantic interest'. \n Wait until 'Propose going steady' appears. \n
 You will need evidence if you want to bring a lawsuit for assault. One important piece of evidence is the police report, if there is one. You may have been given a copy of the police report after talking to the police. Alternately, you might need to contact the police station.See Obtain a Police Report for more information.\n You should try to identify witnesses who observed the assault. The police report should identify any witnesses if you didn’t know anyone personally.You want to talk to them because they could serve as witnesses in your lawsuit. \n Ask what they saw. Ideally, they saw the defendant make a threatening gesture towards you. \n Get their names and also a written statement, if possible. \n Also find personal contact information, such as a phone number or email address. You will want to stay in contact with them as the trial approaches. \n You are also an important witness to the assault. In particular, only you can testify that you felt you were in danger of being struck. As soon as possible, sit down and write down the circumstances surrounding the encounter. \n Also explain if you felt startled. Technically, you don’t need to experience any particular reaction in order to sue for assault. However, your case will be stronger if you were shocked or experienced some other intense emotion, like fear. \n You can be compensated for any physical injury.If the defendant actually struck you, then you can sue for “assault and battery.” Medical records are good proof of the injury you suffered. \n You should also take color photographs of any bruises, cuts, nicks, scrapes, or stitches. \n You might also be able to get compensated for emotional distress caused by the assault.You can document your emotional distress by keeping a journal in which you write down daily how you are feeling. \n If you were prescribed medication to take, then you should also save those orange bottles. You can be compensated for any medicine you buy. Prescription drugs also serve as proof of injury. \n You can also get compensated for lost income if you are unable to continue working as a result of the assault.You should find the following, which will help show how much money you have lost: \n paystubs \n W-2 form \n proof of self-employed income \n tax returns \n You will probably benefit from consulting with a lawyer about your lawsuit. A lawyer can help you think through what evidence you will need to bring a successful lawsuit. A lawyer can also analyze your situation and tell you whether you have a strong case. \n To Choose a Personal Injury Lawyer, start by asking your family and friends for recommendations. Lawyers rely on their clients to refer others, so this is a great way to find trustworthy lawyers. \n You can get a referral to a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.Call up the lawyer and ask to schedule a consultation. Also ask how much the consultation will cost. \n Each state has a “statute of limitations,” which is the maximum amount of time you get to bring a lawsuit. The amount of time will differ by state. It is incredibly important to recognize the time constraints and file before the statute of limitations expires. In your situation, because you are suing a parolee, you may be cutting it really close. In some circumstances, the statute of limitations may be tolled (i.e., suspended) for a period of time. \n For example, in California, the statute of limitations might be tolled when a defendant is in prison. When the offender gets out of prison, the statute of limitations will begin to run again. \n Therefore, in a state like California, you may get longer than the normal two years to file your personal injury suit against the offender., Before suing, you should confirm that you actually have a legal case for assault. Assault is defined as someone intentionally creating a reasonable apprehension that you will suffer harmful or offensive contact.If someone raised their fist to strike you, then they probably have committed an assault—provided you saw them make the action and felt in immediate danger of being punched. \n The defendant doesn’t need to actually touch you in order to assault you. It is the belief that you are about to be harmed that is the injury. \n However, assault cannot consist of only threatening words.Someone has not assaulted you by sending a Tweet that states “I am going to punch you” or by shouting at you that they want to hurt you. \n Also consider your injury. You can sue for assault, even where you haven’t suffered physical injury or emotional distress. However, you won’t recover much money, which could make the entire lawsuit a waste of time. \n In order to collect money damages in a suit against a parolee for injuries caused by them, you must have suffered some quantifiable harm. Work with your lawyer to determine how much this might be. In general, the court will award damages for economic harm and non-economic harm. \n Economic damages are verifiable losses for things like medical expenses, property damages, and lost earnings. These damages can usually be determined by using receipts and bills. \n Non-economic damages are more subjective losses for things like pain and suffering, inconvenience, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment. These damages are usually calculated by multiplying your economic damages by a number between 1.5 and 5 depending on the severity of the harm., Punitive damages are meant to punish.Usually, they are awarded for intentional, highly-offensive conduct. Because assault is intentional, you might qualify for punitive damages. \n Not every state allows punitive damages, so you should specifically ask your lawyer if your state does. \n You should also report the assault to the parolee’s officer, since they need to know whether the parolee has violated the law. You can find a parole officer by calling the probation department in your county. \n The police should also bring the assault to the attention of the prosecutor. If not, you should report the assault to the police if you haven’t already done so. \n Restitution is a court ordered penalty requiring the offender to pay you an amount of money that begins to cover your losses stemming from a crime. Restitution will generally cover medical and dental costs, mental health counseling, funeral costs, income loss, relocation expenses, security system expenses, attorney fees, and potential future losses. \n Restitution is set, by a judge, at the time the offender is sentenced., As soon as you can, contact the district attorney and ask whether restitution is available in your particular case. Chances are, if you suffered a financial harm as a direct result of the offender's assault, you will be eligible. DAs may even proactively send you restitution forms to fill out. \n The DA often has a very short window to present your restitution case to the judge. Therefore, it is very important that you fill out forms and/or talk to the DA as soon as possible after the offender is charged., The DA, during sentencing, will be asked to provide evidence of your injuries so a definite restitution amount can be determined by the court. Therefore, it is important that you hand over all the evidence you have about the injuries you sustained and the financial harm it cost you. This paperwork will be the same type of paperwork that you have been collecting for your civil case. For example, you should gather and hand over the following types of documents:Bills (hospital, dental, funeral, etc.) \n Receipts \n Expenses \n Insurance information \n Once the judge imposes restitution on the offender, your state's department of corrections, and potentially other agencies, will help you collect. While the offender is in prison, money will be taken out of their trust account as it comes in. Generally, the corrections department will be able to take up to 50% of the money offenders receive. That money will then be transferred to you. \n Once the offender leaves prison, your information is automatically forwarded to your state's taxing agency. That agency will work to collect on your behalf through the use of wage garnishments, bank liens, and payment plans. \n If you are not getting paid, you can file a civil lawsuit and, as a part of your larger case, ask the court to submit a court order requiring the offender to pay. \n Restitution orders will never expire, even if the offender files for bankruptcy, so you can continue to collect until you have been paid in full., You can’t just sue someone anywhere. Instead, you can typically sue them in the county where they live. This may be the same county that you live in. \n If the parolee lives in a distant county or in another state, then you need to consider this fact as part of your calculation as to whether you should sue. Talk about it with your lawyer. \n Also think about whether you want to sue in small claims court. These courts are set up so that people can bring lawsuits without a lawyer’s help. Generally, there is a maximum amount you can sue for in small claims court.Check with the court clerk. \n You start a lawsuit by filing a “complaint” in court. This document identifies you as the person suing (the “plaintiff”) and the person who assaulted you as the “defendant.” In many courts, there are printed, “fill in the blank” complaint forms you can use. Check the court’s website or with the clerk. Your complaint should contain the following: \n A description of the factual circumstances surrounding the assault.Make sure to mention the elements of assault—that the defendant’s action was intended to create a reasonable apprehension of harmful or offensive contact.A claim that the assault injured you in some way. The apprehension of offensive or harmful contact is itself an injury, but mention all injuries, including emotional distress. \n A request for money compensation, including punitive damages if they are available. \n Whether you want a jury (available in some small claims courts). \n Your signature. \n When you finish the complaint, make a copy for your records. Then take the completed complaint and your copies to the court clerk. Ask to file the original. Depending on your court, you may need to file copies as well. \n You probably have to pay a filing fee. Ask the clerk for the amount and what methods of payment are acceptable. \n If you can’t afford the filing fee, ask for a fee waiver. \n You have to give the defendant a chance to respond to your complaint. For this reason, you need to send them a copy of your complaint and a “summons,” which you can get from the court clerk.You generally can make service in one of the following ways: \n Pay the sheriff or constable to make hand delivery on the defendant. \n Hire a private process server to make hand delivery. You can find process servers listed in your phone book or online. \n Have someone 18 or older make hand delivery, provided they are not a party to the lawsuit. \n Mail the complaint certified mail, return receipt requested. You can often mail the complaint if you sue in small claims court. \n The defendant will probably file an “answer.” In this document, they will respond to each allegation that you made in your complaint.You should read the answer closely. \n The defendant might file a “motion to dismiss” instead. This document is a little different from an answer. Usually, a defendant will bring a motion to dismiss if you sued in the wrong court or didn’t allege all of the elements of assault. There may be other reasons.If you receive a motion to dismiss and don’t understand it, meet quickly with your attorney. \n The defendant might not even respond to the lawsuit or might respond after the deadline. In either situation, you might be able to get a default judgment.Once you have a default judgment, you can try to get compensated for your injury. \n See File a Motion for Default Judgment for additional information. \n If you receive a response from the parolee, they will likely be contesting your petition. At this stage of the action, you will take part in discovery, which allows both sides to collect and exchange information in order to prepare for trial. During discovery you will collect facts, interview witnesses, find out what the other side is going to say, and figure out how strong your case is. In order to achieve these things, you will be able to use the following tools:Depositions, which are formal, in person interviews with parties and witnesses conducted under oath. The answers given can be used in court. \n Interrogatories, which are formal questions, posed in writing, that parties and witnesses are required to answer. The answers given can be used in court. \n Requests for documents, which are written requests asking the other party to give you certain documents. You might ask for things like text messages, email exchanges, and pictures. \n Requests for admission, which are written statements the other party is required to admit or deny. These statements help narrow the focus of litigation and determine what the true issues are. \n When discovery concludes, the defendant is likely going to try and end the litigation by filing a motion for summary judgment. If successful, the judge will stop the case and immediately rule in the defendant's favor. To succeed, the defendant will have to persuade the judge that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the judge will rule in the defendant's favor, if, even if the judge makes every factual assumption in your favor, you would still lose. \n You can defend against this motion by filing a response. Your response will include specific affidavits and pieces of evidence that tend to prove that factual disputes do exist. If you succeed, the litigation will continue., If you successfully defend yourself at the summary judgment stage, you should discuss a settlement with the defendant. Trials are incredibly expensive and time consuming and settling is a great way to avoid that. Ask the defendant to sit down with your lawyer and discuss a way to come to an agreement. If informal discussion fail, you might need to take part in some other alternative dispute resolution program. \n For example, you might ask the defendant to take part in mediation. During mediation, a neutral third party will sit down with you and the defendant to discuss unique ways to settle the case. The mediator will not take sides and will not inject their own opinions. \n If mediation fails, try non-binding arbitration. During arbitration, a judge-like third party will hear both sides of the case. After evidence has been presented, the arbitrator will draft a written opinion stating who they think should win, and how much they should be awarded. \n As you approach trial, you should pull your evidence together. Identify the witnesses who you want to call, if any. Also get copies of documents you want to introduce. For example, if you have medical records, then you will want to introduce those into evidence. \n Your witnesses must have personal knowledge of what they are testifying about.For example, a witness who saw the defendant throw a punch at you can testify as to what they saw. However, the witness can’t testify to gossip. \n You will likely have to turn over a copy of all documents you intend to use as exhibits. You can make an exhibit by attaching an exhibit sticker to a corner of the document. \n It is perfectly normal to be nervous about what will happen at trial. Ideally, you can prepare by sitting in on one. Check the court’s calendar to see when a trial is being held. Make note of where the parties sit and how they talk to witnesses and the judge. \n Right before the trial begins, you will be required to attend one final pretrial conference with the judge and defendant. During this conference, the judge will set the trial schedule, which includes what matters can be heard. It is your responsibility to tell the judge everything you plan on saying during trial. If you fail to do so, the judge may leave an important issue off of the trial schedule, which means you may not be able to bring it up., If you requested a jury, then you will pick the jury first. Then you will present your evidence to show that the defendant assaulted you. You can call your witnesses and testify on your own behalf.The defendant will get a chance to cross-examine all of your witnesses. \n As you testify on cross-examination, remember to listen closely to the question asked and request clarification if necessary. Always remember to tell the truth., The defendant gets to present evidence second. Typically, you can ask every witness questions on cross-examination if you think it would be helpful.See Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for more information. \n If you had a jury, the judge will read the jury its instructions and then let them retire to deliberate.If you don’t have a jury, then the judge should deliver a verdict from the bench. \n Your work doesn’t end with the verdict. If you win the lawsuit, you face the task of recovering monetary compensation from the defendant. Ideally, the defendant will just pay up. However, if they don’t, then you might need to take other actions. \n If you lost the lawsuit, you might want to consider filing an appeal.You start the appeal process by filing a Notice of Appeal with the trial court. You typically don’t get much time—usually 30 days or less after the verdict becomes final. You should talk with a lawyer about whether it is worthwhile to take an appeal. \n 
 You can allow them to dry slightly in a drain basket before handling them. \n Cut the figs into ½-inch (1.3-cm) pieces and set aside., Add the sugar. Allow the sugar to melt and combine with the sugar over the course of 15 minutes. \n Stir them occasionally to better combine the sugar and figs. \n You will know they are ready when the sugar is mostly dissolved and the figs start to release their water.You can replace white sugar with honey if you prefer to use a natural sweetener. You may want to use only a cup of honey due to its sweeter flavor., Lemon juice adds pectin, flavor a little acidity to the jam. It is a common ingredient in most jam recipes since it helps to thicken the consistency. \n You can slightly reduce the amount of juice you use in the recipe if you prefer a less acidic taste. \n Bring it to a boil over medium high heat., Stir it occasionally., If you lift the liquid and pour it off the side of the spoon, it should fall in thick drops., Ensure you leave ¼-inch (0.6cm) of space at the tap., Let them cool completely. Place them in the refrigerator. \n They will store in the refrigerator for up to three months. \n It is recommended that you double the batch if you are going to the effort of canning. This recipe can simply be doubled without any other modifications., Remove the basket in order to place jars in there when you are ready., Leave ¼-inch (0.6cm) headspace. Wipe the rims with a clean wet towel., This process will seal the jars so that you can store them for a year.
, They starts with the unit (for example, "fem"), and ends with "-tio". However, not all follow this rule, so read ahead: \n Tjugo (pronunciation: ɕʉːgʊ) - twenty - 20 \n \n Trettio (pronunciation: trɛtɪ) - thirty - 30 \n Fyrtio (pronunciation: fœrtɪ) - forty - 40 \n Femtio (pronunciation: fɛmtɪ) - fifty - 50 \n Sextio (pronunciation: sɛkstɪ) - sixty - 60 \n Sjuttio (pronunciation: ɧɵtɪ) - seventy - 70 \n Åttio (pronunciation: ɔtɪ) - eighty - 80 \n Nittio (pronunciation: nɪtɪ) - ninety - 90 \n To say a such number in Swedish, you replace the "somethingty" with the Swedish translation (let's say you want to say 95 in Swedish - then you first replace "ninety" with "nittio"), and then say the unit directly after (you replace "five" with "fem", and also remove the "-"). E.g., 95, 23, 54, and 33 are written "nittiofem", "tjugotre" ("twenty"="tjugo" and "three"="tre"), "femtiofyra" ("fifty"="femtio" and "four"="fyra") and "trettiotre" ("thirty"="trettio" and "three"="tre"). \n 100 is said "hundra" (pronunciation: hɵndra), 1000 is "tusen" (pronunciation: tʉːsɛn) and 10000 is "tiotusen" (see pronunciation for "tio", ten, and "tusen", thousand). It is quite easy; you just add the larger number before the rest, as in English. If there is not just one larger number, such as 2000, then you add that number first, as in English. The same applies if there are many "huge numbers". You do never say "och" ("and") between the numbers, and you never put a "-" there either. If you want to say 3502, then you say "tretusenfemhundratvå" (if you have trouble reading it, then try this: "tre-tusen-fem-hundra-två", "three-thousand-five-hundred-two"; however, you should not write with "-"-marks). \n
 Black and brown are the most popular neutral colors. You can also try nude/tan, white, and gray as well. Silver and gold are also both considered to be neutral, and are ideal for evening looks. \n Plan ahead. Avoid mixing contrasting colors, such as black booties and a white dress. This will "cut" your legs in half, and make them appear too short.\n The more slender your heel is, the more chic and sophisticated your outfit will look. A sleek, slender heel is also ideal if you want a more dressy look. \n Shiny materials make things look bigger. Matte materials, such as leather, suede, or canvas, make things appear smaller., Ideally, the cuff of the boot should extend just past the ankle as well.You might also want to skip excessive details, such as heavy embellishment or lots of straps. These will only add bulk to your boots, and thus to the ankle area., These styles tend to be more comfortable than ones with high heels and pointed toes, especially after hours of walking. They are ideal for casual, day-time looks., The pointed toes and higher heels automatically make these styles look fancier than their casual counterparts. They are feminine, and great for elongating the leg. They are ideal for date nights where you won't be doing a lot of walking., Depending on what body shape you have, different boot styles will help balance your body out. Listed below are some ideas based on the four main body types:If you have a pear-shaped body, your hips are wider than your shoulders. Opt for a simple pair of ankle boots with a heel. \n If you have an inverted triangle shape, your shoulders are wider than your hips. Try a pair of brightly colored boots. Heavily-embellished styles will also work. This will give the illusion of curvier legs. \n If you have a rectangle body shape, your hips, wait, and shoulders are the same size. Try a pair of detailed boots, as this will give the illusion of curves. \n If you have an apple body shape, your widest point will be your waist or torso. Opt for a pair of brightly colored or heavily-embellished boots. This will draw the attention away from your waist, and give the illusion of curves. \n Much like body type, different boot styles will help balance things out like height, curves, or lack of curves. Listed below are some ideas based on different height and size combinations:If you are short and slim, go for heeled boots that cover the ankle. This will make your legs appear longer. Avoid boots that end at or below the ankle. \n This will extend your legs, and give you a longer, sleeker look. \n If you are tall and curve, skip the cuff details. Too much detailing along the cuff will draw too much attention to your calves, and make them appear thicker than they actually are. Instead, opt for plain cuffs. \n If you are tall and slender, you can go with any style of boot. \n Anything that ends about mid-thigh would be idea. The shorter your dress is, the longer your legs will appear. Long dresses (knee-length and loner) are generally not recommended for ankle boots, as they tend to shorten the leg. \n If you must wear a longer dress, consider wearing some opaque tights that match the color of your boot. The ideal combination is black boots and black tights. This will make your legs appear longer. \n Long dresses are generally not recommended for booties, because they tend to make the legs appear too short. You can resolve this by getting a dress whose hem ends just above the boot. If you want to wear a maxi-length dress, try one with a slit up the side.Both of these tricks will help keep your legs from looking too short or stumpy. \n Try pairing longer dresses with fancier boots that have slimmer heels and toes. Casual boots, with wide cuffs and chunky heels will look better with shorter dresses., This will allow your accessories (such as wide belts and layered boho necklaces) really shine through without making your outfit appear too cramped. The dress can have a pattern on it, if you'd like, but tone down the embellishments, such as beading and embroidery. \n Bulky, heavy boots will "weigh" the dress down. Some embellishments, such as a simple strap, won't take away from the look, however., Depending on what sort of dress your wear with your booties, you can draw the focus away from certain areas, and direct it to others. Here are some tips based on different body types:If you are short and slim, try bubble skirts, rompers, and mini dresses. To make your legs appear longer, wear some opaque tights that match the color of your boot. \n If you are petite and curvy, try an A-line dress that ends just above the knee if you are petite and curve. Avoid wearing dresses that end below the knee, as this will make your legs appear shorter. \n If you are tall and curvy, try a long tunic-type dress or a semi-voluminous dress with dark tights. This will help make your legs appear more slender. \n If you are tall and slender, try a dress that ends just above the knee. \n Not all boot styles go well with all dresses. Creating contrast between boot and dress styles can make a boring outfit look more interesting. The wrong type of contrast, however, can make your outfit look clashy, and not in a good way. For example, thick, chunky booties won't look good with a lacy evening dress.Here are a few tips to keep in mind when putting your outfit together:Pair boots with pointed toes and slender heels with fancier dresses. Pair boots with rounded toes and flat or chunky heels with casual dresses. \n Try sleek dresses with boots that have sleek heels. If your dress is simple, then you can go wild with the accessories. \n Try cowboy styled boots with high-waisted dresses for that vintage feel. \n Note any details on your boots, such as studs or beaded trim. Choose accessories, such as belts or jewelry, that match these details. If your boots are plain, look at the style of your dress instead. \n If you are wearing simple, leather boots and a boho styled dress, try adding a wide, leather belt, some feather earrings, and a rustic necklace made from natural stones. \n If you are wearing a simple dress with leather, studded boots, try adding a matching, studded leather belt, and some silver jewelry. \n Leather ankle boots, a sleeveless tribal patterned midi, a long necklace, and a fedora all look fabulous for a boho look. \n Something as simple as a matching jacket can make a flirty, girlish outfit look more formal and business like. For example, a fit and flare dress with slender-heeled booties will give you a flirty and girlish look. Adding a jacket and/or belt over the dress will immediately give you a more businesslike look., If your boots already have a lot of zippers, studs, or straps, you might want to keep the rest of your outfit looking simple. This also includes your dress. Instead, try a simple belt, scarf, or a pair of stud earrings.If your accessories and dress are too detailed as well, your entire outfit will look too busy. \n A simple dress and boots are like a blank canvas. Try adding some longer earrings and a statement necklace. You can also play around with other accessories, such as a belt, bag, and hat or scarf. Try not to go overboard with your accessories however; if you add too many, your outfit will appear too cluttered. \n Black tights and black booties are great for making your legs appear longer, but they won't make your outfit look very interesting. Patterned tights, however, will.Make sure that your patterned tights match your outfit somehow. For example, if your dress has roses on it, try tights made from lace with a rose design. If your boots have a chevron print on the cuff, try tights with a chevron weave. \n For a more chic look, try a slim belt over a plain sheath dress with slender-heeled boots. \n 
 \n Pronounce this French word as wee. \n If you want to make this response more polite, you can add the French equivalent of “mister,” “missus,” or “miss” to the end of the term. \n Monsieur, pronounced muh-see-euh, translates into “mister.” Oui, monsieur. \n Madame, pronounced mah-dehm, translates into “missus.” Oui, madame. \n Mademoiselle, pronounced mah-dehm-mwah-zel, translates into “miss.” Oui, mademoiselle. \n \n It means “yes, please.” \n As a phrase, s'il vous plaît translates into “please.” More literally, it means, “if you please.” \n S'il means “if.” \n Vous means “you.” \n Plaît” means “please.” \n This French phrase should be pronounced as WEE, sill voo PLEH. \n This is the French equivalent of the English “yep.” \n Roughly pronounce this French slang term as oo-wayp. \n N is silent! \n N is silent! \n \n The French à means "with," "to," "by," or "in" when translated into English. \n Fait means "fact," "event" or "occurrence." \n Pronounce this French phrase as too tah feh. \n This translates loosely into “indeed” or “in fact.” \n En means "in." \n Effet means "effect." \n Pronounce this French phrase as on -ay-feh. \n \n Pronounce this French phrase as tray byahng. \n \n C'est means “it is.” \n Bien means “well” or “good.” \n This French phrase should be pronounced as say byahng. \n
\n Non-leap years will be referred to throughout the guide as “normal years.” The Gregorian calendar repeats exactly every 400 years. Note that the Gregorian calendar has been reformed in the past and that this algorithm only applies to the Gregorian calendar in its most recent state. For more information on this reform and its consequences for calculating the day of the week, refer to the “Julian calendar” section of the Wikipedia article entitled “Doomsday rule”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule#Julian_calendar. \n In this guide, the notation “C.E.” and “B.C.E.” will be used. “C.E.” means “Common Era” and is equivalent to “A.D.” “B.C.E.” means “Before the Common Era” and is equivalent to “B.C.” For more information refer to the Wikipedia article entitled “Common Era”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era. Think of C.E. years as positive and B.C.E. years as negative (but subtract one from them first). For example, think of 1670 C.E. as 1670, but think of 1540 B.C.E. as -1539. Note that there is no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar, so you must subtract 1 from 1540 before placing a negative sign in front of it. For a more detailed explanation, see the Wikipedia article entitled “Astronomical year numbering”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering. \n In this guide, the formats mm/dd and mm/dd/yyyy will be used to represent dates in compact form. For example, 8/6 is equivalent to August 6th, 7/24/1670 is equivalent to July 24th, 1670 C.E., 12/6/534 is equivalent to December 6th, 534 C.E., and 10/23/-1889 is equivalent to October 23rd, 1890 B.C.E. \n April, June, September, and November have 30 days. February has 28 days during a normal year and 29 days during a leap year. Leap day, that is, the day that only exists during a leap year, is February 29. There is a useful mnemonic to distinguish between months with 31 days and fewer than 31 days. Hold out your right hand. Tap the knuckle of your index finger and say “January.” Tap the gap/dip/valley between the knuckles of your index and middle fingers and say “February.” You can remember that January has more days than February because your knuckle is taller than the gap. Next tap the knuckle of your middle finger and say “March.” Notice as you continue that all of the months with 31 days are on knuckles, while all of the months with fewer days are in gaps. You’re probably wondering: “What do I do once I get to July?” because July is on the knuckle of your pinky. Just go back to the beginning; tap the knuckle of your index finger again and say “August.” Continue from here to get to the rest of the months. \n Here are some easy-to-remember Doomsdays: 4/4, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12, 5/9, 9/5, 7/11, and 11/7. A mnemonic for the last four Doomsdays in the list is: “9 to 5 job at a 7-11 gas station.” For example, in the year 2000, April 4, June 6, July 11, and November 7 are all Tuesdays. (Important note: this does not mean that April 4, 2001 was also Tuesday. April 4, 2001 was actually a Wednesday.) You can add or subtract 7 from any Doomsday to get another Doomsday. For example, 5/9, 5/16, and 5/23 are all Doomsdays. You don’t have to just add or subtract 7 at a time though; you can use any multiple of 7. For example, 9/5 and 9/26 are both Doomsdays, because 5+7*3 ≡ 26. Another easy-to-remember Doomsday is 3/0. No this is not a typo; 3/0 is simply another way of thinking about the last day of February. Unlike 2/28 or 2/29, 3/0 is always the last day of February, regardless of whether or not it is a leap year. The world can even think of months as having negative days. For example, 8/8 and 8/-6 are both Doomsdays. To convert 8/-6 into a normal date, simply add the number of days in the 7th month (August). Use the knuckle trick from the previous paragraph to determine that there are 31 days in August. So, 8/-6 is the same as 7/25, because -6+31 ≡ 25. We may also think of months as having days greater than 31. For example, 10/10 and 10/34 are both Doomsdays. To convert 10/34 into a normal date, simply subtract the number of days in the 10th month (October). Our knuckles tell us that October has 31 days, so 10/34 is 11/3, because 34-31 ≡ 3. We can even write June days as March days. For example, 6/6 and 6/-64 are Doomsdays. May (month 5) has 31 days, so 6/-64 ≡ 5/-33. April (month 4) has 30 days, so 5/-33 ≡ 4/-3. March (month 3) has 31 days, so 4/-3 ≡ 3/28. Thus, June -64th is equivalent to March 28th, which is a Doomsday. Be careful to account for leap years when using these tricks to determine Doomsdays in January or February. For example, in ANY year, 3/0 and 3/-14 are both Doomsdays, but in a leap year February has 29 days, so 3/-14 ≡ 2/15, while in a normal year February has 28 days, so 3/-14 ≡ 2/14. Thus, February 15th is a Doomsday during leap years, but February 14th is a Doomsday during normal years. You have to be careful when going from March to January as well. Leap year: 3/-42 ≡ 2/-13 ≡ 1/18; normal year: 3/-42 ≡ 2/-14 ≡ 1/17. \n \n Sunday ≡ NONEday ≡ 0 \n Monday ≡ ONEday ≡ 1 \n Tuesday ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2 \n Wednesday ≡ THREE’Sday ≡ 3 (lame, I know) \n Thursday ≡ FOUR’Sday ≡ 4 \n Friday ≡ FIVEday ≡ 5 \n Saturday ≡ SIXAday ≡ 6 \n Sunday ≡ SE’ENday ≡ 7 (“se’en” as in a contraction for “seven” that sounds like “sun”) \n Because there are seven days in a week, you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 at ANY point during ANY part of ANY day-of-the-week calculation. This is why Sunday is both 0 and 7. Monday could be thought of as -6, 8, 71, etc. Throughout the guide you will see (and have been seeing) congruence symbols, ≡, rather than equals signs, =, because 71 does NOT equal 8, but they are equivalent for the purpose of determining the day of the week. While finding a day of the week we are only interested in the remainder when numbers are divided by 7. All of these congruence are thus “modulo 7,” abbreviated “mod 7.” Numbers are congruent modulo 7 if their remainders are the same when they are divided by 7. This is equivalent to the earlier point that you can add or subtract multiples of 7 as you wish. For example, 1 ≠ 8, but 1 ≡ 8 (mod 7). More examples of the way in which modulo behave are -15 ≡ -1 ≡ 6 (mod 7) and 4 ≡ -3 ≡ 7004 (mod 7). The notation “(mod 7)” will be left off throughout the guide, because all congruences are assumed to be modulo 7. \n If you know that August 8, 1953 is a Saturday, then you can quickly determine that August 4, 1953 is a Tuesday, because four days before SIXAday is TWO’Sday. That is, 6-4 ≡ 2. Likewise, if you know that 9/5/1776 is a FOUR’Sday, then you can quickly see that 9/7/1776 is a SIXAday, because 7-5 ≡ 2 and 4+2 ≡ 6. Remember that you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 to a Number-day. If you know that 10/10/-2543 is a SIXAday, then you can quickly determine that 10/2/-2543 is a FIVEday, because 2-10 ≡ -8 ≡ -8+7 ≡ -1, and 6+(-1) ≡ 5. Once again, remember to watch out for leap years, like 18,400. If you know that 2/28/18,400 is a ONEday, then you can quickly determine that 3/3/18,400 is a FIVEday, because 2/28/18,400 ≡ 3/-1/18,400 and 3-(-1) ≡ 4 and 1+4 ≡ 5. \n For example, every Doomsday in 2009 is a Saturday, so the Year-day of 2009 is Saturday. The “Century-day” of any given century is the “Year-day” of the first year of the century. The “Century-year” is the first year of any given century. The Year-day of 1900 is Wednesday, so the Century-day of the 1900s (i.e. the 20th century) is Wednesday. Also, 1900 is the Century-year of the 20th century. Note though, that the Century-year of the century that -1362 lies in (i.e. the -1300s or the 14th century B.C.E.) is -1400, NOT -1300, because -1400 comes before -1300. Remember also that -1400 is equivalent to 1401 B.C.E., NOT 1400 B.C.E. \n These Year-days are called “Big Tuesdays” (just to help you remember them). Years that are divisible by 400 are called “Big Tuesday-years,” and centuries that have Century-days that are also Big Tuesdays are called “Big Tuesday-centuries.” Thus, the Year-day of 1600 is a Big Tuesday. The Century-days of the 2000s, the -4400s, and the 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesdays, the 2000s, the -4400s, and 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesday-centuries, and 2000, -4400, and 96,812,000 are all Big Tuesday-years. \n Subtract 100 from the Century-year until you get to a Big Tuesday-year. Count how many times you subtracted 100. If you subtracted 100 once, then the Century-day is Sunday; if twice, then it’s Friday; if thrice, then it’s Wednesday; if four or more times, then you messed up, because one of every four Century-years is a Big Tuesday-year. For example, the Century-day of the 1800s is Friday, because you subtract 100 twice to get 1600, which is a Big Tuesday-year (because it’s divisible by 400). The pattern looks like this: 1600 ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2, 1700 ≡ SUNday ≡ 0, 1800 ≡ FIVEday ≡ 5 ≡ -2, 1900 ≡ THREE’Sday ≡ 3 ≡ -4, 2000 ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2 ≡ -5, and so on. Note that you can get from one Century-day day to the next by subtracting two from the initial Century-day. This only works when the larger of the two adjacent centuries is not a Big Tuesday-century. That’s fine though, because you already know that the Century-day of every Big Tuesday-century is TWO’Sday. \n The “Dozen-day” of any given year is the Year-day of the Dozen-year. The Dozen-day can be calculated by adding the Century-day to the result of the division by 12. For example, the Dozen-year of 1234 is 1224, because 1224-1200 ≡ 24 ≡ 12*2, and no larger years that are still less than or equal to 1234 yield a positive difference with 1200 that is divisible by 12. Since the Year-day of 1224 is Thursday, the Dozen-day of 1234 is also Thursday. Note that the Dozen-days for 1235, 1226, and 1229 are all Thursdays as well; while the Dozen-days for 1236 and 1238 are not the same (they are, in fact, Fridays). For another example, we can calculate the Dozen-day of -1713. We first need to find the Century-day of the -1700s. Since we must subtract 100 three times from -1700 to arrive at a Big Tuesday-year, the Century-day is THREE’Sday. Next we must find the Dozen-year. Note that the Dozen-year is not -1712, but rather -1716, because -1716-(-1800) = 84 = 12*7. So, the Dozen-day of -1713 is 3+7 ≡ 3 ≡ THREE’Sday (since we can subtract 7 as we please). \n The “Quad-day” of any given year is the Year-day of the Quad-year. For example, the Quad-year of 1620 is 1620; while that of 1643 is 1640. The Quad-days of 1640, 1641, 1642, and 1643 are all Wednesday; while the Quad-day of 1620 is Saturday. We can calculate the Quad-day as follows. If the given year is 1642, then the Dozen-year is 1636, because 1636-1600 ≡ 12*3. The Century-year, 1600, is a Big TWO’Sday. 3+2 ≡ 5, so the Dozen-day of 1642 is FIVEday. Subtract 4 from the Quad-year, 1640, until you get to the Dozen-year. Multiply the number of times you subtracted 4 by -2, and add this result to the Dozen-day to get the Quad-day. In our example, 1640-4*1 ≡ 1636, 1*-2 ≡ -2, and 5+(-2) ≡ 3, so the Quad-day of 1642 is Wednesday (as mentioned previously). Wednesday, is thus also the Year-day of 1640. \n Add the result to the Quad-day to get the Year-day. In our example, 1642-1640 ≡ 2, and 2+THREE’Sday ≡ FIVEday, so the Year-day of 1642 is Friday. \n For example, if the date were 9/5/1642, you would already know that it was a Friday. If the date were 6/20/1642, then you would subtract 7 days twice to discover that 6/20/1642 is the same day of the week as 6/6/1642, which is a known Doomsday. This means that 6/20/1642 is also a Doomsday, and is therefore a Friday. \n We know 4/4/1642 is a Doomsday, so we add 14 days to discover that 4/18/1642 is a Doomsday. Now we know that 4/18/1642 is a FIVEday, so we simply add 2 days to find that 4/20/1642 is a SE’ENday. Don’t forget that the nearest known Doomsday may not be in the same month. For example, 3/29/1642 is closer to 4/4/1642 than to 3/0/1642. Since 4/4/1642 ≡ 4/-3/1642 ≡ 3/28/1642, we know that 3/29/1642 ≡ FIVEday + 1 ≡ SIXAday. \n 
 \n a.If you do not have a square sheet of paper, take a sheet of computer paper placed so it shorter side is facing towards you. \n b.fold the top edge to the left edge resulting in a folded area that looks like a right triangle and a rectangular area at the bottom. \n c. Cut out the rectangular area at the bottom so you are left with only the double layered right triangle. \n d. Unfold the triangular piece – this is your square shaped piece of paper.\n Then unfold. \n Then unfold. \n Fold each of the corners to the center. The resulting piece of paper will look like 2 squares of paper on top of each other with the top consisting of 4 triangular shaped pieces and the bottom consisting of one square piece. \n This should result in a rectangular shape. \n This should transform your rectangular shaped piece of paper into a square. \n Then unfold. \n Then unfold. \n Take one of these and pull it out to the side. It will form a flap on the side of the first two layers of paper. It will look like the fold you just made and the fold between the corner of the square and the center make a triangle. \n The resulting mass should look like a square with triangles on top and bellow it. Alternatively, it looks like two trapezoids next to each other. \n The folded mass should look like a six sided figure with the two long sides of the square on the left and right and the four sides of the triangles on the top and bottom. \n This will fold both the square and part of the triangles. \n At this point the left and right sides should be much longer then they were before. \n By doing this, you will make the section of the paper that was these triangles into a trapezoid shape. \n By doing this, you will pull a large triangular area of paper out from inside the folds of the paper. The resulting shape of the paper looks like the structure you started with along with two large triangles at its left and right side. \n The paper should look like two identical five sided shapes. \n Take the three corners that do not face the center of the paper in each of the five sided shape and fold them to the center of the five sided shape. This center should be easy to spot as not only are there lines intersecting to the center but also there are creases where you are going to fold. The resulting shape should look like two squares side by side. \n For the right square take the rightmost side and fold it into the center. \n The resulting shape should look like a small trapezoid and rectangle in the center of the paper. \n This will give the paper its three dimensional shape and result in your paper ship. \n 
 If nobody on your team is fast, then let the other team get the balls and just stay back and try to dodge and catch. If you and your team do get them, then roll the extras back to your side so the enemy won't get them.\n Get the average throwers out first so there are less distractions. If you are a bad thrower, just catch them as they get thrown at you. \n This will help you gain power for the throw. If they throw a ball at you while going towards the middle line, crouching and running up to the line will help you dodge it because you are ready to move quickly and you will be a smaller target. This will make it harder for them to hit your body and when they throw it, it will be towards your head and therefore easier to dodge because instead of moving your whole body you will just have to move your head. And, also, in some games of dodgeball, throwing at the head doesn't count! \n Let it come to your chest and when it is about two feet from you start to bring your hands up to catch it. By the time it hits your chest your hands should be there to make sure that it has nowhere else to go. This should make sure that you catch it. \n TRY AS HARD AS YOU CAN TO STAY ON YOUR FEET. If you fall down it may look cool but it leaves you a sitting duck for attacks. \n Pretend that you are fighting for your life and you are facing your greatest rival. \n Sometimes, it will miss and you can catch it. The oldest trick in the book is to deliberately throw it a little far off from the target, hoping that the person will go in that direction. \n This will help you hit the target. \n Take out the good players first so they don't get teammates out. \n This means no resting or "time outs". \n He/she will most likely try to pick the ball up if he or she does throw the second ball at them. \n
 You don't need to have the wigs or the rugs, though. If it is a hair salon, you only need the items for your hair. Since they are all gone, you may need to trade for them. Just yell out in Jamaa Township: "Does anyone have any salon den items? If so, I'd love to trade for them!" If all else fails, you don't need spa items. Use an inflatable pool (make it white, I use a white pig pool and it's awesome.) for a hot tub. If you are using the beach den skip this step because it already has a pool. You could use a mirror that you can find at Outback Imports as a substitute for a vanity. Get creative!\n You need it to look good so people don't leave. Try adding some plants music, wallpaper, flooring, and some sort of rug. Everything should match. It should be wide and spacious. If you don't have a big enough den to fit all of your decorations in, you could use multiple small dens, but that would require a LOT of switching dens, so that isn't recommended. Nice music attracts customers and keeps them occupied in the waiting room, more about that on step 4. Wallpapers with different colors, like the pink striped wallpaper, look good. Avoid the rainbow wallpaper. Stick with wooden floors (beta wooden floor, wooden tiles, and wooden planks that come with the small den.) and don't have anything crazy, so avoid the grass floor. \n You can add them in and tell customers to take one after they leave your salon! Like in step 1, it's a spa item, so you may need to trade for it. You could buy a fancy coffee table from Epic Wonders and put some books on it (or put a bookshelf next to it.), but you may need to trade for the books too. You may need to advertise your salon too, so that's why the customers need the magazines. \n Add couches and things to play with so your customers don't get bored and leave your salon. If you are using a separate den for the waiting room, be sure that there is a bunch of stations in the actual salon, because people will get annoyed going back and forth from one den to another. You should have nice music in the waiting room den to keep customers happy. \n You could also hire someone to greet the customers when they come in. If you'd like, add a welcome mat to the front. If you have a door in the front, make sure to open it so people can come in. If you have a greeter, be sure to check on them once in a while. If the greeter has to get off, put some couches next to the entrance so people cat sit while they wait to come in., Just say "Ok" and politely tell them to leave. If they don't leave, tell them you are going to lock them out and lock them out. Before you let everyone in, buddy them so you don't have to do it when you lock them out, or else it might just be an awkward moment of silence. It is also important to because they might report you while everyone is buddying you., If they don't, then lock them out or report them. If other people get jealous and go to the front of the line, lock them out too. Tell the remaining customers that everyone should not cut to the front of the line and wait politely. DO NOT TYPE LIKE THIS!! IT WILL GET CUSTOMERS MAD AND THEY WILL REPORT YOU!!!, Try and have a nice conversation with the "nice" customers. Who knows, you may host the salon lonely and come out being popular with your buddy list full!, You get tips by being nice to customers, providing a wide variety of services, and having your salon in tip-top shape, like in the step above. Don't be greedy and ask for tips, because it gives you a bad reputation. People in Animal Jam usually have a bad temper, so you could easily start a huge fight and all your customers will be yelling at you!, If they say no, kindly warn them they will be locked out and reported. If they stop, don't do it. If they do, then lock them out or report hem., If they ask for something that you don't provide, kindly tell them you don't provide it. If they yell at you or lose their temper, block 'em and lock 'em. If they ask for something you do provide (for example: the full treatment) then do the full treatment., Make sure to rinse it out and let it dry. Then brush their fur to rid it of any ratty areas. If they want, do their hair. Keep some hairspray by., They will most likely change their fur color. Ask them what color they want. If they reply saying "This is the wrong color!" or "It's ruined!" ask them specifically what color they want (for example: the purple on the top left) and you should be able to know what color they want. If they like it, then smile and compliment them by saying "That color looks good on you!" or "You look stunning!"., If they are a member, gift it to them. If they are a nonmember, ask if they can put something on trade and trade it to them. What accessories do they want? Ask them. It's always nice to get things, but it's even nicer to give things. If they want a head flower, give them a head flower that looks good with their outfit. Before you give it to them, put it on your animal and ask them "Do you want this?" just to make sure. If not, recycle it and get something they'd like. If they do, give it to them and compliment them by saying "That really matches!" or "That looks good with your dress!", Ask them which color they want and start painting. If they want a pattern, pretend to go get nail stencils ans ask them what color they want their pattern to be. Get that color and do your magic! Do a special marble effect, add cute little nail decals, and cut their nails! They'll adore their new fancy nails., Ask them which color and then apply the makeup on them. Do they want lipstick, mascara, or eye shadow? Do they want green contacts to match their green nails? Do it for them! For the girly girl, pink shades are their best friend. If your customer isn't the "girly girl" type, some blues, greens, or browns would look great on them. Be sure to avoid turning your customer into a clown- remember, not too much makeup! Ask them what makeup they can wear to make sure they aren't allergic to what you are using., Welcome them in your salon. Then let the look around top see the things they can do. Offer them some jobs that they might like doing. They will say something from the list down below: \n Greeting the customers sounds fun! \n I'd love to advertise your salon and give away magazines! \n Entertaining people in the waiting room suits me. \n Tell them the things from "Operating the Salon" above. Check on them every once in a while to make sure they are doing their job. If they are doing it correctly, everyone should be happy and satisfied! Be sure to share your earnings with the employees so they don't quit., Give them breaks and let them chat for a while when they are not needed (for example: nobody is coming to the salon so the greeter doesn't need to greet people.). Provide food for the employees when they are on their break., Add some pizazz in and say "Salon my den! It's epic!". Just adding "It's epic!" makes jammers think it really is. Add things like "It's huge", "It's about to get full", "Hurry before I leave", "Very spacious", and "It has good reviews". Just remember whatever you say, people believe you. Ever wonder why people get scammed? It's because they believe what people say!, That's one of the worst and most annoying problems in Animal Jam. Why? Because most of the time, people who lock their den are trolling other people to click on their name tag for nothing. Make sure to keep your den unlocked so nobody thinks you are trolling them., That's also very annoying. Why? Same as above! You see an awesome salon being advertised, but the person advertising it is moving around like crazy or their name tag is covered by the crowds of Jamaa, so either way, you can't click! So annoying..., Your den will most likely be full. But, it may be super laggy and hard to type and hard for people to click your name tag. Instead of going into a full world, go into a world that has 3 green dots or 2 green dots. A better way to solve this is to go from world to world gathering jammers. Since spas are so rare in AJ, your den should be full in a few minutes (if people don't keep leaving, darn jammers!).

 In order to practice pyrography, you'll want a few basic tools to get you started. After you've successfully completed a couple of drawings, you may want to expand, although you're be perfectly able to get by with the following: \n Wood burning pen. These basically come in two varieties: the 'every-man's' soldering iron style machine with one heat setting as well as interchangeable brass tips, and the higher-end wire pen with two styluses and different heat settings. You can get a decent soldering iron style pen for $20+, while the more versatile wire pens sell for hundreds of dollars.Assorted wood burning tips. These will allow you greater leeway to produce lighter/heavier marks, as well as different patterns. \n Strop and aluminum oxide to periodically clean off the brass tips of the wood burning pen. \n Pliers. \n Clay pot or pen holder (for safety when element is still hot).\n The hardness of wood is rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the softest wood (like Balsa) and 10 being the hardest (like Padauk). For beginners, especially, the softer the wood, the better. Hard woods are expensive, resistant to heat, and generally on the darker side. Soft woods, on the other hand, are cheaper, easier to burn, and lighter, providing a good burn contrast. Try getting your hands on these soft woods as you start off wood burning: \n Pine \n Basswood \n Birch \n Ash \n Maple \n Your pen will get quite hot quite fast, so attach the tip you'll be working with before you turn on the machine. Always attach and detach tips with your pliers. Give your pen two or so minutes to get hot. As it heats up, let your wood burning pen rest in a pen holding device or a clay pot to minimize the risk of accidental burning. \n Take some 320 grit sandpaper, wrap it around a flat wooden block or attach to a paddle sander, and lightly hit all areas of the wood equally. Details will come out sharper and crisper when the surface of the wood is very smooth. \n When sanding, sand with the grain. The grain is the direction of the wood fibers. Sanding with the grain will minimize any tiny burrs or scratch marks that result from sanding against the grain. \n When you're done sanding, wipe the surface with a damp towel. This will remove any sawdust and make the outline transfer easier. \n Many beginners make the mistake of pressing down too hard on the wood with the pen, thinking that lots of pressure is needed to make an impression. It's not. In fact, using light strokes is preferable to pressing down hard. It's easier to guide the pen, reduces errors, and all but eliminates the possibility of accidental burning. \n You're not going to win any awards for racing through the design in record time. Wood burning, regardless of the material you're using, is a slow process. As you familiarize yourself with the pen, remember: \n Steady pressure is best. For most beginner designs, you'll want the indents etched by the pen to be even all around. \n The longer you hold your pen in one area, the darker and deeper it will get. \n Turn your piece of wood until most of the grain is pointing downward. This will make your job much easier, as you will be moving your pen in a downward direction most of the time, thereby burning with the grain. Burning against the grain will offer up more resistance. \n Once you have got your materials and you know the basics, get several pieces of practice wood and practice with the various tips that will come with your wood burner. Once you have a good idea of what each tip does, then you will know which ones to use for various projects. The tips you will use will depend upon what type of picture and how much detail you are going to put in the picture. \n If you are a killer artist and drawing is your thing, you may find it fun to draw directly onto the wood you're using with a graphite pencil. It's not the easiest, most efficient way of getting down an outline, but it sidesteps the lifeless, cookie-cutter stiffness that many artists unwittingly produce when copying directly from another image. \n Make or print out a sketch of your image. Place the graphite paper, face down, on top of the wood, secure it to the wood with a bit of masking tape, and your sketch on top of the graphite paper. Then with a 2B pencil, trace over the sketch with medium pressure and fluid lines. Remove the graphite paper and deepen the outline on the wood with the same 2B pencil. \n A transfer tip is a flat tip that uses heat to transfer the ink of a printed image directly onto the wood. Scan or find an imagine online that you'd like to use. Print out the image, preferably with a laser printer. Next, fasten the printed image to your wood with a clamp and begin to head up the transfer tip. Slowly, methodically, brush the back side of the paper — above where any ink is — with the transfer tip. Remove the paper and inspect your newly-transferred design. \n This only takes a second, and should be done often. If you're hunched over and burning perilously close to your belly, chances are it's going to be much harder to burn. \n This way, if you mess up, your flaw won't be pointing you straight in the face. Rest assured though — you can correct most mistakes by simply sanding them out. \n Remember, easy does it. You only want to apply light pressure so that you can stay nimble with your pen. Try to move the pen towards you, not away from you, as you begin to burn, with your wrist resting on the wood if possible. \n Burn over the outlines of your design first to get them set. \n If you want to try to make a wood burn image 3D instead of the customary 2D, you'll want to experiment with different tips — tips that express shades and textures. As always, a few hours of practice on the back of a scrap piece of wood will be invaluable when it comes to shading on the real deal. \n You are now ready to start adding color to your image. Color is optional and may look better on some images then on others. You will want to use water colors and a brush of your choice. (Watercolors pencils work especially well.) \n You can run your tips over a sanding block for a quick fix, or you can clean your (cooled off) tips on a strop using aluminum oxide. This removes excess carbon that sticks to the tips.Submerge your tips in cold water for a minute or two before touching if you're unsure how hot they are. Remember to use your pliers to safely detach any and all tips. \n Some woods give off more smoke than others, smoke which can be breathed in and become irritating to your lungs. To counteract this, put on a fan if you're working in an enclosed area. \n The last step is to put a wood finisher on your product. Let this dry thoroughly before your wood burning project is completely finished. \n 
 Some of these basics might include black trousers or slacks, a solid-colored skirt, a dark blazer or jacket or a white button-down shirt. When in doubt about your outfit, incorporating one or more of these professional basics will polish your look.\n Keep ear piercings simple, take out any facial or tongue piercings and cover tattoos with long sleeves or pants when you're dressing for work in human resources \n Remember that you're representing your company and keep your makeup understated and attractive. Your makeup can be unique as long as it's still professional. If you want to add more color, try adding it in moderation, like wearing colorful eyeshadow but skipping the bold lipstick. \n Avoid skirts with high slits or shirts with see-through material, as these might show too much skin or be too provocative for the workplace. \n A meeting with high-level international executives probably calls for a suit and jewelry, whereas a meeting with a small, grassroots or nonprofit group would allow you to dress more business casual. \n Being familiar with the expected dress code will help you choose clothing that meets your company's expectations for employee appearance. \n It's better to be a little overdressed or look more professional than necessary than to look overly casual or unprofessional. \n 
 Fix rusted area and coat with top grade primer or lead-based primer and paint, or coat with fiberglass resin. Mud is usually trapped under the fender wells on the upper light domes, fender ends, and on the Super Beetle, the top area of the front coil shock springs.\n Clean and coat rusted area of floor pan with top grade primer or lead-base paint. This is very important especially the rear floors and battery area. Replace tar paper rug with rubber mats (spike side of mat down.) Note: 72 VW Beetles and later models had no tar paper rugs. \n Coat body attachment area and metal part of running boards with fiberglass resin, and use a thin layer of fiberglass with resin at rust damaged areas. File and sand smooth all resin/fiberglass work. \n Use new original VW hoses or 3/16 diameter braided fuel hoses for replacement. \n Disassemble and pack all four c v joints with molybdenum disulphide lithium grease. Rotate the c v joints by installing the previous wheel c v joint to the inside transmission flanges, and installing the previous transmission c v joints to the outside wheel flanges. \n Coat brake line in this area with Rustoleum or lead-base primer and paint. \n Apply the brakes and have an assistant outside try to rotate the front left and right wheels. If one (or both) front wheel still rotates when the brakes are applied, check for faulty brake hose, brake cylinder or caliper, master cylinder, rubber grommet on Master cylinder where brake fluid enters for cracking or leakage, or brake shoes and linings. Apply (with force) and release brake and then check again for free rotation of front wheels. If one (or both) front wheels do not rotate freely, check for faulty brake hose, brake cylinder of caliper. NOTE: brake hose deteriorates from the inside and may look perfectly good on the outside. \n It assures the engine is not overstressed (lugged down,) and will not overheat due to faulty brakes. The engine will last longer and the car will get better gas mileage. \n Therefore, the brake procedure should also be performed when: the gas mileage drops; the car does not roll freely (coast) on the road, especially after releasing brakes; a wheel drum overheats, or smelling of burning brake shoes. \n 
 You can buy a plain one that is all one color. You can also buy a fancy one with a pattern on the cover. \n You can also use a 2-ring binder if you can't find a 3-ring binder.\n Paper stains easily in the kitchen. A plastic page protector will keep your recipes clean. The smooth surface is also easy to wipe clean. They are transparent plastic sleeves, about same size as a sheet of printer paper. Most will already have holes punched in the sides for the binder rings to go through. You can find them at office supply stores, and well-stocked arts and crafts stores., You might already have some in your home. You can also find plenty of recipes online and in magazines. Lastly, you can also ask your friends and family members if they have any recipes they would like to share with you. \n This will keep everything looking consistent. If you have beautiful handwriting, you can write the recipes out by hand instead. You can also use the original recipes if you don't care about consistency. \n Avoid adding page numbers if you plan on adding more recipes to the binder later. \n Use page numbers if you already have all the recipes you want and don't plan on adding anymore. \n If the recipe is a long one, print it out on a single page. If you have a few recipes that are short and very similar, try putting them on the same page. You can divide them into paragraphs or columns., If you cannot find any page protectors, try to order some online. You can also get the pages laminated at a photocopying shop. Once they are laminated, punch holes in them using a hole puncher., Having sections will make your recipe binder less overwhelming. They will also make your binder more organized and easier to browse. Here are some ideas for the different sections you could have in your binder: \n Appetizers \n Baked goods \n Desserts \n Drinks \n Entrees \n Favorites \n Salads \n Soups \n Treats \n You can design the title page using an image or word processing program. You can also design it right onto a sheet of paper. The title page should include the name of the section in large letters. You can also include a border and a table of contents that lists all the recipes in that section., Again, if you don't have any page protectors, try to get the pages laminated. Be sure to punch holes in the sides., The tabs should match the section title pages. For example, if you have a section title page for desserts, write "Desserts" on the tab., Stagger the tabs when you stick them down onto the pages. Each tab should be positioned a little bit lower than the previous tab. That way, you will be able to see all the tabs at once when you open the binder and look down at it., You can put them in any order you want, but make sure that they are under the right sections. \n Recipe binders make great gifts, especially if they are filled with treasured family recipes that have been passed down for generations. They can also make an ideal going-away-to-college gift. \n You can arrange your binder however you think would be the most helpful for you. This section will give you a few ideas on how to do this. You don't have to use all the ideas from this section., If you have a lot of recipes, you could divide them up further between several binders. For example, you can have a binder for baked goods and another one for salads. You could even have a special one just for family recipes., This means that if you have a section for pies, you might arrange your recipes like this: apple pie, blueberry pie, pecan pie, pumpkin pie, rhubarb pie, etc., This can help make your binder look more orderly. It can also help you find recipes quicker. Here are some ideas for you: \n Alphabetize the sections. For example: appetizers, beverages, cakes and cookies, desserts, pasta, poultry, salads, etc. \n Arrange the sections in the order you might eat a meal. For example: breakfast, lunch, appetizers, salad, main course, dessert, etc. \n This will make finding recipes a lot easier. \n Start by writing down the name of your recipe book in the top center of the page. Use a large, fancy font. \n Next, write down the names of the sections in a slightly smaller font. You can still use a fancy font. The section names should be on the left side of the page. \n Lastly, write down the names of the recipes in a smaller, but plain, font. Make sure that the recipes are under the right section. The recipes should also be on the left. \n If your binder has page numbers, write them down on the right side. The font should be the same as the one you used for the recipe names. \n If you think you might want to keep adding to your binder, it might be a good idea to include two or three extra pages at the end of each section. This way, if you come across a recipe you like, all you have to do it print it out or write it down. If you are using stationary paper, you won't have to worry about trying to find the same design again., These sections aren't based off of any regular food group, such as soups, salads, cakes, and so forth. They are unique and include dishes from multiple food groups. Here are some examples: \n Include some categories inspired by foods from different countries, such as: Chinese, French, Indian, Italian, Mexican, Thai, etc.Add a section for your favorite recipes. \n Put all of the recipes you are interested in trying out in their own section. \n Have a special section for holiday recipes. This will make finding all of those recipes for Thanksgiving a lot easier., Sometimes, you run out of a certain ingredient and don't have the time to run to the store. Research some common substitutions, and print them out onto a sheet of paper. Add this to the back of your binder.Some common cooking substitutions include margarine for butter and white vinegar for lemon juice. \n You can also include a section for healthy substitutions, such as wheat flour for white flour, or apple sauce instead of oil/butter., This will come in handy if you are living in the UK and are working with a US recipe, and vice versa. It will also come in handy when you need to measure out liters using cups instead., You can also just use an empty page protector. This is great for those recipes you are not sure about and don't want to put the effort into printing them out just yet., You can tape it to the back of your binder. You can also keep it in its own page protector. This will allow you to keep track of what recipes you have tried and didn't like, so you can avoid using them in the future., You can leave your binder as is, or you can add some special touches to it. This section will give you some ideas. You don't have to use all of the ideas from this section, however. Use the ones you like the most., Stationary paper usually has a pretty boarder. This can make your recipes more interesting to look at. \n Stationary paper also tends to come in different themes. Choose a theme you like. You can also match the theme to your binder. \n If you have a special section for holiday recipes, such as Thanksgiving or Christmas, try matching the paper to the holiday. For example, use paper that has pumpkins or autumn leaves for Thanksgiving recipes, and paper that has snowflakes or Christmas trees for Christmas recipes. \n You can add step-by-step pictures to your recipes. You could also add a picture of the final dish instead. This will make the recipes more colorful. The photos will also give you an idea of what the final dish is supposed to look like in the end., You can make a plain binder more interesting by decorating a sheet of paper, and slipping it behind the clear, protective cover. Here are some ideas to get you started: \n If you just want a fancy cover, use a sheet of scrapbook paper. You may have to trim it down a little in order to get it to fit. \n Give your binder a title. Write the title down on some paper and slip it behind the protective sheet on the cover. You call it anything you want, such as: You Name's Cookbook. \n Use an opaque fabric marker to draw designs on a fabric-covered binder. Most fabric markers come in opaque and transparent colors. Don't use a transparent fabric marker. The colors will blend right into the fabric and won't show up well. \n If your binder already has a pattern on it, you could use letter stickers to give it a title. \n This can be a nice way to introduce each section. Here are some ideas" \n If you have a salad section, add a picture of your favorite salad onto the title page. \n If you have a section for desserts or pastries, add a picture of a fancy cake or pie. \n If you have all of the recipes you want in that section, consider adding a mini table of contents. Right beneath the title, write down the names of all the recipes that are in that section. This will help remind you of what is in there. \n This will allow you to get a bit more creative, and match the design of the tab to the rest of your binder. Here's how to make one: \n Cut some colored paper into a ½ by 1 inch (1.27 by 2.54 centimeter) rectangle. \n Label the tab. \n Cut some clear packaging tape into a 1½ by 1½ inch (3.81 centimeter) square \n Place the ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) of the tape onto the side of the page protector. \n Place the tab under the tape. The long side of the rectangle should flush with the edge of the page protector. It should also be centered on the tape. \n Fold the tape over and press it down onto the back of the page protector. \n Using just a few items, you can make your own rustic recipe binder. Here's what you will need:2 sheets thin cardboard or illustration board \n Printer paper \n 2 – 3 binder rings \n Markers or letter stickers \n Make sure that they are the same size. These will be the front and back cover of your binder., The paper you are using should be a little bit smaller than the covers., You will need two to three holes. The top and bottom hole should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the top and bottom of the covers., Place the back cover down on a table in front of you, then stack the recipe pages on top of it. Place the front cover on top. Align the holes as best you can., Close the binder rings once all the pages, including the covers, are on them. You can buy binder rings from an office supply store or an arts and crafts store., Write a title using marker or letter stickers. You can also draw on a border using markers or glitter paint., Because the binder is made from paper, you will have to take extra care of it. If you are worried about it getting dirty, consider keeping it in a box or in a cupboard.
\n Do you want the primal reversion of Groudon or Kyogre? Look up the special events available for the game, and think about which ones you want most. \n Did you play the original games? If you did, which one did you like best? And if you only played one, why not give the other a whirl? \n Discuss who is getting which game and why. Pay attention to each argument presented. Notice the points people have for choosing either Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire. \n For example, Reshiram is exclusive to Omega Ruby, while Zekrom is exclusive to Alpha Sapphire. You can check out the exclusives here: http://ie.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire/Version_Differences \n Choose the Pokémon you prefer. \n If you cannot come to a conclusion, give yourself to the spontaneous moment, and choose as you go to buy it. \n If you have no idea what to do and you think the games are perfectly equal, flip a coin. \n Don't get all down if you pick the wrong one; just remember you will have fun either way! \n You get both Rayquaza and Deoxys, along with many other legendary Pokémon. Which one you choose is up to you. \n This may not seem like a big deal, but if you have friends that also play, it's always fun to have a common enemy. \n If so, it's nice to get the remake of the one you originally had or your favorite out of the three if you had Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald. Why not get a fun remake of your childhood memories? \n Each individual Pokémon has a different way of battling! \n If a friend already has Omega Ruby, consider getting Alpha Sapphire. That way, you can trade Pokémon you each need. \n 
 It's a good idea to have someone to help you — either an experienced horse person or your veterinarian. You should certainly have an experienced professional supervise you the very first time you give an injection. If your veterinarian can't make the trip, see if a vet tech can help you out.\n A needle-shy horse will be able to tell what you're up to, even if he can't see the needle! He'll act up even before getting the shot because he knows what's coming and wants to prevent it. These behaviors can include rearing, biting, and kicking. For everyone's safety in this situation, it's best to have a professional do the job. \n If you lack experience, you could end up hurting the horse, even if you escape injury yourself. There's a good chance the needle could bend, possibly while still in the horse. This could damage the horse's muscle, and might even call for surgical removal. \n For example, some horse tranquilizers can cause respiratory arrest (stop breathing) in humans. \n Even sticking the needle through a stopper on a medicine bottle dulls the point a bit. This, in turn, makes the injection more painful for the horse. The needle needs to be as sharp as possible to penetrate the horse's skin quickly and easily. If you encounter a needle-shy horse, he may be that way because of the pain associated with a blunt needle in the past. \n Because muscles have a good blood supply, the medicine is absorbed into the blood stream nicely. \n Some medications may sting when given IM. The packaging for these products might recommend against giving the medicine through an IM shot. On the other hand, some IM injections contain preservatives that are not suitable for injection into a blood vessel. \n It's not likely you'll have to give an intravenous injection. Do not attempt one, though, unless you are a qualified veterinarian or vet tech. \n The two most common sites for giving an injection are the neck and hindquarters. Either site is fine — location is largely a matter of your personal preference. That said, it's best to inject skittish horses in the neck, as you can't get kicked from that position. The large muscle of the hindquarters are better if you need to deliver a large volume of medication (10 ml or more), though.Always check with your vet or the directions on the medication packaging for the recommended injection site. \n The person helping you (the handler) should stand on the same side as of the horse as you. The horse's head should be slightly turned toward the handler. This decreases the chances of someone getting run over or stepped on if the horse reacts badly during the injection process. \n It's best not to tie the horse. A big physical reaction could hurt either the horse or the handlers, or damage the equipment. \n Have your handler speak soothingly to the horse while you position yourself by the injection site.If the horse remains restless, try using a twitch to keep him still during the injection. While it may look uncomfortable, a twitch is perfectly safe and humane, and is widely used to ease stress in horses. The most common type of twitch is a loop of rope attached to a pole. \n Place the horse's upper lip in the loop of rope. \n Tighten the loop by rotating the pole round and round. \n This gentle compression of the upper lip has a calming effect, like when a mother cat picks up a kitten by the scruff. \n It is best to have your handler operate the twitch, leaving your hands free to give the injection. \n One of your main concerns when injecting a horse should be the safety of all involved. When injecting at the neck, you stand in a fairly safe position beside the horse's shoulder — far from kicking back hooves. You also have more control of the horse, as well, since you're by his head. All told, neck injections just provide a safer environment than hindquarter injections, and are a good option. \n Locate the triangle between the point of the horse's shoulder and the slope of the shoulder blade. The upper side of the triangle is the "nuchal ligament" — the arc of muscle along the top of the horse's neck. The lower side of the triangle is formed by the neck bones as they snake upwards from the shoulder in an "S" shape. \n To find this triangle, put the heel of your hand against the front of the horse's shoulder, about a third of the way up the neck. \n Where your palm rests is the safe place to give the injection. \n If you give the injection too high up the neck, the medicine will enter the nuchal ligaments that hold the head up. This is extremely painful for the horse, and will continue to cause him pain every time he moves his head. But if you go too low, the needle may glance off the bones of the neck vertebra, which is also painful for the horse. \n You could also hit the jugular vein if you go too low. If you're delivering a medication unsuitable for intravenous use, the horse could die. \n This injection site is more effective than the neck, but also more dangerous because you have to stand closer to the back end and the danger of being kicked. However, the hindquarters are the preferred location if you have to deliver a large volume of medication (10 ml or more). For example, penicillin comes in large doses. \n Your target muscle for this type of injection is the "semitendinosus muscle," which is at the very back of the horse's rump. Imagine a horse sitting down like a dog — the semitendinosus muscle is the one he would sit on. In foals, this is one of the largest muscles in the body, which adds to its appeal for IM injections. \n Begin by finding the point of the buttocks (the bony bit far back on the pelvis). Drop an imaginary vertical line down to the ground, along the back of the leg. You will give the injection into the bulging muscle located along this line. \n Take care to inject into the muscle, not into the "dip" where the muscle buts against a neighboring one. \n The "dip" is low in blood vessels. Medicine injected there will not be absorbed well, and will be less effective. \n But, the blood supply to this area isn't particularly good, so medicine may be less effective when injected there. Furthermore, if an abscess forms at the needle site, it can be hard to drain off and get rid of. \n Only inject in the top of the rump if you have no other options. \n Some people like to tap the horse a few times at the injection site, but this is a bad idea. Taps are fast, punch-like blows given with the heel of the hand before the needle's inserted. Some believe it numbs the skin so the horse won't feel the needle. But, tapping only warns the horse that something is about to happen — especially if you've used that technique before. The horse will be calmer if he doesn't know what's about to happen. \n When you first insert the needle, you want to do it without the medicine attached to it. This will allow you to "draw back" and make sure you've placed the needle accurately. \n Using a sharp, new, sterile needle for each injection, push the needle into the muscle in a smooth, confident motion. The needle should form a 90° angle with the muscle. Insert the needle all the way up to the hub (the part where the metal needle joins onto the syringe). \n Many medications can be dangerous for the horse if delivered into a blood vessel. In worst case scenarios, it can result in death. To avoid this, always "draw back" before giving an injection. This simple action makes sure your needle is in the muscle, not a blood vessel. \n Once you've inserted the needle into the injection site, pull back on the syringe plunger a little bit. \n If the needle is in a blood vessel, you'll see blood getting pulled into the needle hub (the bit left sticking out of the skin). \n Remove the needle and do NOT inject. \n Use a new, sharp needle to find the injection site again, then repeat the drawing back process until you're confident you're in the right place. \n Draw back on the plunger one more time to double-check for the presence of blood. If all is clear, then press steadily onto the plunger to give the injection. Once the syringe is empty, withdraw the syringe and needle together. \n A blob of blood might form in the needle hole in the horse's skin. If so, apply gentle pressure with a ball of cotton wool for at least two minutes. By that time, the bleeding should have stopped, but if not, keep holding the wool against the wound until it does. \n Once used, they're considered "clinical waste," which means you can't just throw them in the trash. You have to dispose of them in a way approved by local authorities. \n Store used needles and syringes in a plastic container with a lid. An empty ice-cream tub or similar container will be just fine. \n Give the container to your veterinarian for safe disposal at the clinic. \n Make sure to keep the container out of reach from children while the needles are in your care. \n 
\n The skin and bone adds thickness to the chicken breasts, essentially doubling the amount of time they need to cook. \n These strips of chicken are very thin, so they usually finish cooking in 10 minutes or less. This amount of time also applies to boneless chicken breast cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. \n The addition of a bone adds more cooking time to this cut. Moreover, as dark meat, thighs need to cook for a little longer than breasts. \n Since drumsticks have less meat on them than thighs, they do not usually need to cook for quite as long. \n Add another 10 to 20 minutes onto the cooking time for each additional 1 lb (450 g). \n The exact size stockpot you need may vary depending on how large your chicken pieces are and how much room they take up inside the pot. As a general rule, the chicken should take up roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of the space in your stockpot. \n An 8-quart (8-liter) stockpot is fairly standard and will usually be enough to hold a whole chicken. A larger stockpot may be needed for birds bigger than 4 lb (1800 g), though. \n You can use an 8-quart (8-liter) stockpot for boneless chicken breasts, but you could also opt for a smaller stockpot so that the water will boil faster. \n Pour enough cold water into the stockpot to cover the chicken completely. \n Cold water is preferable to warm water. \n You can sprinkle anywhere from 1 tsp (5 ml) to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt into the water. A smaller amount is better for boneless chicken breasts and chicken tenders, but a larger amount may be better for whole chickens. \n Note that the salt is only optional. You could boil the chicken without salt, but it will be much blander as a result. \n Cover the stockpot and boil the chicken on medium heat. Follow the recommended cooking time listed in this article for your cut of chicken. \n Place enough chicken broth into your stockpot to fill the stockpot halfway. \n Chicken broth intensifies the flavor of the chicken, so it becomes less bland than chicken boiled in water. \n You can use pre-made broth, but if you do not have pre-made broth, you can combine chicken broth granules with water. You usually need 1 tsp (5 ml) or one cube of chicken bouillon per 1 cup (250 ml) of water. \n Use chicken stock instead of broth for an even richer, deeper flavor. \n Cutting the vegetables up allows more of the flavor to seep into the cooking liquid. \n Peel the onions and cut them into halves or quarters. \n Wash the carrots with water and slice them into 1-inch (2.5-cm) coins. \n Rinse the celery and cut it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) slices. \n Transfer the chopped vegetables to the stockpot. The vegetables add dimension to the flavor of the broth. \n Strictly speaking, the vegetables are not needed. Chicken can be boiled in plain broth. \n Transfer the chicken to the stockpot. If necessary, add more broth or water to the stockpot so that the chicken is completely covered. \n Bring the broth the a boil over high heat. Cover the pot, and reduce the heat to medium or medium-low so that the chicken simmers slowly. \n Cook according to the recommended cooking times listed in this article. \n Remove the chicken with tongs or a slotted spoon when done. \n If desired, strain the cooking liquid and save the broth as stock for future recipes. You can store stock in the refrigerator for 3 days or in the freezer for 2 months. \n You will likely end up discarding the vegetables used in this recipe, since the texture will turn mushy. The primary purpose of the vegetables in this recipe is to add flavor, not to serve as a side dish. \n Pile the chicken into your stockpot and cover with enough water and apple juice to completely cover the chicken. \n For a stronger apple flavor, pour 2 quarts (2 liters) of apple juice into the stockpot before filling the rest of the stockpot up with enough water to cover the chicken. \n For a more subtle apple flavor, pour equal parts apple juice and water into the stockpot simultaneously. \n You could also use apple cider instead of apple juice. Apple cider tends to have a sharper taste, which some find preferable to the milder taste of apple juice. \n Make sure that the combination of chicken, water, and apple juice fills between 1/2 and 3/4 of the stockpot. \n The savory taste of the vegetables in this recipe balances out the natural sweetness of the apple juice. \n Peel the onion and cut it into halves or quarters. \n Rinse the carrots under running water and cut them into 1-inch (2.5-cm) coins. \n If using cloves of garlic, mince 4 cloves of garlic. If using garlic powder, use 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of the seasoning. \n You can use anywhere between 1 tsp (5 ml) and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) chopped fresh thyme. If using dried thyme, cut this down to 1/3 the amount. \n Disperse the onion, carrots, garlic, and thyme in the apple juice mixture. \n Bring the liquid up to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat so that the liquid only simmers, then cover and let cook according to the amount of time indicated in the "cooking times" section. \n About 10 minutes before the chicken finishes cooking, begin preparing the apple. Peel the apple, core it, and cut it into small slices. \n The addition of the apple near the end of the cooking time will infuse an even stronger apple flavor into the chicken. \n Strain out the chicken when done and serve without any of the vegetables, fruit, seasonings, or cooking liquid. \n The other ingredients serve to infuse the chicken with flavor as it cooks. The ingredients themselves, however, will be too soft and mushy to be very appetizing at this point. \n Add the dry white wine and chicken broth first. Then, fill the pot with enough water to reach the halfway point. \n Wine can infuse chicken meat with a tremendous amount of flavor, but using too much could be overpowering. \n Only use chicken broth in equal parts with the wine. Otherwise, the flavor of the chicken broth could end up competing with the flavor of the wine. \n Dilute with water only as necessary. \n Toss the pearl onions, salt, pepper, garlic, parsley, oregano, and thyme into the cooking liquid. \n Pearl onions do not need to be cut beforehand. \n If you do not have pre-minced garlic on hand, you could mince or crush 6 cloves of garlic instead. \n If using fresh herbs, add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of each herb. For dried herbs, cut this amount down to 1 tsp (5 ml) each. \n Bring the cooking liquid up to a boil over medium-high heat. Let sit at this temperature for 2 to 5 minutes before reducing to a simmer. \n Doing this allows some of the flavor of the seasoning to be released and some of the bitterness of the wine to cook off. \n Add the chicken to the cooking liquid using tongs. Bring the liquid back up to a boil before reducing the heat again. \n Cover the stockpot and boil the chicken at a steady simmer for the recommended cooking time indicated. \n Serve the chicken only. The liquid and other ingredients are meant to add flavor, not to be served alongside the chicken. \n
 Gluten is found in foods made with grains, like breads, pastas and snacks containing wheat, rye,barley and malt. The gluten in oats is still under investigation as to whether is has the same effect on the body. Any kind of flour can contain gluten. \n Some foods you can eat are those made of corn, buckwheat, nuts and legumes, rice, potato, and millet. \n The obvious offenders are breads and pastas, but beer, various condiments, boxed foods and bakery items may contain gluten as well. \n With the new requirements of listing allergy information on labels, all products containing wheat or gluten should be advertised as such. Look for the nutrition box on the packaging; the ingredients list and allergy information are usually in the same vicinity. Read all the fine print. \n This is important because some processed foods like bouillon cubes, french fries, and even soy sauce may contain gluten. \n If you don't see any, ask your server if there are any dishes that aren't made with gluten. If your server doesn't know, the chef or manager on duty should be able to find the information for you. Your knowledge of gluten products will come in handy here. \n If you do not do so you run the risk of developing severe and potentially life-threatening complications such as other autoimmune disorders, intestinal cancer, anemia, liver disease, hypoglycemia, and bone diseases. \n You may be able to participate in a clinical trial as well. A daily multivitamin can help give you the nutrients you need. In rare cases your doctor may prescribe corticosteroids like prednisone. \n You can find one online or ask your doctor if he knows of any local groups. \n The Celiac Disease Foundation, Celiac Sprue Association, and the Gluten Intolerance Group are some examples of the many support groups you can join. \n Keeping a food journal will help you pinpoint triggers. This will help you eliminate problem foods. \n The typical symptoms of Celiac disease in children include constipation, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea and vomiting, indigestion and decreased appetite leading to weight loss, lactose intolerance, intermittent diarrhea, and stools that are smelly, bloody, and "fatty". \n Adults are less likely to experience symptoms that are digestive in nature. Instead the disease may present in the form of unexplained iron-deficiency anemia, seizures, osteoporosis, missed menstrual periods, infertility, tingling and numbness of the extremities, and a skin rash called dermatitis herpetiformis. \n
 You lose weight when you burn more calories than you eat, so an inactive person who eats a lot of food will likely gain weight. The first step to losing weight is eating fewer calories. Track how many calories you eat in a day by writing down calorie information on all the food and drinks you consume. For foods that don't have nutrition labels, use the USDA Food Database to look up how many calories the item has.Find out how many calories your body needs to maintain your current weight by using an online calculator that takes your activity level into account. Try this one online www.bmrcalculator.org/. \n A pound of fat has 3,500 calories in it.To lose a pound of fat each week, every day you should eat 500 calories less than what your body needs to maintain its current weight.\n When you eat too much food, your body turns it into fat and stores it for future use. Read food labels to find out what an appropriate serving size should be. If you want to eat something without a label, check the American Dietetic Association Food Exchange list for proper serving sizes.Use measuring cups and a kitchen scale to make sure your servings match the recommended portion size. \n Restaurants can be tricky because they usually serve extremely large portion sizes. Some restaurants post their nutrition information online, though. If possible, check the nutrition information beforehand and plan a meal between 500–600 calories. \n Remember that you never have to eat the whole plate. Eat half your food to reach your calorie goal, then save the rest for later. You may be able to ask your server to put half of your meal in a to-go box before bringing out your food. \n Some restaurants also have lighter menu options or half-portion sizes of their larger meals. Order off of this lighter menu whenever possible. \n Healthy fats like unsaturated oils should be the primary fat source in your diet. Cook with olive or canola oil instead of butter or lard. Other sources of healthy fats include nuts, seeds, avocados, fish, and natural peanut butter. Don't eat anything that has trans fat or lists the words “partially hydrogenated” in the ingredients list. You should avoid saturated fats as much as possible, limiting them to less than 10% of your total calories. \n To calculate total calories from saturated fat, multiply the grams of fat by nine. For example, a food item with 5 grams of saturated fat has 45 calories from saturated fat. \n Divide these calories by your total calories for the day, then multiply by 100. You want this final number to be less than 10. \n For example, if I ate 210 calories from saturated fat and 2,300 calories for the day, I would have eaten 9% of calories from saturated fat. \n Processed foods go through some type of processing in a factory, and are usually found packaged in boxes, cans, bags, or other packaging. Often (although not always) they are higher in fat, sugar, and salt that can prevent you from losing weight. They also can lack a lot of the nutrients found in whole foods. Slowly eliminate processed foods from your diet by cutting two to three processed items per day. Replace them with whole foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. \n Highly processed foods are an indicator it may be high in undesirable food qualities. \n But just because a food is processed does not necessarily mean that is the case. There are many foods that are in packages that are quite good on a healthy diet, such as frozen vegetables, frozen fish fillets, or popcorn. \n Also be aware that food that did not come from a bag, box, or the like may still be unhealthy. A chocolate brownie made from organic ingredients from scratch is still a brownie. \n At the store, avoid the processed foods in the aisles by mainly shopping the perimeter, where the produce, dairy, meat and seafood, and bakery are. Only choose select items that are low-processed from aisles like the cooking aisle. \n Make meals from scratch ahead of time and freeze them into portion sizes to be eaten during the week. Homemade soups with tons of vegetables are a great freezer option.Look for foods that have three or fewer ingredients on the ingredients list to avoid highly processed items. \n It has many health benefits, including keeping your digestive tract healthy, and keeping you feeling full longer so you don't overeat. Fiber is found in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and nuts and seeds. Eat 25-30 grams of fiber each day with plenty of water. \n Fruits that are high in fiber include raspberries, blackberries, mango, and guava. \n Vegetables that are high in fiber include split peas, lentils, artichokes, and broccoli. \n Water is a major player in weight control. It helps flush metabolic waste out of your system, keeping your metabolism running high to quickly burn fat. Water will also keep you feeling full so you don't overeat. The adequate intake for men is 3 liters of water each day (about 13 cups) while women should drink 2.2 liters per day (about 9 cups). \n If you take part in high activity exercise or cardio during the day or live in a very hot climate, you may need to increase your water intake. \n Instead of eating three large meals each day, eat six smaller ones. Your body can process food better in smaller amounts, resulting in less excess food being stored as fat. This can also steady your blood sugar levels and improve your absorption of vitamins and minerals.Just make sure these smaller meals are are made up of healthy, whole foods instead of processed food. You might consider this sample meal plan: \n Meal #1 (8 a.m.): One medium banana with ½ cup of oatmeal. \n Meal #2 (10 a.m.): A smoothie made with 1 cup of spinach, four medium strawberries, ⅓ cup of raspberries, 1 tbsp of flaxseed, and 8 fl oz of unsweetened almond milk. \n Meal #3 (12 p.m.): One slice of whole wheat toast topped with one boiled egg and ¼ cup of mashed avocado. \n Meal #4 (3 p.m.): 1 cup of salad topped with ½ avocado, ¼ cup cottage cheese, 2 tbsp of sunflower seeds, and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. \n Meal #5 (5 p.m.): 4 oz of baked chicken with a side of green beans and ½ cup of brown rice. \n Meal #6 (7 p.m.): ½ cup of cooked quinoa mixed with sautéed mushrooms and pepper. \n To achieve the best fat-burning results, start out by exercising for two hours and 30 minutes each week, then increasing it by 30 minutes every week. Combining both weightlifting and high intensity cardio is the best way to maximize fat-burning. Consider following this sample four-week workout schedule: \n Sundays: Week One — 45 min. Cardio; Week Two — 45 min. Cardio; Week Three — 60 min. Cardio; Week Four — 60 min. Cardio \n Mondays: OFF all four weeks \n Tuesdays: Week One — 30 min Strength Upper Body; Week Two — 45 min Strength Upper Body; Week Three — 45 min Strength Upper Body; Week Four — 60 min Strength Upper Body \n Wednesdays: OFF all four weeks \n Thursdays: Week One — 45 min Cardio; Week Two — 45 min Cardio; Week Three — 60 min. Cardio; Week Four — 60 min. Cardio \n Fridays: OFF all four weeks \n Saturdays: Week One — 30 min Strength Lower Body; Week Two — 45 min Strength Lower Body; Week Three — 45 min Strength Lower Body; Week Four — 60 min Strength Lower Body \n Strength exercises can be done with weights, resistance bands, or just using your body weight. Try mixing up strength training exercises that work different muscle parts in the body. Start out at a slightly difficult weight or resistance and do three sets of 10 for each exercise or until failure. Once you can do that weight three workouts in a row (full three sets of 10) without failing, increase the weight or resistance by one level. \n Exercises for the lower body include squats, calf raises, lunges, deadlifts, and leg press. \n Upper body exercises include push-ups, sit-ups, chest press, overhead press, bicep curls, tricep dips, and lateral pull-downs. \n Cardio speeds up fat-burning, but it also has many other health benefits including decreasing your risk of cardiovascular disease. \n Running, jogging or walking: If you start out walking, make it your goal to work up to jogging, then running. \n Enjoy outdoor activities like sports, swimming, hiking, and biking. \n If you belong to a gym, use its treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and stair climbers. \n Try interval exercises, like multiple sprints with jogging in between. \n Switch between high intensity cardio and slower/longer endurance cardio for maximum fat burning. \n This is because lack of sleep causes changes in metabolism and fat-burning.These tips can help you get a good night’s sleep:Make sure the room is completely dark with dark curtains or sheets over the window. \n Do not eat for at least two hours before going to bed in order to prevent heartburn or an increase in energy when you are trying to go to sleep. \n Only use your bed for sleeping and sex. Do not do other activities such as watching TV, reading, listening to music, or working on the computer while you are in bed. \n Making small lifestyle changes throughout the day will help make your new habits stick. In the end, you will have made a positive change to a healthier lifestyle that you will be able to maintain long-term. Some small gestures you can make throughout the day to make a healthy lifestyle change include: \n Take the stairs instead of the elevator. \n Park in the back of the parking lot. \n Start a hobby that involves you moving around, like hiking or biking. \n Go to a weekly farmer’s market to buy fresh produce. \n Start a garden of your own. \n 
 Satellite radio in the US now offers stations from Quebec. Some cable TV companies offer TV5 or other French stations. \n You can also find a pen pal or an online community that will let you ask questions and talk to others who are learning French. \n Online meeting are available which may help you with this. \n Some high schools offer adult education classes in languages. \n Bayard Presse Jeunesse and Express Milan have websites which will show you quite a few offerings. Kids magazines are helpful because they have pictures, from which you can sometimes glean the meaning of words you don't yet know. They offer short and very short articles, which is helpful when you are very new to a language. \n Museums in all three regions have bilingual exhibits and creative technologies which will offer you some good practice. While you are there, you can buy some books or other materials, and you will find yourself surrounded by French speakers, particularly outside of Montreal. Keep in mind though that you the farther you go from the Montreal you travel, you will find more people using French which is not as easily recognizable as international French. For example, in Québec's Gaspesie region, many heritages have influenced the development of language over the centuries, as many of the original settlers came from the Guernsey and the Jersey Islands, and not from France. The French dialects spoken in New Brunswick and Louisiana fall under the umbrella "Acadian French", and have local colour and unique differences of their own. \n Learn the written form of common French words for daily use. \n You can try watching a DVD, but change the language to French. If you are just starting out, you may want to add English subtitles. As you get better, change to French subtitles, and eventually no subtitles. Remember that the point of this exercise is to practice listening, so try not to just read the subtitles. \n Practice using these words in a day-to-day situation. \n Buy or borrow a computer game which can be listened to in French as well as English. Caillou has such a game, but this is offered only as an example. Others are probably occasionally available. Read the boxes and see what you can find. \n It should sound like an abrupt 'No' in a French Accent. \n Parlez-vous anglais? (Do you speak English?) \n Comment ça va? (How are you?) \n Au Revoir (Goodbye) \n Chaud (Hot) \n Froid (Cold) \n Comment t'appelles-tu? / Comment vous appelez-vous?(What's your name?) \n Bonne Chance! (good luck!) \n C'est La Loi (it's the law) \n \n Deux (two) \n Trois (three) \n Quatre (four) \n Cinq (five) \n Six (six) \n Sept (seven) \n Huit (eight) \n Neuf (nine) \n Dix (ten) \n Also, tu is singular, and vous is plural. If you are addressing more than one person, use vous. \n Je suis chaud is quite rude in French. Use "J'ai" instead - I have. J'ai froid -> I'm cold; and J'ai chaud -> I'm hot. \n Just get a recording and repeat the words on the tape, and memorize what they mean. \n 
\n If you have a lot of layers when you save as a .pob file it can get quite large. On the other hand, if you want people to be able to move those new layers you made, let them be. \n Be sure NOT to merge the background layer or the template layers. \n Click on a tool, set the controls, and use your mouse to add the embellishments. \n Remember there will be a photo in place of the template layer later on. \n \n Again now you have a lot of choices as to what you want to use as your frame, textures, gradients, etc. but here the primary color will be set to white and the size to 10. \n \n Now, you should have a couple of nice frames around your template layers. \n Once you are finished with all your embellishments it's time to go to the top menu, 'File' and 'Save as'. \n this way you or others can open it in Photobie whenever you like and either change things or just add photos to your template layers. \n Now whenever you or someone else opens this Photobie file with the template layers it will be easy to just swap out the red circle and square layers with a photo. \n This is your circle shaped template layer. \n \n This will bring up the 'Template replace panel'. \n \n Once you find your image and click 'open' you will see it in the Template replace panel. \n (Watch the black borders to judge the size and placement.) \n
, Pin exactly on the line and fold the cream fabric back. Is it covering the outer lines? If not then reposition or cut a larger piece and try again. \n \n Press open. Repeat for the other cream piece and press well. Remove the papers if using., Our version has matching fabrics but you could mix and match if you wanted.\n Four 3-3⁄4in squares of dark red. \n One 2-3⁄4in square in cream for centre. \n Repeat for the other two sides., Cut two in half on the diagonal for the centre unit \n One 2-3⁄4in square in cream for centre. \n Pair the squares RS together with a dark red square and sew 1⁄4in away from the line on both sides., These are half square triangle units. \n Piece the half square triangle units into blocks of four with all the triangles pointing the same way as shown in the pictures., Measure the length of your table and add narrow sashing strips between the blocks if needed to bring the length to match your table. Or you may need some extra blocks. \n Lay the backing WS up on the table and place the wadding and then the top RS up onto it. Pin or tack together. \n This top was quilted on the Super quilter using a monofilament thread and has vermicelli quilting on the red squares and a diamond pattern inside the diamonds. The cream areas were left unquilted. If you had less time for quilting you could just quilt in the ditch between the blocks. Add binding cut to required length., Using the template cut twenty four triangles in the red fabrics with a seam allowance and twelve pieces of wadding without seam allowance., Turn the right way out and poke the corners out. slip the wadding inside and ladder stitch the gap closed., Sew six small shirt buttons to the ends of the table runner on the WS and sew six corresponding button loops to the top row of triangles., End by passing through a large bead, a seed bead and then back up round the seed bead, back through the large bead and finally through the string of beads. Complete by sewing through a few times in the seam allowance. Make three of varying lengths for each end of the runner. Lay in pride of place on your table.
 For cooking pizza and cookies, the top rack in the center is the ideal location. For cooking bread, biscuits, and other items, the middle rack in the center is the better choice.\n Never put a cold pizza stone in a hot oven, as it can shatter due to thermal shock.In fact, make sure never to expose the pizza stone to rapid temperature shifts. Placing a frozen pizza on a pizza stone is almost as likely to result in a shattered stone as placing a cold stone in a hot oven. You're better off cooking your frozen pizza straight on the rack. \n Do not grease or oil. For breads and pizza crust, you may want to add a little cornmeal to aid removal. \n It can take a little finessing to get used to, but a pizza paddle is a useful instrument, especially for transferring uncooked pizza dough onto the stone. There are three different kinds of peels — short-handled wooden peels, long-handled wooden peels, and metal peels. For the average person cooking at home, the short-handled wooden peel will probably work best. \n If you don't want to use cornmeal under your dough, you can also use flour. Rice flour is a great way to ensure the dough doesn't stick to your paddle., You do not have to remove it at all, as it can add to a "brick oven effect" that actually helps your oven retain and spread heat more evenly. You can put cooking dishes, pots, pans, cookie trays, and so on right on the stone. \n Of course, only do this once you're sure the pizza stone is cool enough to handle. \n The pizza stone can be cleaned and rinsed entirely with water. With a clean sponge, wipe away any remaining food or grime using only water. Do not try to remove oils that build up — it is fully unnecessary. Leaving the oils on the stone actually helps season the stone, turning it into a slicker, more easy-to-use item. \n A simple once-over is probably more than enough. If you pizza stone happens to absorb too much moisture when it's soaking in the sink, it can crack the next time you heat it in the oven., Stains on your pizza stone are normal and almost unavoidable. Moreover, they're like a badge of honor, or experience points — something that you point to as a vindication of your cooking skills. \n You can house your pizza stone in the oven even as you bake other items. Just bake them on top of the stone itself. For heavier items, like a roast, move the pizza stone to the bottom rack before cooking. \n You should know how much space you have to work with before you select your stone. You'll be kicking yourself if you buy a stone and then realize that your oven isn't large enough for it. \n If you're a bottom line sort of person and only worried about the taste of your pizza, not the look of your stone, you can purchase a quarry stone for around $5 to $10. You can start your search at any home improvement store like Home Depot or Lowe's. \n Look for clay or shale tiles, specifically, when you search for your stone. Terracotta tile works really well, as does most any stone that is labeled "all natural clay and shale." \n Glazed quarry stones contain lead, which is poisonous and generally to be avoided in all cooking items., Although one larger stone may be more aesthetically pleasing, several smaller stones may be more versatile in the end. You can position several smaller stones on various racks on your oven; they'll absorb heat, meaning that you can turn off your oven and let the heat emanate from the stones without burning extra energy. With several smaller stones, the heat gets more evenly dispersed. \n Enjoy pizza, French bread, cookies, bagels, and much more. \n Cook for about five minutes. \n The half cooked crust should be much easier to slide off the peel and back into the oven despite the extra weight. \n 
 Your Betta may also have a paler hue than normal and white or cotton-like patches on his body. These are all signs of a fungal infection. Fungus can grow in tanks that are not treated with salt and Aquarisol once the tank water is added.The fungus can spread quickly from one infected fish to the other fish in the tank so it should be treated right away.\n This is a symptom of a bacterial infection called popeye. Your fish may have developed popeye due to dirty tank water, or due to a more serious illness like tuberculosis. Sadly, tuberculosis is not curable in fish and is fatal for Betta fish. Tuberculosis can cause curved spines (not to be confused with the natural "hump" that older bettas develop). , These are symptoms of dropsy, which is a bacterial infection in your fish’s kidneys. It can cause renal failure and fluid accumulation, or bloating. It often occurs in fish that are weakened due to poor water conditions or from eating contaminated food.Once your fish suffers from kidney failure as a result of fluid buildup, your fish will likely die. You can prevent your fish from contracting dropsy by not feeding him live worms or contaminated food. Aquarium salt baths can draw out fluid, and medicines can help. Since it's hard to know what medicines are appropriate, and usually dropsy worsens quickly, painlessly euthanizing is acceptable. \n This is a sign of fish ick or ich. The spots may be slightly raised and your fish will likely scratch against objects in the tank due to irritated and itchy skin. Your fish may also have respiratory issues and appear to gasp at the surface of the tank water. Ick attacks fish that are stressed due to irregular water temperature and pH fluctuations in the water., These are all signs of a bacterial infection that causes your fish’s fins, tail and mouth to rot. Fin rot typically occurs in fish who are bullied by other fish in the tank or who are injured by a fin-nipping tank mate. A poor tank environment can also contribute to the development of fin rot. However, if your fish is a crowntail, it is natural for him/her to have a shredded looking fin.Luckily, most Betta fish can regrow their tail and fins if fin rot is treated in time. However, your Betta fish’s tail and fins may not be as vibrant as they once were when they grow back. \n Some Betta fish can contract advanced body and fin rot when a case of regular fin rot goes untreated for a long period of time. Your fish may lose his fins and body tissue as the rot progresses. Once the rot eats your fish’s body tissues, it can be difficult to cure the advanced fin rot and your fish will essentially be eaten alive. \n This is a symptom of velvet, which is a parasite that is highly contagious. If your Betta has velvet, he may also clamp his fins close to his body, start to lose his color, have a lack of appetite, and may scratch against the sides of the tank or the gravel in the tank.As velvet is a highly contagious parasite, you should treat all the fish in your tank if one fish shows signs of velvet. \n These are signs of swim bladder disorder, a common illness among Betta fish. Swim bladder disorder is caused by overfeeding your Betta fish, leading to a swollen swim bladder that causes your fish to float on one side or the lie at the bottom of the tank because swimming becomes too difficult.Keep in mind swim bladder is easy to treat and does not hurt your fish, so you do not need to worry about your fish dying due to swim bladder. \n This is a symptom of anchor worms, which are small crustaceans that burrow into your fish’s skin and enter his muscles. They then release eggs in your fish before they die, leaving behind damage in your fish that can become infected.Your Betta can contract an external parasite like anchor worms due to exposure at the pet store, from his food, or from infected fish who are introduced to his tank. \n Your fish may also scratch against objects to try to remove the anchor worms, and the points where the anchor worms are attached to your fish may be swollen. \n If your Betta lives with other fish in a tank, use a clean Betta fish net to remove him from the tank and place him a smaller tank with the necessary filtration system. This will then allow you to treat the water and the tank for any diseases, without harming your fish. \n You should also check that the quarantine tank has the right water temperature for your Betta, between 78 degrees and 80 °F (26.7 °C)., You can find this treatment at your local pet store. You can also treat ich by raising the temperature of your tank if your tank is larger than five gallons. If your tank is smaller than five gallons, you should avoid raising the temperature as this can kill your Betta fish.Raise the tank temperature in large tank in increments to avoid shocking your Betta until it reaches 85 degrees. This will kill the ich parasite. \n If you have a small tank, clean your tank completely, do a full water change and treat the water with Aquarisol and aquarium salt. You can also move your Betta fish to a temporary container and raise the temperature of the water to 85 degrees to kill any remaining ich parasites before you introduce your Betta fish back to the tank. \n You can prevent the develop of ich by maintaining a consistent water temperature and cleaning the tank weekly. \n These medications can kill off the fungus and prevent your Betta from developing more fungus that can cause fin and tail rot. You should also clean the tank completely and do a complete water change. Treat the new water with ampicillin or tetracycline, as well as a fungus eliminator.You will need to do a tank cleaning and a full water change every three days, adding the medication in each water change, to kill the fungus for good. Once your Betta fish no longer appears to be losing tissue on his tail or fins, you can resume your normal tank cleaning schedule. \n You can use ampicillin to also treat Popeye in your Betta. Do a tank cleaning and full water change every three days, adding ampicillin with each water change. Your fish’s Popeye symptoms should disappear within one week. \n If your fish shows any signs of an external parasite such as anchor worms or velvet, you should change out at least 70% of the tank water. You will then need to treat the remaining water with BettaZing to kill any remaining parasites and their eggs.You can purchase BettaZing at your local pet store. \n Bettas have small appetites, so you should only give your fish a small meal once a day to avoid overfeeding him. Your Betta should be able to consume all the food in his tank within two minutes of being fed. Excess food in your fish’s tank can lead to poor water quality and make your Betta more susceptible to disease.You should feed your Betta a varied, high protein diet. Look for Betta approved foods at your local pet store, as well as frozen or processed tropical fish foods. \n It’s possible your Betta will contract a disease or infection at some point in his life span, so be prepared by having medications on hand to treat your Betta quickly and efficiently. Medications can be stressful for your Betta, and should only be used when you have confirmed your Betta has a specific disease or infection and medication is necessary to treat the issue. You can find Betta first aid kits at your local pet store. Your first aid kit should contain the following medications:BettaZing or Bettamax: These medications are anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, and anti-protozoan. They are useful for a number of issues, such as fungus and velvet parasites. You can also use this medication as a preventative measure if you are trying to get a Betta used to a new environment or every time you introduce a new Betta to your tank. \n Kanamycin: This antibiotic can be found at many fish stores and pet stores. It can used for serious bacterial infections. \n Tetracycline: This antibiotic is used to treat less serious bacterial infections like fungus. \n Ampicillin: This is a useful antibiotic for treating popeye and other infections. You can find this antibiotic in specialty fish stores and online. \n Jungle Fungus Eliminator: This is an anti-fungal treatment that works on several fungus infections and is useful to keep on hand as a Betta fish owner. \n Maracin 1 and Maracin 2: These medications come in hard tablet form and can be used to treat mild infections like fin and tail rot. However, the are not as effective as other medications to treat more serious infections. \n This will help to remove any waste buildup and any decaying organic matter from excess food and dead leaves or roots from plants. Doing a small partial water change weekly will also clean any toxins from the water and keep the water clean.Do not remove any of the aquarium plants or decorations from the tank or bowl. Removing or cleaning these items can kill the good bacteria that has been filtering through your tank and reduce the quality of your filtration system. As well, you do not need to remove your fish from the tank or bowl when you do a partial water change. This can stress out your fish and could expose him to harmful bacteria.You can use a siphon to suck up any gunk in the gravel and decorations. You should also use an algae scraper to remove algae on the surface of the tank or the tank ornaments before you remove any of the water.If your tank does not have a filter, start with clean water and test daily for ammonia. When the kit says there is ammonia, it's time for a water change. Getting a top cover for the bowl or a filter can reduce the water changes you will need to do and protect your fish from getting an infection or a disease.Check the water once a day to ensure it is not cloudy, foamy, or has an unusual odor. These could all be signs of a bacterial bloom and may require you to do a full water change.Doing this will prevent your Betta from developing any diseases or infections. \n Bacterial infections like fin and tail rot can be prevented by adding aquarium salt to your tank water. Unlike table salt, aquarium salt does not contain any additives like iodine or calcium silicate. (Don't use table salt!) Do not use Aquarium Salt or copper-based medicines if your tank also includes Mystery Snails, Apple Snails, Cory Cats or Corydoras, as they can not handle these medicines and may die. Nerite snails are salt-tolerant, however they may not be able to handle copper, so proceed carefully.Always follow the instructions on the package for dosage amounts. Usually, manufacturers recommend one tablespoon of aquarium salt per five gallons of aquarium water. \n 
 You need to trade Graveler with someone who has a game from the same Generation. For example, you can trade between Red and Blue (Generation I) or Diamond and Pearl (Generation III). You cannot trade between Blue and Pearl. \n You cannot use a DS to trade between Generation III games. This is due to the lack of a link cable port on the DS. \n If you are playing on an emulator, click here.\n This is required for trading in Generations I-IV. In Generation V and later, you can select any of your Pokémon. \n Make sure Graveler is not holding an Everstone. This prevents evolutions. \n How you connect varies depending on the system. \n Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance - Use a link cable to connect two of the systems. You cannot connect different versions of the Game Boy. \n Nintendo DS - You can connect wirelessly within 30 feet. Generation V games can also connect via IR built-in to the cartridge. Use the C-Gear in the game. Click here for a guide on trading with the DS. \n Nintendo 3DS/2DS - Press the L and R buttons and select Player Search System. This will allow you to trade with the other nearby system. You can also connect to the internet and trade online. Make sure that your partner trades the evolved Golem back to you., It will evolve into Golem as soon as it is traded. Graveler's level doesn't matter. \n See if your friend has a Pokémon that evolves through trading as well. That way you can knock them both out at once. Pokémon that require trades include Clamperl, Electabuzz, Feebas, and more., Your new Golem will be on the other system. Have your friend trade it back to you to get your Golem. \n Since it's not possible to trade using an emulator, you'll need to use a workaround to evolve Graveler (and other Pokémon that rely on trading to evolve). If you're playing Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver, you can use a fan-made hack to change Graveler into a Pokémon that evolves when it reaches Level 50. This only works on the US versions of these ROM files. \n You'll need to download the custom ROM editor from this forum. Follow the link at the top of the first post to download the editor, which is a very small file. Extract the files from the ZIP once you've downloaded it. \n Run NitroExplorer2b.exe to start the editor. You may be prompted to install the .NET Framework files if they aren't already installed on your computer. \n Press the "Load ROM" button and browse for your Pokémon ROM file. \n The file you need to select varies depending on the game you are modifying: \n Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum - Open the "poketool" folder, and then open the "personal" folder. Select the "evo.narc" file. \n HeartGold, SoulSilver - Open the "a" folder, then the "0" folder, followed by the "3" folder. Select the "4" file. \n This will open the file browser. \n there should be a "4" file in the same folder as NitroExplorer2b.exe. Select this file to insert into the ROM. \n After replacing the file, you can start up your emulator and play your game. Graveler will now evolve into Golem at Level 50., You normally cannot trade between emulators, making it difficult to get Graveler to evolve. There is a special version of the VBA emulator called VBALink that allows you to run up to four instances of it at once. This lets you trade between the instances, but requires a bit of work to get going. \n You'll find this process much easier if you keep everything you need in one spot. Create a folder called "vbalink" or something similar on your Desktop. \n You can download the VBALink emulator from vbalink.info. Download the "1.72" file and extract the contents into your new folder. \n These configuration files will make the trading process much smoother. Download the ZIP containing the three INI files from this forum thread. Extract the files into the same "vbalink" folder that the emulator files are in. \n Copy the ROM file you normally use into the "vbalink" folder. \n You'll need a saved game that is far enough in the game to allow for trading. The requirements for trading vary depending on the game. \n Copy the ".sav" file and paste it twice into the "vbalink" folder. This will leave you with the original and two copies. \n Right-click the first copied saved game and select "Rename". Change the extension from ".sav" to ".sa1". Repeat the process for the second file, changing the extension to ".sa2". You should now have a ".sav", a ".sa1", and a ".sa2" file in the "vbalink" folder. \n If you don't see file extensions, click the "View" tab in Explorer and check the "File name extensions" box. \n Double-click the "VisualBoyAdvance.exe" program to start the emulator. Click "File" → "Open" and select your ROM file from the "gbalink" folder. \n Walk upstairs and stand in front of the lady who will start the trade process. Do not talk to her yet. \n The controls for the first window are WASD to move, Q for A, E for B, and Z for Select. \n Make sure that "Pause when inactive window" is not checked. \n Double-click "VisualBoyAdvance.exe" again to start another instance of VBAlink in another window. Drag this window to the right side of your screen. Click "File" → "Open" and select the same ROM file as you did before. \n The controls for this window are different. Press TFGH to move, R for A, Y for B, and V for Select. Move the character to the Pokémon Center and stand in front of the trade lady. \n The game may hang for a few seconds, just be patient and avoid hitting more keys. Choose the "Trade" option from the menu. \n This will make the character on the right screen speak to the trade lady. Select the "Trade" option. After a few moments, the trade interface should appear on both screens. \n You'll only be keeping one of the save files, so pay attention to which screen you trade it to. Graveler will evolve into Golem as soon as it is traded. \n After trading, you'll receive a notification that your game has saved. You can close your emulators at this point. \n Select the save file you want to keep. If you are keeping the save file from the left screen, select the ".sa1" file. If you are keeping the save file from the right screen, select the ".sa2" file. Copy and paste the selected file back into your original emulator's directory. \n Copy and paste the ".sav" file in your emulator directory to somewhere else in case the new file doesn't work. You can move your old save back if something goes wrong. \n Change the extension of the ".sa1" or ".sa2" file to ".sav". \n You should be able to load your game from your new save file with your newly-evolved Golem. \n If your game doesn't work, copy the "vba.ini" file from the "gbalink" folder into your regular emulator folder. \n 
 Find a font on Microsoft Word or another word processing program, print out the letters, and begin tracing them. Practice tracing these letters on a blank piece of paper.First trace the letters on a lined sheet of paper and then move to a blank sheet. \n Some pens work better than others. Try gel ink pens and calligraphy pens, however, if you cannot find those then a pencil will work just fine but will not have quite the same. \n A light box will be very useful for tracing the letters.\n Instead of printing, try writing your daily notes, homework and other handwriting in a distinctive cursive style. Emphasize the loops in letters and try not to jumble words together. Take your time and really concentrate on making your cursive look pretty. \n It might help your writing if you practice copying something that you enjoy reading. In your elegant cursive, write what you are reading into your journal or notebook. Take your time and emphasize your style. You can also use line paper if you are still trying to master your style. \n Elegant handwriting can be thicker or thinner depending on the type of writing utensil used. Markers are going to give you a larger font, while pens and pencils will be skinnier. Try out different writing tools and find one that works for you. \n Your art teacher or an employee at an art supply store should be able to recommend different writing tools for you to use. \n Buy a lined paper that has an extra-large space for writing. Think of the kind of paper that you learned to write on when you were little. Slowly write your elegant letters, being sure to fill up the entire space. With practice, you will eventually be able to do this without the lines. \n Take your time and really concentrate on filling the space. \n By practicing this visual art, you will learn how to write multiple styles of elegant handwriting. Calligraphy teaches you how to write elegantly with different tools in different medium. You will also develop the skills produce your own unique styles and fonts. If you stick with it, you will eventually be able to print, paint or chisel beautiful words on almost anything. There are workbooks and classes that you can take online to learn calligraphy. \n Your local community center or YMCA may also offer classes in calligraphy. \n The muscles in the arm, shoulder, chest and back should be conducting all of the action while you write. Your forearm, hand and fingers should be still. Writing from your shoulder results in movement that is more intricate and gives you greater stamina. It also creates smoother and cleaner looking writing. \n This movement will likely feel unnatural at first but it is crucial to developing your writing. \n Avoid writing with your fingers. The majority of people “draw” their letters by moving the pen across the paper with their hand. This method is more tiresome and gives you less control over your writing. \n Be conscious of writing with your shoulder, making it a part of your writing practice. \n Concentrate on writing using your shoulder and not your hand. Practice this until it feels natural. As you become more comfortable with the movement, make the letters smaller.You can also practice this method on a marker or chalk board. \n Start with big letters and gradually move to smaller ones. Again, remember to avoid writing with your fingers and concentrate on your shoulder. \n Start making Xs and ///s and OOOs and overlapped OOOs and spirals and | | | |s. Work on making this figures smoothly, uniformly, and evenly spaced. Practice drawing these figures daily emphasizing your strokes and movement. Repetition is important so practice these movements daily. \n Focus on making clear, well-formed letters and words. Hurriedly writing results in messy or illegible writing. Remember that you want to write elegantly and that takes time., If you begin to get sore or fatigued, your writing will suffer. Get out of your chair and walk around. Stretch the muscles in your shoulder and hand. , There is not magic bullet for developing elegant handwriting. Daily practice is the only way to hone your skill and, luckily, there are many strategies for doing this.Set aside at least 20 minutes a day to write. Begin with five minutes and work your way up. \n Follow the curriculum laid out in a handbook or online lesson. These tend to have daily exercises as part of their instruction. \n Write things out by hand more. Hand-write your notes and grocery lists. Start a journal and send written letters to friends and family. Keep a pocketbook. \n Hold it near the writing end. It is important to have the proper grip on your writing utensil. Think of your hand as the vice that holds the pen in place while you write. Try not to rest it between the thumb and index finger with the barrel on the middle finger. \n Avoid placing the pen between thumb and the index and middle fingers with the pen resting on you ring finger. \n Relax your hand while you hold the pen. Your grip needs to be firm but not so tight that your hand is tense. Having a loose grip helps relax your arm and give it greater dexterity. Imagine that the pen is made of soft rubber and that squeezing it too tightly will cause ink to blot everywhere. \n Do not curl your hand over and write to the left of your palm. That position can leading to hand cramping and discomfort.This is an important tip for lefties to remember since they are more likely to curl their hand. \n This will help you steady yourself and provide better control to your dominant hand. It will also keep the paper from moving around. Be sure you are practicing on a surface that has space to balance yourself with your other arm. \n Think about your dominant hand and position yourself in a way that gives you room to both balance and write. \n The paper position ensures the correct slant of your letters. Your letters should ideally have a 35-degree slant.If you are right-handed, the bottom-left corner of the paper should be aligned with the top-right. \n If you are left-handed, the top-left corner should be aligned with the bottom-right corner. \n Keep your spine straight and be sure to have enough space to move your shoulder freely. Try to stay loose and not be too tense while writing. Find a comfortable hard-backed chair to sit on.Avoid sitting on a couch or a recliner. \n It needs to feel comfortable to hold and move across the paper smoothly without requiring you to push it too hard on the paper. Depending on how elegant you want your handwriting to look, you may want to invest in different writing utensils.Fountain pens are believed to be the superior tool for handwriting. The expenses associated with a fountain pen are slightly higher due to the need to buy ink. \n Mechanical pens and pencils are also great choice. They allow you to try out different sized nibs and thicknesses, as well as colors. \n If you are left-handed, there are special pens designed just for you. \n For those looking for a more rustic look, a quill might be worth looking into. \n For practicing, you will want grid-lined paper because it will help you write lower and upper case letters, as well as track your progress. There are colored and raised papers for the visual perceptual challenged., If you have access to it, a drawing or drafting table is ideal for handwriting. Experts recommend writing at a 45-degree angle; however, a kitchen table or office desk will also work.Depending on the type of handwriting you are doing you might want to invest in a light box, which will help you write on paper without a grid., These workbooks have daily exercises to help you refine your writing. Depending on your skill level, there are also advanced books teach specific styles and scripts. You can take handwriting courses online and some tablets have tools that will help you practice your writing. \n 
 Immediately after the officer gives you the written citation, make sure all the information is correct, including anything identifying you or describing your car. \n Missing or incorrect information on your ticket may be grounds for dismissal.It has to be significant, however. For example, if the officer says you have a navy blue BMW when you, in fact, have a black BMW, this probably is not a big enough difference to justify dismissal of your speeding ticket. If the officer writes the ticket for a red Honda Civic when you actually have a navy blue BMW, that's a different story.\n The officer will either check off or write down the exact sections of the city or state traffic code he claims you didn't follow. \n If you don't understand what you did wrong, ask the officer on the scene before she leaves. You want to make sure you understand exactly why you were pulled over and why you're being given a ticket. \n Typically the citation itself will have contact information for either paying your fine or disputing the ticket. \n As soon as possible, make a record of the time of day when you were stopped, where you were stopped, what the weather was like, how much traffic was on the road, how long you were detained, and any other relevant information. \n Since many laws rely on subjective judgment, all of these details can help support your understanding of the situation. For example, in 20 states – including California, Texas, and Utah– speed limits are not absolute and you can make a judgment call as to whether it is safe to exceed the speed limit. Although you could still get a ticket, you could use circumstances from the time of the incident to argue you were operating your vehicle safely., If you had anyone in the car with you, or if there were people nearby who saw you get pulled over, find out if they're willing to make a statement on the record about what they saw. \n If you have eyewitnesses who are willing to testify on your behalf, make sure you have their names and contact information before you leave the scene. \n Passengers or bystanders who will testify to your version of events can help you convince the judge that you were right and the police officer's observations were inaccurate., If the officer observed you from a different location before pulling you over, go there and take pictures of what he would have seen. \n This is especially important if your case depends on an obstruction or other dangerous condition. For example, if you had to swerve to avoid a huge pothole and were pulled over and given a citation for an illegal lane change, photos of the pothole would support your argument that your actions were justified. \n You can almost always argue that the officer was not in a good position to see what happened, especially if there are obstructions or if there was heavy traffic., If the officer's position that you violated the law is based on information provided by a piece of equipment, you will need to verify that the equipment was functioning properly. \n Before you go to trial, request copies of maintenance records and schedules for any of that equipment. If the machines weren't calibrated or maintained according to industry standards, you may be able to get your ticket dismissed on the grounds that the officer's decision was based on unreliable information. \n For example, most radar guns need to be re-calibrated either once a month or once every other month. If the gun was not calibrated, or if the officer did not check the calibration when he issued the ticket, you may be able to get your ticket dismissed., Make sure you have the officer's name, his badge number, and his patrol car number. \n If the officer who issued your citation filed a report or made any notes about the traffic stop, you are entitled to copies of those as well. \n Given the time and effort it would take to fight a traffic ticket, if the infraction is minor and the fine is small, you might be better off simply paying the fine and moving on with your life. \n Although ignorance of the law is never an excuse, a legitimate and understandable mistake of a key fact may get you off the hook.For example, if you didn't stop at a crosswalk because the paint was so faded it was barely visible, the judge might cut you some slack. However, arguing that you didn't stop because you didn't know you were supposed to stop at a crosswalk won't help you. \n Even though you technically violated a traffic ordinance, in some circumstances you must make an illegal maneuver to avoid something far more dangerous.For example, if you were swerving to avoid hitting an animal crossing the road, you might be able to get a ticket for an illegal lane change dismissed. \n However, keep in mind that you have to be able to prove that your version of events happened. If there was nobody else in your car who saw the animal and it's going to come down to your word against the word of the police officer, you're probably better off to simply pay the fine. \n Your own inattention or personal need aren't the same thing as avoiding harm. The harm you avoid must be something you didn't cause.For example, if you were having a fight with your sister on your cell phone and ran a red light, that argument would not excuse your actions in the event a police officer pulled you over and wrote you a ticket. \n Find a copy of the code and break the section down into elements. If one of the elements is missing in your case, you can't be held liable. \n Look at the portions of the code where personal judgment come into play. Many traffic laws are not absolute and rely on the driver to make an honest assessment of what conduct is best given weather and highway conditions. For example, speed limits aren't absolute in more than a dozen states – this means that even if you get a ticket for exceeding the speed limit in those states, you can still make an argument that the speed at which you were traveling was safe given the totality of the circumstances.Nearly any violation that has the word "unsafe" in it implies a subjective judgment was made on the part of the police officer. Any time you are cited for an unsafe movement, the door is open for you to argue that from your position, your actions were in fact safe.If highway signs or signals figured into your citation, check them against the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, published by the Federal Highway Administration. The MUTCD is a compilation of national standards for all traffic control devices.If you can demonstrate that the relevant sign or signal didn't meet applicable standards, your ticket may be dismissed on those grounds. \n Although you don't have the right to an appointed attorney, you may be able to hire a traffic attorney who can help you fight the ticket. \n In many jurisdictions, you can attend traffic school and have a minor violation dismissed. Typically this option is only available for first-time offenders or for relatively minor infractions. \n If it's your first ticket in the jurisdiction, you may be able to take a special "no contest" plea in which you pay a reduced fee and the violation doesn't add points to your license or go on your insurance., In many states you can have a trial by mail. You write a letter explaining why you shouldn't be held liable for the violation, and then the officer writes in with his side of the story. If the officer fails to write in, you win by default. However, if you lose by mail you can still request an in-person hearing., You may have automatically been assigned a hearing date, or your city may require you to request a hearing date. If you're responsible for requesting a hearing, do so as soon as possible after you get your ticket so you have a greater choice on dates and times. \n In most jurisdictions, the police officer who issued your citation is required to show up at your hearing. If he does not appear, your ticket may be dismissed automatically. \n If your ticket already has a date on it, consider having it changed. Typically the officer who issued your ticket already has that date in his schedule and plans to attend several hearings that day. If you have the date of your hearing changed, there's a greater possibility the officer won't show up. \n Requesting a continuance also may increase the chances that the officer isn't available to show up., Dress in clean, professional clothing and arrive early for your hearing. Bring copies of all documents along with any evidence or witnesses you wish to present. \n Treat all court staff with respect. If there are other cases being heard before yours, take a seat and wait your turn. When you are called to come forward, address the judge as "your honor" and don't speak unless you are asked a question. \n Leave your mobile phone or any other electronic devices at home or in the car – don't try to bring them with you into the courtroom. \n Organize your documents and evidence before you get there so you aren't shuffling through papers if the judge asks for something. \n When the judge calls on you, explain briefly why you are not liable for the traffic violation. Keep your argument succinct and stick to the facts. \n If you've brought witnesses to testify on your behalf, keep your questions brief and make sure they stay in line with what you're trying to prove rather than digressing., You can make notes if there's something you want to ask her about. But don't interrupt her or argue with her. \n Don't insult the police officer or accuse her of lying. If it comes down to an argument between you and the police officer without any factual evidence, the judge probably will believe the police officer. \n After the officer has finished her testimony, the judge will give you an opportunity to ask her questions. \n You want to establish some doubt in the officer's mind, as well as in the judge's mind. The officer may have walked into that courtroom absolutely convinced that she was correct in giving you a ticket, but if you can place doubt in her mind she may become less sure of herself. If the officer isn't entirely sure, the judge won't be sure either, and might dismiss your ticket. \n Create uncertainty in the officer's mind by challenging her subjective conclusions. Police officers often don't know the exact wording or interpretation of a law. The officer who pulled you over may not have realized that she has to make a judgment call every time she writes a ticket for violating a law that requires safe or responsible vehicle operation.Ask the officer how she came to the conclusion that your driving was unsafe or irresponsible, and then provide her with evidence she didn't have at the time. \n For example, suppose she gave you a ticket for an unsafe lane change. She only saw you swerve erratically into the left lane and then back into the right; however, she didn't see the deer crossing the road that you swerved to avoid. This information might change her judgment, since it would be safer for you to swerve than to hit the deer. \n You also can impeach the officer's testimony by challenging her observations.This is why you talked to witnesses and took photos of the scene. \n For example, suppose you ask the officer to describe the weather conditions when she pulled you over, and she says it was bright and sunny. If you have a photo showing that the conditions actually were gray and cloudy, use it to cast doubt on her observations. When she later says she's certain your car was the one that was speeding, you get the opportunity to ask her how certain she is – as certain as she was that it was bright and sunny? \n After both sides have presented all evidence, the judge will decide if you are liable for the violation or not. \n If the judge rules against you and you decide you want to appeal, ask the court clerk for information on the appeals process.
 Flick up a switch to the back of the presser foot or on the side of the machine. There is a presser bar lever located in one of these positions.\n Raise the needle to its highest position., These are usually two plastic pins located on the top or near the base that hold your spools of thread. Locate the stool pins and remove them. \n Insert the spool pin on top of the spool. It is required to keep the spool pins in place. \n You only need two spools of thread if you are using two needles. \n Draw out a foot of extra thread with which you will thread the upper portion of the machine. Cut the end of the thread so that it is easier to thread through the needle. \n Bring the thread through the first hole and pull it through the partial hole on the other side. It should be threaded from the bottom through the top of the partial hole and then stretched downward. \n If you are threading two spools of thread, the first one should pass through the right side of the upper thread tension disk and the back spool should thread through the left side of the upper thread tension disk. They will attach to two different needles. \n It should catch on the thread guide lightly as you pull it through and continue downward. \n Then, pass the end of the thread through the eye of the needle. Pull at least four inches (10cm) of thread through the needles. \n Note that the thread from a second spool should go from the back spool, to the left side of the tension disk and through the eye of the left needle. \n This is the metal compartment in which the bobbin or backing thread is stored. \n Many Necchi machines have bobbin cases and you must pull up on the latch to release the bobbin and pull it out. \n This thread color should be chosen to go on the underside of your project. Pull out two inches (five cm) of excess thread from the bobbin. \n The bobbin must turn clockwise, so ensure it is going this direction when you insert it. \n It will go underneath the tension spring. Pull the thread another two inches forward. \n Hold it open. Place the bobbin case onto the center pin in the shuttle race. \n Check to see if the bobbin case is secured. Close the shuttle race cover. \n Turn your hand wheel toward you until the needle goes down through the floor of the machine and up again. \n Pull this thread out further. \n Now, you can use your sewing machine.
 Anywhere between 6 and 8 weeks is the shortest duration you should attempt for a weight loss challenge. Shorter challenges will have the least drastic results in the end, but they can also be the most productive because there’s a slight sense of urgency throughout the competition.Between 8 and 10 weeks is the most commonly used time frame for a weight loss challenge. Give the challenge a catchy name that references the duration of the event, like the “10-Week Lifestyle Reboot” or something else similarly motivating.12 weeks should be the maximum duration for a weight loss challenge. After 12 weeks people may start to lose interest in the competition or drop out because it’s too strenuous.\n The recommended and safest rate of weight loss is approximately 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) per week.On average, you need to burn 500 to 1,000 calories more than you consume each day, by way of diet and exercise, to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week. This is a realistic goal that everyone can shoot for. \n As host of the competition, it will be your responsibility to convey to the participants that ultimately the contest is about health, not weight. \n Caution your participants about using extreme measures and unhealthy methods to lose weight, and warn them about the dangers of losing too much weight too quickly. When you host the first meeting, provide literature about healthy weight loss strategies, along with quality information about diet and exercise for safe weight loss. \n Emphasize that they should use diet and exercise to lose weight, not starve themselves. State clearly and kindly that you'll have to privately intervene if you notice anyone who starts shedding weight inexplicably fast or starts to look unhealthy during the contest and that it could result in their disqualification. \n Most challenges measure success by pounds lost, and this method will be easiest for you to measure. Providing the data in pounds lost will also more straightforward for the participants. Ultimately, the winner will be determined by calculating the highest percentage of weight loss over the time period of the challenge. \n Record each participant’s weight every week, and on the final day of the competition you will get the average of those weekly weigh-ins and subtract that number from the participant’s start weight. \n The objective is to reveal who showed the most improvement over the course of the contest, measured by percentage of weight loss.Sometimes weight loss challenges will measure success by body fat percentage instead of pounds lost. Both methods of measurement are effective, but it may be easier to measure body fat percentages accurately if you have a personal trainer or fitness expert involved in the competition. \n Working in teams can be a lot more fun (and effective) for everyone involved. If you decide to do teams, the process will be slightly different. Create small groups of 2 to 6 people, with one of them acting as team captain. Success will be measured by total percentage lost by the group rather than individually. \n The weigh-ins will work the same as with individual play, except that the team captain will record everyone's weights and submit them each week. \n The captain will also be responsible for making sure everyone in the group makes the weigh-ins and for team support in general. \n Make it something affordable, like $25 or $50 per person. The collected amount can fund the cash prize for the winner and also cover any expenses associated with the competition, such as T-shirts or planning a post-challenge party to celebrate everyone’s success. \n If you decide to require an entry fee, task one person with being in charge of the funds throughout the challenge. Keep the money in a secure place, like in a lock box or safe, and make sure that all expenses are well-documented. \n Skip the entree fee requirement if you think it will discourage others from participating in the challenge. \n If you aren’t sure, send out an email to announce the competition. Get a feel for who is interested in competing and then poll those people about what amount would be fair and affordable to charge as an entry fee. \n Usually the reward is the cash prize generated from the collected entry fees (minus any expenses). You could also offer prizes like laptops, iPads, or gift certificates, if you have that capability. \n If you are holding the challenge for colleagues at your place of employment, ask your employer to sponsor the event and provide prizes for the competition. \n You’ll need to decide if the winner takes all, or if you plan to have first and second place winners in the competition. A winner-takes-all prize is certainly more of an incentive for the participants, but if you have several generous prizes planned, it would make sense to have first and second place winners. \n Supply someone in management with all of the challenge information and guidelines. Additionally, you should speak with someone in the Human Resources department about the contest. When announced, it should be stressed that participation is completely optional. \n Enlist the HR department's help in announcing the contest, as well as monitoring employees for any unsafe or negative behavior. Consider having the HR department speak to everyone as a group about safety. Since crash diets can affect work performance, HR will need to help monitor the staff for any behavioral or performance changes. \n If anyone on staff is uncomfortable with the contest because of past (or current) eating disorders, or for any other reason, let the group know when the contest is announced that the employee should speak to the HR department privately about it. If there are any major protests or problems reported, have HR help you shut down the competition. \n Wait for the official go-ahead from management and Human Resources before announcing anything about the competition to your colleagues. \n Since the challenge will encourage employees to be healthier, find out if your employer would be willing to help cover expenses and provide the cash prize. \n Whether you're setting up the competition for your friends, family, or colleagues, a successful challenge requires active and engaged participants. Establish who you want to recruit and announce the competition via email. \n Create fliers, emails, a Facebook group and, if possible, provide a website where people can get more information and sign up to participate. \n Consider calling it a Wellness Competition rather than a Weight Loss Competition, to put the emphasis on health rather than weight loss. Promote the competition with vocabulary and imagery that is health-oriented and not completely weight-focused. \n Along with announcing the competition prizes, try upping the stakes. Have each participating person or team choose their favorite charity or community outreach program and offer to award a portion (or even all) of the prize money to the chosen beneficiary. \n If you are organizing the challenge among coworkers, ask if your company will match the donation. \n Recruit local health and wellness professionals to provide informal seminars throughout the challenge on subjects related to fitness, well-being and weight loss. \n Invite a local chef to demonstrate healthy cooking and provide recipes. \n Visit personal trainers and gyms in your area to see if they would like to offer their services or become involved in the challenge in some way. \n Create well-defined policies for all components of the challenge and provide this information to the participants in document form. Additionally, post the contest rules on the challenge website and make them available through social media. Detail the prizes and any other important information that relates specifically to the contest. \n Make sure to include all important dates, the rules for entry, and the procedure for how measurements will be taken. \n Don’t forget to include any prohibited activities that could result in disqualification, such as taking weight loss supplements or engaging in unsafe weight-loss strategies. \n If you are organizing the competition at work, ask management to sign off on the policies and procedures. Make sure that the Human Resources department reviews all of the information, and enlist their help for monitoring the staff for any red flags. \n Arrange a space for this purpose and have the entire process organized prior to announcing the contest. Taking measurements can be done as simply as using a bathroom scale to record the participants’ weight, or you could plan to have a personal trainer or health professional weigh-in participants and take body fat measurements. \n The most accurate way to track weight loss is by setting a routine day and time (preferably in the morning before breakfast) each week to record the measurements.Network with local community experts, such as personal trainers and nutritionists, and offer them the opportunity to make new contacts or give talks in exchange for taking measurements. \n Set this date in stone and establish a deadline for entries, so that the challenge follows a strict and manageable timeline. Announce the meeting time and place for the initial weigh-in and answer any questions about the process. \n Reassure the participants that all weight information will be kept confidential. \n Consulting a physician before embarking on a new health routine is a good habit for everyone to get into and setting that standard lends a professional quality to your challenge. \n It also emphasizes that good health is more important than any weight that might be lost in a competition. \n If you want total peace of mind about the health of your participants, you could even make this a requirement upon entry. \n Have the participants come in to be weighed and record everyone’s starting weight using whatever method you established at the introductory meeting. Use a systematized method, such as a spreadsheet, to record the name and starting weight of each participant. \n Make sure that everyone knows the dates and times for the weekly weigh-ins for the remaining duration of the challenge. \n If desired, you could photograph each participant at the initial weigh-in and plan to do the same at the final weigh-in. You could then provide your participants with a before and after snapshot to document their success. \n Each week, after everyone has weighed in, send out an encouraging email to all the participants. You can keep the participants updated on who’s in the lead throughout the competition, or simply offer motivation and encouraging words to keep everyone engaged in the challenge. \n Additionally, try sending out group emails throughout the duration of the challenge that provide a steady stream of healthy weight-loss tips, recipes, resources and encouragement to your group. \n Create opportunities for the participants to get together periodically during the challenge. This gives everyone a chance to meet face-to-face to support one another and share their weight-loss experiences while also fostering a sense of community among the competitors. \n You can also use these mini-events as opportunities to gauge and maintain everyone’s interest and enthusiasm in the challenge. \n Mid-challenge events could be almost anything that you think would pique the interest of your participants. Offering a complimentary yoga class, hosting a fun run, and inviting everyone to a healthy pot-luck picnic at your local park are all great examples of motivational events. \n Encourage them to share their personal diet and exercise tips there, as well as their experiences and progress photos. Promote a sense of community rather than focusing solely on the competitive element of the challenge. \n If possible, provide a way for the participants to receive feedback and support and frequently share resources like weight loss websites and health forums with the group. \n On the day the competition ends, have everyone come in for their final weigh-in. Hold the meeting first thing in the morning, prior to breakfast, since that’s the best time to gauge everyone’s most accurate weight.Meticulously record everyone’s final weight and plug the numbers into your spreadsheet. \n Offer a simple, healthy assortment of breakfast foods for your participants to enjoy after their final weigh-in. \n Let everyone know how and when you will be revealing the results of the challenge. You could host an announcement party at lunchtime that day or soon after, so that the participants don’t have to wait too long to hear the news. \n For each participant, calculate the average of their weekly weigh-ins. Subtract that number from each participant’s starting weight, and this will give you a very precise measure of how much progress each person made. \n Gather everyone together and reveal the winner. Provide each participant with individual progress reports that show the data you collected during the competition to highlight their individual successes. \n Calculate the total overall weight lost by the group and announce that number, as well, congratulating the group on their collective success. \n Thank everyone for their participation and encourage them to continue the healthy habits they’ve established during the challenge. \n Send out a group email that details all of this information, so that anyone who couldn’t attend the announcement will know who won. You could send out the progress reports individually via email, as well. \n After the winner is announced, make sure everyone sticks around for a mini-celebration. Cater the event with healthy food options and provide weight-loss literature and resources that the participants can take away with them. \n Keep the atmosphere positive and emphasize that everyone was successful, even if only one winner was chosen. \n 
  One that will accept a stereo mini plug.  Remove cover of the unit to expose the internal speaker.  Drill hole in side of the cover of the unit, in close proximity to the internal speaker.  Hole should be just big enough to allow the threaded end of the Headphone jack to slide in.  Secure it with the washer nut. \n  Using an electronic soldering iron, solder the ends of the speaker wires to the internal speaker and then to the headphone jack.  Do not remove the existing wires to the internal speaker from their contacts.  Replace the cover of the unit and secure all screws.  The headphone jack will now accept mini plugs from either an FM transmitter, or an external speaker.  If you want to allow both to work at the same time, you need to put in another headphone jack, and repeat the process.,  The one that has the 6" patch cord and mini plug attached.  This comes with 20 pre set channel selections.  Use your vehicle as a test by turning your radio on and tuning to the channel you have set on the transmitter.  Experiment with all the channels on the transmitter to see which one gives you the best sound quality.  I chose 90.1 and can pick up the sound from my unit up to about 200' in any direction of the house.  This transmitter is run with 2 triple A batteries.  You will need to turn it off and unplug it every night and bring it in the house or the batteries won't last long.  If you live in warmer climates, just turn it off each night.,  If it does not you will need to solder one to the end of the wires.  Get one at Radio Shack for next to nothing.  Use a stereo plug even though the jack is wired from one speaker, it carries the full range of stereo sound.  Radio Shack also carries extension patch cords to allow the external speaker to be at some distance from the unit.  I have my unit in an enclosed area, out of the weather, and, I also built a wooden housing for the entire unit to keep it dry and snow free.  You can add as many patch cords as you need to acquire the length you need.  Use cords that have the stereo plugs at the ends and use stereo connectors to plug them together.  No sound quality will be lost whatever the length you chose.  I have 40' of patch cords plugged together and the sound is perfect.  The patch cords are not cheap however, and this was the most expensive part of the project.  All in all about $30 for the entire project, including the transmitter.,  This may require an extension cord as well for the speaker, for the amplified sound.  You can use a speaker without amplified sound if you prefer, but it will require a higher volume from your sounds machine.,  As it turned out it was one of the easiest projects I've done, and not at all as complicated as some would make you believe.  All it requires is a phillips screwdriver and a soldering iron for tools.  The supplies may put a dent in your debit card account, but it wasn't nearly as expensive as I thought, and the results are well worth the $30 it cost.,  Now all passersby, either on foot or in their vehicles can enjoy the music.  Fantastic addition to a really nice unit.,  Purchase a remote timer.  Stein's garden center or Walgreen's has them.  The remote will allow you to turn them on from the warmth of the inside of your house and turn them off when you want.  It also allows you to leave the power switch on the machine on.  It does not draw current to the machine when the timer is off, only to the remote timer itself.  My machine is outside, though somewhat protected, in the cold winter of Wisconsin, and have not had a problem at all.  However, I have found that these machines are power sensitive.  Dedicate one outlet for this machine and nothing else.  If you have more than one outside socket available, at different areas of the house, use one that has nothing else plugged into it.  I had to run an 80' extension cord, with this machine plugged into it, to the back of the house, to an empty socket, otherwise the songs would skip badly.  Now it works perfectly, every day, regardless of weather. ,  I hope all of you have the same great results that I've gotten.  Good luck, enjoy your efforts.  You will be pleased with the end result.

 Do you want him or her to change for you? And if so, consider that it would be fair for your partner to want you to change for them as well. Another thing you can try is to fully accept whatever it is you want them to change. Say it aloud: "I accept that he/she is a total slob." Then ask yourself: Do the benefits of the relationship outweigh that fact? If so, try accepting and dealing with your partner as they are, rather than trying to change them. \n If this is something so big or bothersome that you simply can't get over it and the person won't change, then it may be time to end the relationship. \n Maybe you and your partner come from different religious backgrounds. If your partner refuses to convert and so do you and religion is very important to you, then this may indeed be a deal breaker for you.\n You may discover that you want to break up because you don't want to face certain issues in yourself, like insecurity or fear of abandonment, but they are sure to turn up in any relationship you're in. For example, maybe you've been cheated on before, and you're tempted to break up with this person before you get too attached and become vulnerable to being deeply hurt again. That's not a good reason to break up. You need to address your fears, rather than run away from them. \n If you think your issues are the problem, then talk to your partner about them and see if you can find a way to work through them together. \n If you're the kind of person who's used to looking out for everyone else's needs, maybe deep down you know you don't want to be in this relationship, but you're scared of telling the person it's over. You have to realize, however, that you're not doing this person any favors by staying with them out of sympathy. Reading How to Stop Being a People Pleaser might help. \n If you know that the relationship has no real future for you, then ending it as quickly as possible will be the best thing you can do for your partner, because you'll be giving him or her the chance to heal and find a more fitting relationship in the future. \n Though it's ideal to end the relationship during a calm time, don't keep holding off because of a birthday, a wedding, Valentine's Day, Christmas with your family, or a million other reasons that would make it "inconvenient" to be broken up. This can go on forever and there is no perfect time to end a relationship (though some are, of course, better than others). \n Are you scared of being single? Another reason sometimes people are reluctant to end a relationship is because they don't want to be alone. But staying with someone as a "placeholder" is not only unfair to them, but also unfair to yourself, because then you're less likely to develop as an individual and find the right person for you. Read How to Enjoy Being Single and How to Be Optimistic for encouragement. \n Or, maybe they're just not all that into you. No one knows exactly why we like or love the people we do. Sometimes we just don't connect. Or sometimes one person develops strong feelings, and the other doesn't. It happens. And it hurts, but it's not anyone's fault. Affection and love can't be forced. You might have been madly in love at some point, but how long ago was that? The sooner you admit how you really feel, the sooner you can do something about it. \n Spend some time sitting alone with your eyes closed, focusing on your breath. Though this may not lead to an epiphany about what you should do about your relationship, it can help you feel centered and more in touch with your thoughts. You may be too busy panicking that you haven't had a moment to sit down and really listen to what your mind and body are telling you. \n This is an important point. If your work or group of friends are having a happy hour, are you excited to bring along your significant other because you know how awesome he or she is, or do you make excuses for not bringing that person around because you hate bringing him or her out in social situations? \n Sure, some people are more shy than others and some situations can be more fun without your significant other, but generally, you should be proud of the person you're with and feel excited to show him off. If you're not happy about other people seeing you with that person, then how can you be happy in the relationship? \n This kind of relationship is unhealthy. In order for the relationship to survive, the manipulative partner would need to dramatically change his or her behavior. If he or she won't, or can't, it would be wise to end it as soon as possible. If you feel like your partner is running everything you do and threatening you if you want to act independently, then you have a major problem. \n If you are being manipulated or controlled, then this is one of the rare cases where you may not want to break up with the person face-to-face; if you're afraid of a violent reaction if you end the relationship, do it from a distance and have a friend help you pick up the pieces. \n If your significant other really cares about you, then he or she isn't going to demean you or be critical of you for no reason. If the person gives you constructive feedback to help you grow as a person that's one thing, but if the person is intentionally malicious, that's another. For example, if you drop and break something and your partner says something like, "You are an idiot, why don't you look at what you are doing for once in your life?" then that right there should be more than a sign that you need to leave that person and move on to somebody that will take better care of you. \n Your partner's lack of respect may be more subtle. Maybe the person pokes fun at certain aspects of your looks, makes jabs about your career, or hints that you're not very good at something. That's still disrespect -- big time. \n It's okay to fight now and again, and fighting can even be healthy for a relationship once in a while if it helps you discuss your frustrations in a constructive manner. However, if your partner is always yelling at you, disagreeing with you, calling you names, and generally being cruel to you for no reason, then it's time to get out. \n This is a huge red flag. If your partner is embarrassed to bring you around or even to say that you two are dating, then you have a major problem. There are few good reasons for the person to hide your love, unless the person is too young to date or has a good reason to hide the relationship from overbearing parents. But if the person wants to keep it a secret from your friends or acquaintances or refuses to hold your hand or look like you're dating in public, then it may be time to end the relationship. You want to be with someone who is proud, not ashamed, to be with you, because that's what you deserve. \n If you are having a cuddling session, but you are the one that needs to start it off or try to spice things up almost every time, then you may be in trouble. Especially if you are going for the hello or goodbye kiss and you ask the person to kiss you, then there may be some real issues in the relationship. Don't be afraid to talk about it; maybe your partner has intimacy issues or doesn't want to touch you because you cheated. Whatever the problem is, you need to work on it or end things, because the status quo is not working. \n If they make you drink when you don't want to, have sex when you aren't ready, or even engage in reckless behavior like speeding, harassing strangers, or generally conducting yourself in a way that makes you scared, then it's time to end the relationship. The person does not value your wants and needs and you can find someone who actually cares for you. \n It may take you a minute to realize that you have been doing something that you were not comfortable with, because you were just trying to get in the swing of things. \n Though you shouldn't end your relationship just because your best friend vaguely thinks you can "do better," you should reconsider your relationship if all of your friends, family members, or even people you barely know go out of their way to tell you to get out of the relationship as soon as you can. If they have concrete reasons, like that the person really doesn't like you or treats you like a rag doll, then that's even more indicative of the fact that it's time to break up. \n Of course, people may not understand how your relationship works and you can't go around basing the quality of your relationship on whether other people like the two of you together. But if everyone is telling you to get out, you should at least consider that they have a good reason for doing so. \n Your relationship should grow at its own pace and you should take the time to get to know each other. If you just met your partner two months ago and you're already talking about moving in together or getting married, then you may both be obsessed with the idea of commitment, but not each other. If you feel like you're in over your head with the relationship without ever even taking the time to get to know the person you're in the relationship with, then you need to slow down or stop. \n Okay, so if you're fifteen, it's okay to never bring up marriage, moving, where you see your careers, if you want to have kids, etc, but if you're twenty-five or thirty-five or have been dating for several years, then the subject of the future should come up eventually and naturally. If you have been together for a long time and neither of you mentions anything more than a month in the future, then chances are it's because you don't see each other being a couple in the long-term. If this is the case, then you have to think about whether the relationship is worth pursuing at all. \n Though a series of less-serious signs can also indicate the need for a break-up, there are some signs that almost always indicate that you either need to end your relationship or seriously change your tune. If these signs apply to you, then it may be time to break-up: \n You've suffered physical and/or psychological abuse, financial exploitation, sexual abuse or degradation from your partner past the point of damage to your health and safety. \n Your partner constantly pressures you to do something you're not comfortable with, such as being part of a dangerous or criminal activity. Harsh ultimatums and threatening statements that create pressure to are all signs of a potentially dangerous relationship. Don't fall for the "If you really love me, you'd do this..." trick. \n Endless strife or despair has taken over the major areas of couple functioning – communication, sex, finances and emotional support. \n Jealousy becomes a major issue. A relationship becomes unhealthy if your partner tries to put restrictions on who you hang out with, when, and for how long. Your partner is not in control of your social life; you are. \n Your partner has been involved in long-term alcohol or drug abuse/addiction that they can't break free from and your life, or your childrens' lives, have suffered markedly because of it. \n You are involved in long-term alcohol or drug addiction that you can't break free from. You aren't doing anyone any good by staying in the relationship. \n Your relationship was based on superficial foundations that no longer work, such as partying, shared hobbies, or sex without love, and you are ready to move beyond these things. \n Your partner tries to control what you wear and how you look. It is your body, your face, your hair, and your wardrobe; you decide what to do with it. \n A true loving partner should be loving all the time no matter what the situation is so, if your relationship is on and off, then it's time to leave because there is something wrong. Do not go back and fix the relationship because you are better without the headache as well as the heartache, and there are others that are waiting for you go find them. \n If you see yourself as a marine biologist who will travel the world and your partner wants to be a teacher and to live in Texas near her family all of her life, then you have a problem. If you don't want to have kids and she wants to have seven and to get started yesterday, then you have a problem. If your dreams and visions of the future really don't line up -- and you have to figure out your next steps soon -- then it's time to get out. \n If you're still a teenager, then yeah, your life goals may change and you have time to think it over. But if you need to start planning for your futures now and there's no possible intersection, then it may be time to rethink the relationship. \n Cheating is never a good sign, whether you have a history of cheating or are cheating because you're unhappy in the relationship. Though you can learn to forgive each other, if it's a repeated thing, then chances are that too much damage has been done for your relationship to recover. This may be your way of sending each other a message that your relationship just isn't enough. \n This is a hard one. You may have really loved each other when you were in high school or college, but now you find that you're just completely different people with different friends, dreams, and interests. If you find that the only thing you have in common is your shared history, and that it isn't enough, then it may be time to move on. This is one of the hardest reasons for a break-up, because it isn't anyone's fault, and you both must still have a lot of affection for each other, but that doesn't mean you should stay together if it's not right for the people you are today. \n Any form of secrets or deception, even if you haven't gone as far as cheating, is a red flag that says that there's no trust or honor in the relationship. You shouldn't hide anything bigger than a surprise party from your significant other. This is different from not sharing your latest complaints about work with your significant other because you know it'll bore her; it's more like hiding the fact that you're interviewing for a job in a different state because you don't know what you'll do if you get it. \n If you used to go on romantic picnics, hikes, plan elaborate dates, and take care of each other when you were feeling sick, but now you can barely make the effort to pick up your phone and answer your significant other's text message, then you need to put in more effort or end the relationship. If you or your partner just aren't trying any more, then you must feel that the relationship is not worth it, deep down. \n Maybe you and your significant other have already unofficially broken up without doing the dirty work. If you spend most of your weekends with separate friends, visiting your families alone, or just staying in and pursuing your own hobbies instead of hanging out together -- think of watching two different televisions in two different rooms -- then you may be already drifting apart without having the big talk. If this is the case, then it may be time for a break up. \n If the relationship is not worth saving, you will be able to see that when both of you are calm. Additionally, breaking up out of anger can make it very difficult to find closure. Make sure you're feeling rational and have taken some time to really think about it before you have "the talk." \n Agree to not see each other for a week or two, and be sure to clarify that you are still together and your relationship will remain exclusive during this time. Don't spend time together, don't talk on the phone, don't send each other messages. This trial separation might help you see how much you value the relationship...or don't. If it's difficult at first, but if you find yourself at peace without this person in your life, breaking up is probably a good idea. \n If you enjoy the first few days but then find yourself missing this person and feeling like your life is incomplete without them, you should probably try to repair the relationship. See more details in How to Give Each Other Space. \n If you've taken the time to think about whether or not you should end the relationship, then you can see if the signs of a good relationship apply to you, too. Here are some signs that you should fight to stay with the person you're with, even if it means that you have to take some drastic changes: \n There is a core foundation of similar values and beliefs that you share, especially spiritual and moral values. \n You still trust each other; you know your partner is on your side and have faith they will work with you for the greater good of your household. \n Hard times have taken over suddenly without giving you time to find your center. Health problems, trauma, financial problems, addiction regressions and depression can come on in an instant and make things look really dark. Give it time, let the smoke clear, and try to be a friend to each other until it's over. \n You are caught in a negative response cycle where negative behavior triggers more negative behavior. Break the cycle by gaining control of your own negative reactions, call for a peace treaty, and give your partner time to get a handle on their negativity. \n You have a tendency to run from commitment at the first sign of trouble. Take some time to cool down and work to become friends again. Commit to friendship, remember what you used to like about your partner, and act like you care. It's good for you to see if you can stick through the problems for once, no matter how it ends up. \n You have drifted apart slowly and suddenly discover you are living with a stranger. This generally happens due to neglect, so work on it - talk, listen, spend time together and see if you can rediscover love. \n 
 The more information you are able to provide about your financial status, the easier it will be to maneuver through the mortgage application process. Collect a list of information about your debts and assets and print out a summary that you can show to lenders. \n Get an updated credit report. Take care of details that are not correct and pay outstanding debts as much as you can. This will increase your credit score and allow you to get better interest rates.Make a list of your debts. Include balances owed and account numbers. You'll need this information when you fill out a loan application. \n Put together a list of all your assets. This should include both checking and savings accounts, investment accounts, retirement accounts and any personal property you own (like cars or boats).\n There are some basic loan terms that are simple to understand but may be confusing at first to borrowers who are unfamiliar with them. Learn a few of the basic terms so that you understand what your lender is talking about and know what to look for. Your lender should also be able to explain these terms and any other, more complex terms that may show up. For now, start with the following terms: \n Annual percentage rate (APR). This is the annual interest rate charged on the loan. \n Lender fees. These are additional fees (on top of interest) that are paid to the lender at closing. \n Loan program. This is the general type of mortgage that describes the interest rates and length of the loan's life. Some common loan programs include 15-year fixed mortgage rate or 30-year adjustment rate mortgage (ARM). \n "Good Faith" estimate. This is the initial, pre-approval set of loan terms given to you by a lender. It includes the interest rate and any additional fees that will be charged., It will be difficult to find the right lender if you don't know what kind of mortgage you are looking for. For example, think about how quickly you want to pay off your mortgage. The lives of these loans can vary widely in length, so make sure you know what your plan is. Just make sure to consider that paying off the loan in a shorter time will result in higher monthly payments (but less overall interest paid)., Think about specifically what you want to know when applying for a mortgage loan. For example, consider asking what monthly payments would be under a variety of different loan terms. Or, you could ask why certain fees are charged. You can ask any number of things of your lender without even applying for loan, so ask as many questions as you need to. If your lender doesn't take the time to respond to them or is difficult to reach, you may want to seek other lenders.Keep the questions consistent between lenders so you have a standard of comparison. \n Ask about special mortgage loans if you think you qualify for them.Special loan programs include VA loans (for veterans of the armed forces), USDA loans (for rural areas), and programs offered by state or local governments. These programs may offer borrowers lower rate or better repayment terms., The first lender you find may not have the best loan package. You should take advantage of any connections you have that can refer you to a reputable mortgage lender. \n Call your current mortgage lender or bank, if you've had a good experience with them in the past. Being a return customer may give you some leverage with negotiations. \n Search the Internet financial sections for mortgage interest rates. \n Talk to friends for recommendations. \n Take recommendations from real estate professionals for mortgage lenders they've had a good working relationship with., Don't be afraid to ask questions if you don't understand the type of loans they're proposing. \n For example, you should always ask for the specific interest rate charged on each loan duration. This is also known as the annual percentage rate (APR). \n Additionally, you should ask whether the stated interest rate on each loan is fixed (non-changing) or adjustable (changing)., Get interest rates for various different types of loans and loan durations from each lender so that you can compare these different loan types between them. This also will be helpful if you change your mind about the loan duration you want. \n For example, imagine you are considering either a 15 year or a 30 year loan. You ask for rate estimates from two lenders. The first offers you a 15 year loan at 3.1 percent and a 30 year estimate of 3.8 percent. The second offers rates of 3.2 and 3.7 percent, respectively. You would then see that the first lender offered a better rate for the 15 year loan but was not as good of a choice for the 30 year loan., This statement is a "Good Faith Estimate." Most reputable mortgage lenders will offer to provide this for you. \n Make sure the Good Faith Estimate includes costs for all points, processing, legal fees, filing and closing fees. \n You can also have the lender email or fax this estimate to you as a backup., Access the National Mortgage Licensing System & Registry (NMLS) to determine whether or not each of your mortgage lenders are licensed in your state. Immediately eliminate from the list those lenders that do not show up on this website. The NMLS can be accessed at http://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org., How a lender acted when you met with them can say a lot about how doing business with them will be later. Look for lenders who were helpful, professional, and willing to answer any questions you had. Did the lender stick to the interest rate they quoted over the phone or online? Do they set forth a timeline for progressing with your loan application (when to lock in rates, etc.)? Eliminate any lenders that seemed shady in any way.Also, pass on the mortgage lenders that did not provide clear written information. \n Search for each lender online to locate reviews of that lender. There should be sources like Zillow.com and Google local reviews that show up when you search for the lender. Look for higher scores and watch out for any problems other borrowers have run into with that lender., Lenders may be able to waive or lower some of the fees, even those that they originally try to argue are "necessary." For example, you should try to negotiate down the application fee to free or near free, if possible. Additionally, the appraisal fee is a necessary fee, but only if it is within reasonable bounds; you should negotiate down an appraisal fee that is over $400. If you are using a broker to get your loan, you may also be able to negotiate down origination fees and underwriting fees. \n Some fees are always non-negotiable. These include recording fees, title insurance, tax-related fees, document stamp fees, and title fees.You may also be able to negotiate discount points down. However, these are essentially a form of prepaid interest on the house, so you gain nothing in the long run by avoiding this expense now. \n For example, you might be able to pay $2,000 to reduce your interest rate by 0.25 percent. This would save you money by reducing your monthly payment by a small amount each month, and would add up over the life of your loan., The lowest rate is not necessarily the best option if there are thousands of dollars more in fees and expenses than a slightly higher interest rate loan. \n For example, you will be charged an origination fee on your loan. This is a percentage of the total value of the loan and is usually around one percent. If you were offered two loans with the same interest rate of 4.5 percent, but the first charges a 1.5 percent origination fee compared to the second's one percent origination fee, you would be better off choosing the second loan., Compare your lenders' offered interest rates and fees structures for the type of loan you are seeking. Obviously, you should go with the reputable lender that offers you the cheapest combination of interest rates and fees. \n Understand each loan type the mortgage lender is offering. There's a great deal of difference in a 30-year fixed-rate and a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), mainly that the interest rate in the ARM stands to change unexpectedly. Know the difference and feel confident in the explanation provided by the mortgage lender., Ask them to lock in the interest rate and fees you've negotiated and draw up a contract. Make sure to ask if your good faith estimate rates and fee structure still stand., Make sure you look at the fine print to ensure that you are getting the loan terms and fees that you have negotiated. Pay special attention to what happens if the loan doesn't go through. It is a serious red flag if the "good faith" or "earnest money" deposit you give the lender in advance is kept by the lender in the event that the loan doesn't go through. \n Again, ask for an explanation if there are any unexpected fees or confusingly worded statements in the contract.
\n These are usually provided when you are hired; if not, ask for them. If you are union, ask your union representative for a copy of your union contract. \n If your boss refuses to write these directions, write a memo to your boss including the new directions and explain the way in which the new directions conflict with your job description, and ask if your understanding is an accurate reflection of the new instructions s/he gave you. \n Share these notes with your boss in memos, asking if you have understood correctly. Be sure to include time and date of the discussion. \n If your boss continues to provide inappropriate directions, copy an HR manager on future memos to your boss in which you ask for clarification. \n If you are accused of having done something inappropriate, ask to see evidence and do not discuss the matter until evidence is provided. Just say the charge is incorrect and there is nothing to discuss unless there is tangible evidence — not just someone's word. \n If you are accused of having done something inappropriate and you belong to a union, contact your union representative immediately and ask for their participation in any future meetings regarding the charge. If you are in management or have no union, continue to deny the charge and refuse to discuss the situation until tangible evidence is provided. \n If there is a written record of the charge, do not sign it under any circumstances. If you are coerced into signing, write on the document that you disagree with its content, but DO NOT SIGN. \n If you think you are being discriminated against, contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in your area (see link below). \n Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly and avoid consuming addictive substances. \n 
 Do preliminary research by using numerous sources such as the internet, other people and by reading articles relating to your subject that other journalists have written. This will enable you to ask knowledgeable and well thought out questions.\n Define and clarify the purpose of your interview. Use short, open-ended questions that will encourage your subject to elaborate. Prepare more questions than you think you will need. \n Ask the interviewee for consent before turning on your recorder. Bring spare batteries. \n Introduce yourself and give your subject information about who you work for, why you are conducting the interview and what you hope to gain from it. \n Put the person at ease by finding some common ground or interests. Make sure your body language is open and relaxed. \n This will help you build a full and descriptive picture for the reader. \n Start with surface questions then slowly delve deeper as rapport is established. Delay any sensitive questions until you feel that your subject is relaxed and open. Be assertive and curious but not too invasive or aggressive. \n If they are waffling, politely redirect the interview with some specific questioning. \n Refer back to your notes or questions occasionally to ensure that you are on track. \n This will ensure that you don’t repeat something and end up looking stupid, which could cause your subject to view you in a negative light. \n If your subject can’t provide the details you need but knows someone who can, get their information and establish contact straight away. \n Ask for clarification and details. \n Don't leave the interview feeling like you could have got more out of it. \n Don’t take everything at face value; check your facts, statements and figures before publishing them. \n Read through them and check to see if there is anything you have missed. If you need additional detail get in touch with your subject as soon as possible. \n 
 Buy a brand new journal and use it only for career-related entries. Have it with you when you conduct career research. Makes notes not only about the information you locate during your research, but you personal thoughts and feelings about what you’ve found. Write down questions that arise while doing your research and work to get answers for them. Practice job interview questions and answers. Makes notes about things that went well and didn’t go well in interviews. Your career journal can be as structured or carefree as you want. There are no set rules as to what it should or should not contain. Allow it to reflect your personality so you’ll feel comfortable writing in it on a regular basis.\n There are many places you can go to research different types of jobs and careers, including your guidance counsellor, a university career center, a career coaches and websites, government websites, journals and magazines, newspapers, blogs, books, and more. Start by selecting one or two of these options and investigate the details regarding a career in medicine, specifically oncology. \n Learn about the details of what the job does, what type of work environment they have, educational requirements, potential pay ranges, and even what the future job market may look like.Read the advice and opinions of people who are already medical doctors and oncologists, possibly via personal blogs or a day in the life of articles.Record your findings, ideas and questions in your career journal. \n All major hospitals and medical clinics will have formal volunteer programs. Contact the volunteer coordinator and determine the application process. Apply for a volunteer position. Focus on departments or organizations related to oncology. \n Consider volunteering for a local cancer charity event, like a marathon, golf tournament, or daffodil days.Use the opportunity to speak with cancer patients and their families. \n Consider volunteering at a camp for children with cancer.Use the opportunity not only to make the kid’s happy, but to see how the disease affects children and the potential you have to help them in the future. \n While volunteering think about what it would be like to be in a similar environment on a regular basis. What sorts of things bother you? Can you overcome them? Do you find it emotionally difficult to deal with the patients? Use this as a learning experience to help assess if oncology is still the right career goal for you. \n You will definitely have the opportunity to do something like this while in medical school, but you may want to complete a job shadow at least once before medical school to gain a better understanding of what an oncologist does on a daily basis. Some hospitals may have formal job shadowing programs, but you can also reach out personally to a department or doctor to request a job shadow.The volunteer program at a hospital, or the career center at a medical school, may be able to recommend a specific oncologist to contact directly. Or they may be able to provide you with a formal process to follow to sign up. \n Bring your career journal with you to take notes. As a job shadower, you’re there to observe, not necessarily participate. Watch what goes on and write down your questions, ideas and observations. \n Once the doctor is finished with his/her patients, go over your questions with them. There are no bad questions. \n Dress appropriately. If you’re in a hospital setting you’ll probably be on your feet for a long time, so make sure you’re comfortable. But also dress professionally as you want to project a respectful image to both the doctor and the patients. \n Write about your experiences in your career journal. \n Send the doctor you shadowed, and anyone else who helped make it happen, a thank you card afterwards. Maybe throw in a coffee gift card too - no doubt every doctor would appreciate coffee! \n Be very respectful of the patients. Information you learn that is of a personal nature will be confidential and you should not talk about it with anyone other than the doctor your shadowing. Do not assume every patient is going to want you around, allow the doctor to introduce you and if the patient is uncomfortable, wait outside the room. \n A mentor is someone who is an experienced oncologist who has agreed to advise and counsel you about oncology and an oncology career.You may not be able to obtain a mentor such as this until your internship or residency as a mentee really should be pursuing the career already. \n Formal mentoring programs do exist. If your medical school or hospital has one, definitely take advantage of it. If they don’t, actively seek out a mentor informally by becoming involved with the work of an oncologist you admire.Use your career journal to make notes of your observations, ideas and questions. \n Remember to look at your career journal on a regular basis. Determine if you have any outstanding questions you'd like answered - and get them answered. Write down any new thoughts and ideas that have come to mind since the last time you wrote in your journal. Keep track of any experiences you've had that are career-related, even if they aren't specifically related to medicine. Reevaluate your career goals and/or plans if you feel they've changed., Most universities do not have formal pre-med programs. And in fact, medical schools, in general, do not require a specific undergraduate degree in order to apply. As harsh as it sounds, medical schools are more interested in your overall GPA and your MCAT score. Therefore, your goal in choosing an undergraduate program should be that it helps you achieve the highest GPA and MCAT scores possible.Review pre-med program rankings. There are many organizations that rank colleges and universities in different ways, including what schools have the best pre-med program. While you certainly don’t need to apply to the best, if you can, you should.When selecting a program consider the following: Does the program prepare me properly for the MCAT? Does the program maximize my chances of getting the best GPA possible? Does the program help me obtain another career if I don’t end up in medical school? Does the program help me in medical school?Your undergraduate program doesn’t have to be in biology, or even science. If you can get better grades by completing an undergraduate humanities degree, go for it. \n Use the Association of American Medical College’s (AAMC) Pre-Med Coursework Worksheet to select a program that will allow you to complete all the course requirements. \n If you’ve selected your program based on school rankings, skip this step. Once you’ve figured out what type of degree program you want to pursue, you now have to find a place to pursue it. Determine if you have any specific restrictions that limit your choices - i.e. financial, geographical, etc. Eliminate any schools do not offer the program you want, or include the restrictions you’ve identified.Make a list of all the possible undergraduate schools that meet your criteria. Write down what your priorities for an undergraduate school are - for example, low cost, far away from home, also has a medical school, great pubs, etc. - and then rank them. Score each school against your priorities, then rank the schools. Select your top 20 or so schools to investigate further. \n Obtain undergraduate admissions packages from each of your selected schools and review them. \n Sign-up and attend local school information sessions, if they’re offered. \n Sign-up and attend on-campus school tours and discipline-specific information sessions.If possible, speak to a current or former student and ask their opinion about the school. \n If possible, speak to a couple of current professors in your programs of interest and ask why you should attend that particular school. \n Speak to your high school guidance or university counsellor for advice. \n Review university/college rankings. \n Assess each school (using your career journal) and make a final ranking. \n Select how many schools you’re going to submit an application for. There is no real limit to how many applications you submit, except money and time. Each application comes with a fee, which is anywhere between $40 and $100. While there is no general consensus on the ideal number, the most common number is between 6 and 14.If in doubt, go with your gut! \n Over 500 colleges accept something called The Common Application, which, when used, can significantly reduce the amount of time required to apply to an undergraduate program. If you are applying to one or more of the Common Application member schools, you can complete the application process on their website and will only need to complete the standard portions of the application once. For any schools who are not Common Application members, you will need to go to their admissions website to complete the application. For the purpose of an example, we’ll use Rutgers University, which does not accept the Common Application. \n Go to the university’s undergraduate admissions website and find the location of the online application portal. Go to the online portal and register for an account. \n Check the admissions website for application deadlines for the term you’d like to start - most commonly it would be the fall term, starting in September. The timeline will also include the date by which a decision is made and communicated to you, and the date by which you have to tell the university if you’re going to attend. \n Take note of the required application fee, and how it is to be paid. Most universities will require the fee to be paid before they’ll even look at your application. \n Look for an application checklist which will list all the items you’ll need to submit or do for the application. The checklist will normally include additional items like your self-reported academic record or high school transcripts and SAT/ACT scores. Make sure you have these items ready, or have already electronically submitted them to the university. \n Review the requirements for an admissions essay, including how it needs to be submitted. Write a first draft of your essay and then have someone (like a parent or guidance counsellor) review it. Revise, edit and complete your essay. \n Review whether your application will require a list of extracurricular activities, which would include employment, community service/volunteering, athletics, etc. \n Review whether your application will require letters of recommendation. If required, determine how many you need, and who they have to be from (i.e. teachers, parents, employers, etc.). Select whom you’d like to have write you a letter and ask them. Remember to send them a thank you once they’ve submitted the letter! Note that in some cases letters of references must be submitted directly to the university from the referee. \n Log into the admissions application portal and complete the application, then submit it. \n Keep track of the decision dates that were outlined on the university’s admissions website. There may be multiple dates if the university allows for early admissions application. Most universities will provide a decision in the online admissions portal where you submitted your application, or via a specific email address that you registered for. Check the online portal (at least) after the decision deadlines to determine which schools you’ve been accepted to. \n In general you’ll get one of three types of responses - accepted, rejected or waitlisted. \n You are not required to confirm your acceptance before May 1st (for fall admission), so don’t make any final decisions until you’ve received responses from all your applications.Once you’ve received all responses, accept the offer from the highest ranked school you determined in previous steps - unless you’ve changed your mind. \n Acceptances are usually followed by an enrolment or registration deposit to hold your spot at the school. You should only submit an acceptance and enrolment deposit to one school.After you’ve been accepted you’ll normally receive invitations to come (back) to the school for tours and events. Attending them isn’t required, but you’ll certainly view the school differently now that you know you’ll be attending! \n The most important part to remember throughout school is to ensure you’ve completed all the required prerequisite courses for your medical school application.Keep track of your GPA. Consider dropping a course before the appropriate deadline (the deadline by which you can drop a course and it will not appear on your transcript) if you think you’ll end up with a bad grade. \n All medical school applications will want to know about your non-academic activities, including awards, employment, volunteer work, sports, school groups, etc.Follow the AAMC’s Timeline for Application/Admission to Medical School PDF to make sure you complete as many extracurricular activities as you can that will be helpful for medical school admission. \n Apply for medical or science-related internships during the summer months. \n Apply for research assistantship positions (paid or unpaid) during the summer and school terms. \n All medical schools will require at least 2-3 letters of recommendation from someone who knows your abilities and skills. Letters from university professors, doctors, deans and associate deans, etc., are normally required.Volunteering in a professor’s lab, or working in a medical research centre, will make sure the professor knows you well enough to write a letter. \n The MCAT, or Medical College Admissions Test, is a standard test required by all medical schools. It is administered via the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). The AAMC recommends taking the MCAT once you have completed any coursework that is relevant to the subjects on the test.However, each medical school will have its own requirements as to how old the score can be when you apply - the norm is 2-3 years old maximum. \n The AAMC provides a timeline that can help you plan when to register for the MCAT, when to take it and when to apply to medical school. \n The AAMC implemented a new MCAT in 2015, which replaces their previous version from 1991. If you took the MCAT before 2015, it is very important that you check the Medical school policies for accepting scores from the current and the new MCAT exams PDF. Some medical schools will only accept the 2015 version of the MCAT as of certain admissions cycles. \n While not required, it is strongly recommended that you take some sort of prep course for writing the MCAT. The way the test is laid out, and the way in which it is timed, are very important and knowing this in advance is extremely helpful. Most prep courses also hold one or more fake exams to give you an idea of what it’ll be like in the real thing. \n You can take the MCAT more than once, if you feel you didn’t do well the first time.However, be aware that some medical schools will actually combine the averages of the scores if the test was taken more than once (and you cannot prevent this)., There are over 170 accredited medical schools in the United States.Several medical school rankings exist that help determine which schools are better than others, based on a variety of factors.There are also a number of tools found online that can help you evaluate which medical school(s) are right for you.In the end, however, selecting a medical school will be similar to when you selected an undergraduate school. You may have restrictions, such as financial, geographical, etc., that may limit which schools you can apply to. \n Make a list of all the possible medical schools - in your career journal - that meet your criteria. Write down what your priorities for a medical school are - for example, cost, reputation, class sizes, research programs, faculty, etc. - and then rank them. Score each school against your priorities, then rank the schools. \n Read all the information about each medical school on their websites. \n Attend any seminars, webinars or information sessions held by the medical school. Ask questions. \n Book a campus tour at each medical school, if possible. \n Seek the advice of your professors, school career advisors and alumni. \n Review the medical school rankings. \n Assess each school (using your career journal) and make a final ranking. \n Determine how many applications you’re going to submit. In 2014, over 170 medical schools in the U.S. received 731,595 applications, yet they only graduated 20,343 students in the same year.That’s less than a 3% admissions rate! As with undergraduate programs, there is no limit to the number of medical schools you can apply, but the fees associated with these applications are much higher ($160 for the first one plus $36 for each additional one).If you can afford it, you should try to apply to all the medical schools that interest you. \n If in doubt, go with your gut! \n Contact the people who you’d like to write your letters of recommendation and request the letters. Since you might ask one referee to send a letter to more than one school, it will probably be helpful to create a list of the medical schools and the mailing addresses for the letters and send this list to each referee. They’ll probably use the same basic letter for each school, but preparing them will take time.Letters of recommendation have to mailed directly from the referee to the medical school, so don’t have your referees send the letters back to you. \n All medical school applications can be submitted via the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) and/or the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS). These services allow you to submit one full application and send it to as many medical schools as you want.The first application will cost $160 and each additional medical school will cost $36.\n Log into the website, when ready, and enter all the information requested while following the instruction manual.Submit the application online, when completed, and pay all the associated application fees.Check your AMCAS and/or AACOMAS account(s) regularly to check the status of each application and submit any additional information that is requested., Some, but not all, medical schools will require an interview as part of the admissions process. Some interviews may be conducted on the phone or via the internet, but many are done in person.Book your travel to/from each medical school. \n For each medical school for which an interview is requested, print out and complete the Mission & Interview Question Worksheet from the AAMC website. \n For each medical school for which an interview is requested, review their website and read any information they have posted regarding the interview. \n Review your career journal and determine if you have any outstanding questions you wanted to ask during the interview. \n Review the admissions websites for each medical to which you have applied and check the timeline for when you can expect an admission offer and the deadline for when you have to accept the offer.If you’ve been accepted to more than one medical school, check how you ranked the schools and accept the school that you ranked highest - unless you’ve changed your mind. \n In general medical school will take 4 years to complete, and those 4 years are very structured.Your first year, and possibly some or all of your second year, will include mainly coursework. Your second and/or third years will include actual clinical experience where you’ll rotate among most of the major medical disciplines. Your third and/or your last year will be spent on a project that will include additional clinical experience, but this time in a specific discipline of your interest. \n Your scholarly project is where you can focus on oncology as a specialty, and be assigned to one or more oncologists as an advisor or mentor., There are three main types of oncologists - medical, radiation and surgical. In addition, there are also oncologists who specialize in gynecology, pediatrics and hematology.Based on your experiences in medical school, select which type of oncology you’d like to focus on - this will help narrow down residency options. \n By this point in your medical education, you’ll have met a lot of medical doctors, specialists, and professors, not to mention fellow students. All of these are sources for ideas on where to do a residency. Do some additional research online and determine what your priorities are for a residency - then compare those priorities to the programs offered. Select more than one program to which to apply. \n There are many things to consider regarding a residency, including: the stability of the program (does it have a future?), what type of support you get in the program, how flexible is the program schedule, what is the reputation of the institution, does it provide you with the possibility of advancement after it done, location, and more., Review all the prerequisites and requirements of the application and ensure you have them all in order. Write a draft of your personal statement, walk away for at least 24 hours and come back and revise it. Ask someone (professor, doctor, fellow student) to review your statement for you and provide feedback. Update and finalize your CV. Submit your applications via the method indicated for each program.Many residency programs use the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) which helps potential residents and residency programs find each other.Many residency programs also use the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) as a centralized method to receive applications and documentation from applicants., Just like medical school, every residency program will want to interview you before offering your admission to their program. At this level it is likely you’ll need to attend the interview in person, but some programs may help pay the cost of travel., Your residency offers (or matches in this case) will come through the ERAS system where you submitted your application. All residency matches are released on Match Day which is the third Friday of March each year.Due to how the system works, you should receive only one offer - based on how your ranked each programs, and how each program ranked you. You are required to accept that offer, which means you have to be very care how many programs you select, and how you rank them., The experiences you gain in your residency program are vital to your career as an oncologist. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you have any. Use your residency to enlarge your professional network and learn about potential fellowships and full-time jobs. \n The USMLE is a three-step examination that tests potential doctor’s on their skills in medicine and patient care. Medical licenses are granted by each state, not nationally, but each state requires the USMLE as a requirement to licensing.Use the Licensing Examination Services portal of the National Board of Medical Examiners to register for Steps 1 or 2 of the examination. \n Step 1 and Step 2 CK exams cost $590 each, Step 2 CK costs $1250, Step 3 costs $815..Step 1 is normally taken after your second year of medical school, while Step 2 is normally taken after your fourth year of medical school. Step 3 is taken while you’re completing your residency.The process to apply for Step 3 of the examination differs between states, but you can use the Federation of State Medical Boards online portal to register and pay for the Step 3 exam. \n Each state has its own medical board which controls licensing of doctors, therefore each state has slightly different requirements for obtaining a license. Find the medical board’s website for the state where you will be practicing and review the licensing procedure.We will use the state of Colorado as our example for obtaining your medical license. \n The state of Colorado requires that you have malpractice insurance in the state ‘’’before’’’ you apply for your license.Obtain malpractice insurance if you do not already have it, or determine if you meet one of the exception requirements. \n The state of Colorado requires that each applicant meet the following qualifications: proof of graduation from medical school, passage of USMLE or other national exam, completion of postgraduate education (i.e. residency) and reference letters from places where you have previously practiced.Twenty-three states use the Federation of State Medical Boards’ Uniform Application for potential licensees.The Uniform Application is essentially a centralized, online application portal for submitting license requirements. The nice thing about the Uniform Application is that once you’ve completed one application it can be sent to any of the states that participate in the program., Medical oncologists must complete a three-year residency in internal medicine and then complete a two-year fellowship in medical oncology. Surgical oncologists must complete a five-year residency in general surgery and then complete a two-year fellowship in surgical oncology. Radiation oncologists complete a five-year radiation oncology program (residency) but do not need to complete a fellowship., Board certification is not a requirement to practice medicine or oncology. However, board certification will most likely increase your reputation and job potential. \n Medical oncology is certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM). \n Radiation oncology is certified by either the The American Board of Radiology or The American Board of Physician Specialties. \n Surgical oncology is certified by the The American Board of Medical Specialties. \n During your residency and/or fellowship you would have developed an extensive professional network. Use your network to determine if there are any oncologist positions available in your favoured locations. Search for oncology positions on your own using any and all resources available to you. \n The Journal of Clinical Oncology, as an example, has an online Oncology Career Centre with oncology-related positions available in the United States, and around the world. Each posting will provide you with instructions on how to apply to that specific position. \n The Society of Surgical Oncology, as another example, has a career website that specialized in surgical oncologist positions available in the United States. Each posting will provide instructions on how to apply to that specific position. \n Remember that if you apply to and accept a position in a state other than where you're licensed, you will need to obtain a license to practice medicine in that state before you can begin practicing. \n Take advantage of the career centers and advisors available at your medical school to help you find oncology positions. Use their help to update your CV, craft cover letters and personal statements, and practice for interviews.
 In order to build a basic robot, you'll need several simple components. You can find most, if not all, of these components at your local electronics hobby shop, or at a number of online retailers. Some basic kits may include all of these components as well. This robot does not require any soldering: \n Arduino Uno (or other microcontroller) \n 2 continuous rotation servos \n 2 wheels that fit the servos \n 1 caster roller \n 1 small solderless breadboard (look for a breadboard that has two positive and negative lines on each side) \n 1 distance sensor (with four-pin connector cable) \n 1 mini push button switch \n 1 10kΩ resistor \n 1 USB A to B cable \n 1 set of breakaway headers \n 1 6 x AA battery holder with 9V DC power jack \n 1 pack of jumper wires or 22-gauge hook-up wire \n Strong double-sided tape or hot glue\n You'll be building the robot's body using the battery pack as a base. \n This should be the end that the battery pack's wire is coming out of The servos should be touching bottoms, and the rotating mechanisms of each should be facing out the sides of the battery pack. It's important that the servos are properly aligned so that the wheels go straight. The wires for the servos should be coming off the back of the battery pack. \n Make sure that they are solidly attached to the battery pack. The backs of the servos should be aligned flush with the back of the battery pack. \n The servos should now be taking up the back half of the battery pack. \n It should hang over the front of the battery pack just a little bit, and will extend beyond each side. Make sure that it is securely fastened before proceeding. The "A" row should be closest to the servos. \n If you attached the servos properly, there should be a flat space made by them touching. Stick the Arduino board onto this flat space so that the Arduino's USB and Power connectors are facing the back (away from the breadboard). The front of the Arduino should be just barely overlapping the breadboard. \n Firmly press the wheels onto the rotating mechanism of the servo. This may require a significant amount of force, as the wheels are designed to fit as tightly as possible for the best traction. \n If you flip the chassis over, you should see a bit of breadboard extending past the battery pack. Attach the caster to this extended piece, using risers if necessary. The caster acts as the front wheel, allowing the robot to easily turn in any direction.If you bought a kit, the caster may have come with a few risers that you can use to ensure the caster reaches the ground. \n You'll be using these to connect the servos to the breadboard. Push the pins down through the header so that the pins come out in an equal distance on both sides. \n Make sure that they are firmly inserted. \n This will connect the servos to the breadboard. Make sure the left servo is connected to the left header, and the right servo to the right header. \n Make sure you use the red rail on the back of the breadboard (closer to the rest of the chassis). \n Make sure that you use the blue rail on the back of the breadboard. Do not plug them into the red rail pins. \n This will allow the Arduino to control the servos and turn the wheels. \n It does not get plugged into the outer power rails on the breadboard, but instead into the first row of lettered pins (J). Make sure you place it in the exact center, with an equal number of pins available on each side. \n This will ground the sensor. \n This will power the sensor. \n This will feed information from the sensor to the microcontroller. \n Orient it so that the battery pack cable is coming out to the left at the bottom. \n Make absolutely sure that the battery pack is oriented correctly. \n These two cables will help provide the correct voltage to the Arduino. \n The black cable should be plugged into the blue rail pin at pin 30. The red cable should be plugged into the red rail pin at pin 30. \n Connect it at pin 28 on the blue rail. \n Do not connect the red rails, as you will likely damage the Arduino. \n This will provide the power to the Arduino. \n This switch will allow you to turn off the robot without having to unplug the power. \n This will power the button. \n Connect it to the pin directly next to the black wire that you connected a few steps ago. \n This will allow the Arduino to register the push button. \n This is the Arduino development environment, and allows you to program instructions that you can then upload to your Arduino microcontroller. You can download it for free from arduino.cc/en/main/software. Unzip the downloaded file by double-clicking it and move the folder inside to an easy to access location. You won't be actually installing the program. Instead, you'll just run it from the extracted folder by double-clicking arduino.exe. \n Plug the battery back jack into the connector on the Arduino to give it power. \n Windows will likely not recognize the device. \n This will launch the Device Manager. \n If you don't see this option, click "Properties" instead, select the "Driver" tab, and then click "Update Driver." \n This will allow you to select the driver that came with the Arduino IDE. \n You'll find a "drivers" folder inside. \n You'll be greeted with a blank project. \n The code below will make your Arduino continuously move forward. \n #include <Servo.h> // this adds the "Servo" library to the program \n \n // the following creates two servo objects \n Servo leftMotor\n Servo rightMotor\n \n void setup() \n { \n leftMotor.attach(12); // if you accidentally switched up the pin numbers for your servos, you can swap the numbers here \n rightMotor.attach(13)\n } \n \n \n void loop() \n { \n leftMotor.write(180); // with continuous rotation, 180 tells the servo to move at full speed "forward." \n rightMotor.write(0); // if both of these are at 180, the robot will go in a circle because the servos are flipped. "0" tells it to move full speed "backwards." \n } \n Click the right arrow button in the upper-left corner to build and upload the program to the connected Arduino. \n You may want to lift the robot off of the surface, as it will just continue to move forward once the program is uploaded. \n Add the following code to the "void loop()" section of your code to enable the kill switch, above the "write()" functions. \n if(digitalRead(2) == HIGH) // this registers when the button is pressed on pin 2 of the Arduino \n { \n while(1) \n { \n leftMotor.write(90); // "90" is neutral position for the servos, which tells them to stop turning \n rightMotor.write(90)\n } \n } \n With the kill switch code added, you can upload and test the robot. It should continue to drive forward until you press the switch, at which point it will stop moving. The full code should look like this: \n #include <Servo.h> \n \n // the following creates two servo objects \n Servo leftMotor\n Servo rightMotor\n \n void setup() \n { \n leftMotor.attach(12)\n rightMotor.attach(13)\n } \n \n \n void loop() \n { \n if(digitalRead(2) == HIGH) \n { \n while(1) \n { \n leftMotor.write(90)\n rightMotor.write(90)\n } \n } \n \n leftMotor.write(180)\n rightMotor.write(0)\n } \n 
 If you want to make a patterned rug, choose the colors you will use.\n Use a utility knife to cut out the rug, pressing firmly. You may have to make 2 passes with the knife. \n The carpet used for the patterns should be of the same type and texture as the background carpet. \n Brown paper bags or butcher's paperwork well for this. \n Use a utility knife to cut out the shapes, pressing firmly. You may have to make 2 passes with the knife. \n Trace it with a felt tipped marker. \n Work from the underside of the rug, pressing the cut out pieces firmly into the base. \n You will probably have a lot of carpet fibers showing on the underside of the rug. They can be integrated into the rug by taking a flat head screwdriver and running it around the edges where the carpet pieces meet. \n You can also use duct tape. \n Lay down a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) line of carpet glue along the edges of the rug. \n Allow to dry thoroughly. \n Pull the edging firmly up the side of the rug and onto the bead of glue on top, pressing firmly. \n
\n b may also not equal 1, due to Addition and Multiplication both being subject to the Law of Commutation.\n Let a+b = 10+ 10/9 = 90/9 +10/9 = 100/9 = x \n Let a*b = 10/1*10/9 = 100/9 = x √ check they are equal. \n Let a^2 /(a-1) = 10^2 /9 = 100/9 = x √ \n Let b^2 / (b-1) = (10/9)^2 / (10/9 - 9/9) = 100/81 / 1/9 = 100/81 * 9/1 = 100/9 = x √ \n \n Let a+b+c = 10 + 10/9 + 1.0989010989011 = y = 12.2100122100122 \n Let a*b*c = 10 * 10/9 * 1.0989010989011 = y = 12.2100122100122 √ \n \n Let a+b+c+d = 10+10/9 +1.0989010989011 +1.08920596884871 = e=13.2992181788609 \n Let a*b*c*d = 10 *10/9 *1.0989010989011 * 1.08920596884871 = e=13.2992181788609√ \n Problem solved √ \n so long as the area has 1 unit of thickness. \n Notice that Addition and Multiplication are both Commutative, and we might just as easily have started off by subtracting a from both sides instead of b. However, Subtraction is NOT commutative, e.g. 7-4 does not equal 4-7. \n Find it is equally true for a+b=a*b that b/(b-1) = a. Also notice that if a+b = a*b = w, then a^2 /(a-1) = b^2 / (b-1) = w. This has the property of Symmetry, which is a very hot item in Mathematics these days! \n \n For more art charts and graphs, you might also want to click on Category:Algebra, Category:Mathematics, Category:Spreadsheets or Category:Graphics to view many Excel worksheets and charts where Trigonometry, Geometry and Calculus have been turned into Art, or simply click on the category as appears in the upper right white portion of this page, or at the bottom left of the page. \n 
 Try to get into the mindset of the religions you are studying. You may also want to listen to both arguments for and against the religion. \n There is a sender and a receiver, as well as a channel of communication. In particular, "meaning is created in the receiver end based on the layers of information already there rather than those explicitly sent by the sender." \n The second fork comes inside the religions as a division between Abrahamic religions and other religions. The third fork comes between Indo-Iranian religions of Zoroaster, Hinduism, and Buddhism on one side and ancient and tribal religions (known as paganism) on the other side. \n In particular, they have had a lot of influence within the literature of European languages. This will need separate endeavour and commitment. \n In fact, an offshoot of Zoroastrianism known as Mithra-ism has given much to Christian rituals, such as Sunday, Christmas and Easter., For Christianity these may be Catholic, Protestant, Evangelical, Orthodox, Baptist, Lutheran, Calvinist, L.D.S, Humanist; Islam : Sunni , Shi'a, Deobandi, Salafi (Wahhabi), Reformist, Quraniyun, Barelvi, Ahl Al-Hadith, Islamist. Judaism: Hasidic, Sephardic, Reformist, Masorti, Orthodox and the Many "sects" in Hinduism. \n
 The type of milk you decide to use to make the yogurt will determine the fat content of the yogurt. Whole milk will give you the creamiest yogurt.\n (29.6 ml) of the milk to be used later on. \n (1.86 l) of milk into a saucepan with a heavy bottom. Heat the milk on the stove top on medium heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon while it is heating. \n This is just before it starts to boil. Use a candy thermometer to keep track of the milk's temperature while it heats. \n Place it uncovered on a cooling rack. Wait until the temperature of the milk reaches 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 degrees Celsius), approximately 45 minutes. \n If you have an oven that you can set at very low temperatures, set it to approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 degrees Celsius). Place an oven thermometer inside so you can be sure it is between 100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 and 43.3 degrees Celsius). \n (29.6 ml) of milk you reserved earlier with 2.5 tbsp. (37 ml) of plain store-bought yogurt. Stir them together in a small glass with a fork or spoon. \n Make sure that the yogurt label lists active cultures. This will serve as your yogurt "starter." \n Stir well until it is thoroughly combined. \n Place the lid over the mixture and a dishtowel over the top to keep it from overheating. Put the bowl in the oven. \n If the temperature goes above 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 degrees Celsius), the active yogurt cultures will be killed. If the temperature goes below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius), the active cultures will not grow and your milk will not be converted into yogurt. \n Many people choose to leave it overnight. \n If it has not thickened, place it back in the oven and wait a few more hours. If it has, turn the oven light or element off. \n There will not necessarily be a watery portion. Place the bowl in the refrigerator for 2 hours, giving it time to thicken. \n Place the lined strainer in a large bowl. You can use a colander, but make sure it has a concentration of holes at the bottom, rather than the sides. \n Place it back in the refrigerator for 1 hour. The whey will accumulate in the bowl underneath the strainer. \n You can pour the whey down the drain or reserve it for other recipes. Replace the bowl under the strainer and place them both back in the refrigerator. \n Pour away the whey. Spoon the mixture into an airtight container. \n Reserve 2.5 tbsp. (37 ml) of the yogurt to use as a starter for your next batch of yogurt. \n 
 When buying a new pair of jeans, several factors have to be taken into account: do you want the latest trendy look, i.e skinny jeans or do you want comfort? Age does play a part here I have to say, you do NOT want to look like MDAL (Mutton dressed as lamb), or a fashion victim; Also forget shredded, ripped at the knees or anything too tacky.\n Maybe: it depends on the colour. Hot pink I would say only suits the under 18s but a dark green or black could be just what the doctor ordered. \n This enables you to see the leg length and how much hem needs taking up, if any. \n And if you need to lie on the floor to do the zip up, trust me, you need a bigger size! Muffin tops are so not a good look. \n i.e a size 8 in one brand will be a size 10 in another; I have pairs of jeans that are labelled 3 different sizes, from 3 different designer brands and they all fit me. \n Waist not digging in? Knees not feeling like their wrapped in clingfilm? Good; these may be the ones for you... Ask your friend what she honestly thinks. \n Machine washing is fine. Use delicate settings for your jeans as they last longer this way. \n
 For extreme laziness, use a stool or chair that has rollers on the bottoms, so you can glide easily from the table to the sink, without even getting up or moving anything but your arms.\n There are a few chores that can't be managed on your backside, for everything else hoover from the comfort of your office recliner\n The more they can see how happy these things make you, the more likely it is they will gladly do it again. You could say: "No one makes lasagna quite like you, it fills my heart full of wonder, and my taste buds feel like they are dancing on the wings of an angel."The essential rule with laziness is that flattery will get you everywhere! \n Spend most of this time doing nothing, but create plenty of mess. Come up with a set of fictional complications that have made it a much harder job than expected. \n When their backs are turned, simply kick back, and relax. \n Organize the jobs you are putting off into a hierarchy. If you need to both tidy your room, and complete a vital work assignment, always opt for the tidying first (even if you do just hide the mess). The satisfaction of completing an entire task will put your lazy mind at rest. The lesson here is to always leave the lengthiest jobs till last! \n Very subtly, try to sabotage their jobs. Drop a few crumbs after they have vacuumed. Sneak in a red sock when they help with someone else washing, and slyly dirty up their dishes the moment they have cleaned them. However, it is vital to never be caught on a sabotage mission. \n Gather in the living room, settle down with a film keeping snacks and drinks to hand. \n
 The following list explains exactly what is needed (also see Things You'll Need below for the crafting items): \n At least 34 diapers (newborn or early stage) \n 2 receiving blankets \n 2 bibs, a chain linked toy (appropriate for a newborn or infant) \n 1 pair of infant socks \n 1 baby bottle \n 1 washcloth \n 1 plush stuffed toy (that does not contain buttons or any items that could pose a choking hazard).\n Start by lining one side and stacking the diapers on their side so they sit upright, but placed horizontally. As you build up one wall side, migrate to the other side of the pan and build up that area. \n Keep creating the swirl shape. \n Wrap one of the rubber bands or soft elastic loops around the perimeter of the diapers. \n You may want to ask a friend to help with this because if a single diaper slips from the band, you’ll have to start the process all over again! \n Do this inside the pan the same way you designed the first swirl. \n Add the rubber band around the diapers, then gingerly lift the tire from the pan and set next to the first diaper tire. \n Cover the rubber band or elastic loop with the ribbon. This improves the look and helps to give the impression of a tire. \n Pin the ribbon in place, leaving the pin at the bottom of the tire so it doesn’t show. \n If necessary, iron the blanket to remove wrinkles. \n The roll must be tight enough to fit in the middle of the diaper tire hole. Pin the blanket roll in place. \n Match the ends so the blanket is hanging out half and half. The roll must remain in place, so pin each end of the blanket if necessary. \n Join the blanket from the first diaper tire to the second tire. Align the tires next to each other so they form the base of the motorcycle. \n Tuck the end of the blanket into the hole of the second diaper tire. Pull gently so the blanket easily holds the two tires in place. \n Add a pin on the ends of the blanket to ensure the blanket stays in place inside the tires. \n Then roll the blanket the same way you rolled the first blanket. \n Slide the blanket completely through the hole until both blanket ends meet. \n Keep the graphic or child’s name visible and facing outward. \n Slide the ring toy through the top so they hold the two blanket ends. Slide the toy until it is almost all the way down to the diaper tire. \n Check that it fits snugly. \n Slide a small piece of rolled-up light cardboard inside each handlebar roll. \n Try to pin in place if they don’t hold naturally. \n You may need to pin the toy in place, especially if the toy is pliable. \n You now have a fun, cute and very useful gift to give to the expectant mom. \n 
 Even better, have more than 5. \n There are many roles needed for this game. Police officer, jail attendant (can be a police officer or someone else), suspect(s) and base attendant., You need a room for the base, the suspects house, the court and the jail. Choose these according to your house. Tips on the best rooms are in the tips section below., Ask them not to lock the door. Have them lean heavily on the door instead., Have them say this rather loud, but not shouting., Or, they can continue leaning against the door, and have the police try to force it open., This is extremely difficult if you have (a) strong suspect(s), but can be easy if your suspect(s) is/are less strong., Now, the police officer should say, "I'm arresting you for(insert crime here). You will be taken to (insert prison name here)". \n The suspect(s) will then be taken out of the room. \n As tempting as it may be, do not tie them down in any way., When your jail attendant hears this, they should pretend to call an ambulance. A police officer or the jail or base attendant can be paramedic. The suspect(s) should thrash about screaming and then suddenly faint again a number of times. The ambulance person should pretend to give them tests and jags and then they should turn their back. While their back is turned, the suspect(s) escape(s)., All police should be returned to base at this point, except for the jail attendant. The jail attendant should look away then the suspect(s) escape(s)., Bring them in to your court room and try to ask them questions. From their answers and what they did, give them a sentence, from 15 minutes to life, until their not suspect any more., After as long as you want, change roles. After you have changed, follow all steps again.
 It typically begins with sudden, severe pain — often in one joint, and most commonly in your big toe (on one side or the other). It often begins at night, and may wake you from sleep. The affected joint often appears red and swollen and may feel warm to the touch, and you will likely have a decreased range of motion around the affected joint. \n If your joint pain is of gradual onset and does not match the profile above, it is less likely to be gout. \n It may be something else, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, among other things.\n An infection may also occur concurrently alongside a gout attack, and the two are almost impossible to tell apart without diagnostic tests. \n An infected joint will likely also be sudden in onset, appear red and swollen and warm to the touch, and may be accompanied by a fever. \n You will need analysis of your joint fluid to distinguish between gout and an infection. \n"Pseudogout, also known as calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD), also presents very similarly to gout (hence its name). Again, the only way to truly differentiate pseudogout from gout is to have your joint fluid looked at under a microscope. \n If you do have gout, you will experience "attacks" of it followed by remissions (or followed by total resolution). Gout does not tend to be a persistent, chronic, and consistent condition. Rather, it either comes as a one-time attack, or a series of flare-ups and exacerbations, followed by periods of remission (or improvement). \n If the pain in your joint persists for weeks or even months, without much variability, it is likely to be another diagnosis such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. \n \n If your family members have had gout before, you are also at a heightened risk of developing gout. This, again, would increase the probability that your current joint problem is gout-related. \n Additional risk factors for gout include: being male, being a post-menopausal female, having other health conditions (namely high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems), consuming excess alcohol, being overweight, and taking certain medications (such as aspirin, diuretics, and certain immunosuppressive agents). \n Chronic gout consists of recurrent gout attacks over a prolonged period of time. It often leads to the formation of "tophi" (hard bumps under the skin in the joint area), which is a characteristic sign of chronic gout. \n The presence of tophi — that can be visually seen in a joint — is one of the cardinal signs of chronic gout (also known as "tophaceous gout"). \n This is one of the best ways to distinguish gout from other chronic arthritic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, because no other chronic forms of arthritis present with tophi. \n The medical conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis will depend significantly on whether you have only one joint affected, or multiple joints affected. The differences are as follows: \n If you have only one joint affected, it is more likely to be gout, pseudogout, or an infected joint. \n If you have multiple joints affected, it may still be gout or pseudogout. It may also be another condition, though, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. \n Lastly, if you have multiple joints affected, the probability of an infection is slim to none (as an infection normally affects only one joint at a time). \n Elevated uric acid levels heighten the likelihood that it is gout. Creatinine is a measure of kidney function. Poor kidney function may lead to inadequate uric acid clearance from your body, and the resulting build-up of uric acid may predispose you to gout. \n Note, however, that there is no direct correlation between uric acid levels on your blood test and a diagnosis of gout. \n Many people have elevated uric acid levels, but do not ever experience clinical signs or symptoms of gout. \n Similarly, many people who do have clinical signs and symptoms of gout do not who elevated levels of uric acid. \n There is a correlation, for sure, and your likelihood of gout is increased with elevated uric acid levels, but it is not required (nor is it the exclusive criteria) in the diagnosis of gout. \n She will then examine this fluid under the microscope. \n If it is gout, the microscope will show the presence of uric acid crystals. \n It is is pseudogout, the microscope will show the presence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals. \n If it is septic arthritis, the microscope will show neither uric acid crystals nor calcium pyrophosphate crystals. \n \n Although looking at synovial joint fluid under a microscope can be diagnostic of gout (if the presence of uric acid crystals is detected), it is key to understand that gout and an infection are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Therefore, even if the test comes back diagnostic for gout, an infection could still potentially be present. \n Having the synovial fluid sent for a culture will examine to see if any bacteria or other microbes grow. \n If there is an infection, the culture dish will grow the microbe, which will be diagnostic for "septic arthritis" (a diagnosis that may exist alongside gout). \n \n An x-ray can help to distinguish between gout and other arthritic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, which has a distinct appearance on x-ray. An x-ray is usually sufficient for imaging; however, in some cases, an ultrasound or a CT scan may also be of help in assessing your underlying joint problem, particularly if it does not appear to be caused by gout., Examples include Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and Naproxen (Aleve). These can be purchased over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore. \n Stronger NSAIDs may be prescribed to you by your doctor if the over-the-counter versions are insufficient to help relieve your gout. \n \n As a result, colchicine is most frequently used after an acute gout attack subsides, with the goal of preventing future gout attacks. \n Taken in low doses for preventative purposes, the side effects of colchicine are rarely problematic. \n Corticosteroids can be prescribed in pill form, or they can be injected directly into the affected joint (which is usually the better option, as you avoid the side effects that can come from taking them in pill form). \n An example of a corticosteroid is Prednisone. \n Corticosteroids are generally given in limited amounts, such as one (or minimal) injections into your affected joint, and/or a limited course of corticosteroids taken in pill form. \n The purpose of these medications is to decrease your likelihood of future gout attacks. \n Allopurinol is an example of a medication that can help to prevent excess uric acid production. \n Probenecid is an example of a medication that can aid in your kidney's ability to filter and remove uric acid from your body. \n 
 This should indicate the frequency of use and any other preferences that you should take into account.\n They may have heard what other patients prefer, or what test strips are the least expensive. \n Tell them the details on the prescription and ask what blood sugar meters and test strips are covered under your plan. \n Remember that it is better to get a blood sugar meter and diabetes supplies that are reimbursed by your insurance plan if possible. If you get a free blood sugar meter but it is not approved by your insurance company, you will end up paying for future supplies out of pocket. \n Also, ask what pharmacies are covered by your insurance. In some cases, mail order pharmacies will offer free blood sugar meters, and they are allowed to send you a 90-day supply of test strips. \n Start to do research on free meters based on the companies that are included in the list. \n You may need to do some math to figure out your out of pocket expense. \n Diabetic Living Online does comprehensive research on different types of meters, at diabeticlivingonline.com/monitoring/blood-sugar/glucose-meter-buying-guide. \n Consider other factors than cost when choosing your blood sugar monitor. For example, you may want to look for multi-site tests, so you can draw blood from places other than your finger. If you have eyesight problems, you will want a large display. If you want to track your readings, you will want a device with large memory or 1 that can be loaded on to the computer. You may choose to pay $10 to $100 for the device that will save you time, money and hassle in the future. \n Most people will get their test strips from a prescription, so they will return to the same location for their test strips. Wait to do some research before buying your first meter and strips. \n Factor how much money your health insurance company will provide to find the least expensive strips. \n Type in the name of the company and "blood sugar meter" to find the site dedicated to these products. \n In some cases, you can sign up to receive a free blood sugar meter. \n Make sure to read the fine print, to see if other purchases are necessary to receive the blood sugar meter. \n You may need to enter insurance information to receive the meter. \n Ask if they provide free meters with a regular test strip prescription. \n Make sure to specify what types of meters are covered by your insurance. \n Costco, Target, Walmart and other stores may run promotions for free meters. Switch to a different pharmacy if the promotion is good. \n Once you have received your free monitor and filled your required prescriptions, you may be able to switch back to your old pharmacy. \n Type the name of the monitor, plus the word "free" into a search engine. Look through the results to find limited-time offers. \n You may be able to find it for a lower price or for free with the purchase of test strips. \n Ask if you can apply to receive free diabetes testing supplies. \n 
 Many female writers would use pen names or their initials to avoid being judged on the basis of their gender.The same goes for a disability. Avoid talking about someone's disability unless it is directly relevant to what you are discussing. \n For example, it would be appropriate to ask questions about ADHD when interviewing a writer whose memoir focuses on her ADHD. When interviewing an author who just happens to have ADHD, it would be inappropriate, because she never put it on the table for discussion. Follow their lead regarding whether it is open for discussion.\n "Differently abled,""diffability," and "handicapable" are all euphemisms for a term which some disabled people argue shouldn't need to be avoided in the first place.Keep a factual tone and say "disabled" or "has a disability." \n Many people with disabilities do not appreciate political correctness. It comes across as silly, impersonal, and subjective. \n Most people with disabilities don't like the word "challenged" in regards to disability, such as "physically challenged."This is because disabled people are often pressured to overcome their disabilities, even if it's exhausting, painful, or impossible. \n "Special needs" is disliked by many people with disabilities, as it suggests that their needs are extra or non-essential., "person with Down Syndrome."Identity-first language uses the disability as an ordinary adjective, e.g. "blind person."When writing about an individual, use the language that they prefer, and when writing about a community, use the community's preferred language. \n Ask an individual which language they prefer. It is usually (but not always) the same as the general community preference. \n The Deaf, Blind, and Autistic communities prefer identity-first language, such as "Deaf person" over "person with deafness"The Bleeding and Blood Disorder community,and the Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) community (excluding autism),prefers person-first language, such as "person with Hemophilia" instead of "Hemophiliac." \n For a community with no clear preference, try using a mix throughout your piece (e.g. both "disabled people" and "people with disabilities"). \n Say "people with epilepsy" instead of "epileptics," "blind people" instead of "the blind," and "people with disabilities" or "disabled people" instead of "the disabled." Remember that people have disabilities. They are not the disability. \n Some people in the Autistic community are fine with being referred to as "Autistics," just as one might refer to "artists" or "blondes." This is an exception to the rule.Since autism is a spectrum disorder, to say that a person with autism is "on the spectrum" is also acceptable. \n "Tyrell is Blind") or to refer to a community (e.g., "Rainbows are a common motif in Autistic culture"). \n Disabilities that involve the last name of the person who discover them are usually capitalized (e.g. Down Syndrome). \n Some language has been turned into an insult or is used in dehumanizing ways. These words have adopted derogatory connotations and are best not to use.Instead, name the disability (e.g. "uses a wheelchair" or "has Tourette syndrome"). \n Midget/dwarf(some are okay with "dwarf," but generally "little person" is best)Invalid, lame \n Cripple(d)Defect, deformity, affliction \n Mongoloid \n Crazy, insane, maniac \n Spaz \n HandicappedRetard(ed) \n Idiot, moron, dumb, or any term that is considered an insult in popular culture \n A non-verbal woman who waves her arms about may be a self-sufficient, talented writer. An articulate man who "passes" for non-disabled may have serious trouble caring for himself and holding down a job.. Avoid judging people on how they look or labeling them as either full of unrestricted potential or severely disabled for life. All people with disabilities have both strengths and needs, and neither aspect should be overlooked. \n Don't assume that someone has an intellectual disability based on facial expression, motor skills, disability accent, or other disability symptoms. \n People with disabilities, notably in Autistic culture, have rejected restrictive labels like "high-functioning" and "low-functioning."Describe individual needs. For example, instead of "Hikaru is low-functioning," say "Hikaru is nonverbal and gets assistance with cooking, cleaning, and self care." \n Most people with disabilities are ordinary people; they get up every morning, eat cereal, travel to school or work, and pass through an ordinary day. Their disabilities do not make their life unlivable. Stick to factual language, such as "Ahmed has an anxiety disorder." Avoid terms such as... \n "Suffers from""Struggles with/is fighting"(unless the person says so themselves) \n "Confined/Bound to a wheelchair" (is also inaccurate; some wheelchair users can stand or walk short distances) \n "Victim of""Will never" \n "Stricken by" \n "Patient" (unless they actually are receiving treatment in a medical facility) \n If you refer to non-disabled people by last name, then refer to a disabled person by last name.If you refer to everyone by first name, then do the same for people with disabilities. This shows that you respect them as much as you do other people. \n For example, if you refer to Angela Ramirez as "Ramirez" and Ryan Black as "Black," then you would refer to Jimmy McCoy as "McCoy," not "Jimmy" or "Jim." \n If you refer to Angela Ramirez as "Angela" and Ryan Black as "Ryan," then "Jimmy" or "Jim" would be appropriate. \n It is acceptable by most communities to use both, but "Accessible" is preferred.New York in particular has replaced its universal handicap symbol with a redesigned "mobile" accessibility image., "Non-disabled people" or "people without disabilities" is an easy way to describe people who don't have disabilities. Avoid referring to such people as "normal," as this suggests that disabled people are abnormal. \n A common quip in the disability community is "Nothing about us without us is for us," and non-disabled people should not be the sole authorities on disabled people. Ask real people with disabilities for their thoughts and opinions, and whenever possible, ask a person how they prefer to be addressed. \n A good organization has many people with disabilities at all levels of membership, and elevates instead of suppresses their voices. \n A distorted form of pity, inspiration porn glorifies a disabled person for being able to do everyday things (e.g., "It's so incredible that she can walk around on the prosthetic legs she's been using for 15 years"). The purpose is to inspire people without disabilities, or to belittle their "excuses" for not doing something a disabled person can achieve. \n Living with a disability isn't automatically courageous, special, or superhuman. \n This implies that it is unusual for people with disabilities to have talents or skills, or that their abilities are inherently lesser (the assumption being that if a disabled person can do it, anyone can). \n Disabilities are often lifelong, and a disabled person will experience challenges throughout their lives. Individual problems can be overcome, but disability is usually for life. \n People cannot "recover" from lifelong disabilities; however, they can adapt and gain new skills. It is possible to be successful and disabled at the same time. \n Just like non-disabled people, disabled people have good days and bad days. Someone who uses a wheelchair one day might use a cane the next, and crutches after that. This does not mean they are faking it or "getting better," just that this particular day happens to be easier. \n Exhaustion, seizures, stress, lack of sleep, how hard they pushed themselves yesterday, recent flare-ups (e.g. a person with a blood disorder having a minor bleed), and many other things can play a role in how their disability manifests itself. \n People may or may not look different when they are having a hard day. Don't assume that they're feeling okay because they look fine, or that their disability equipment (e.g. crutches) is just for show. \n The spoon theory describes how many people with disabilities, from chronic pain to depression, need to budget their energy., People with disabilities can be good friends, sons, daughters, lovers, siblings, and spouses. Many are capable of working. All are worthwhile human beings. \n Befriending or falling in love with a disabled person isn't an act of charity. The person with a disability has something to contribute to the relationship. \n If a disabled child is murdered, treat it the same way you'd treat the murder of a non-disabled child. Don't focus on how "difficult" it was to live with the victim, or portray it as a mercy killing or understandable crime., One of the biggest ways to combat ableism is to use empathy. When you write about a given disability, imagine a person with that disability reading your piece. How would they feel about themselves? Would they feel respected or demeaned? Write in a way that shows disabled people that they are respected, they are valued, and they are not alone. \n When in doubt, look it up! There are plenty of writers with disabilities online who share their experiences. \n 
 It is easy for autistic people to become stressed or overwhelmed, so creating quiet places can help them stay calm. \n When they are looking for a place to sit, suggest one with minimal distractions (e.g. facing away from a noisy kitchen) \n Move conversations to quiet places \n Designate an area where the autistic person can retreat during stress, and fill it with calming things\n Autistic people may have a hard time with unexpected changes in day-to-day life. Routines can support their sense of stability. When changes are made to those routines, the whole day can be completely thrown off, leading to confusion, fear, anger, or a meltdown. Here are some tips to keep things stable:Help them create a schedule. Time slots can be used to designate what activities will happen during each part of the day. \n Maintain a visual calendar. Place it in a prominent and accessible location, such as a wall in the family room. \n Illustrations (clip art or drawings) can make the calendar look more friendly and appealing \n To prepare your loved one for this change, you should try to plan the event with them so they know it is comingFor example, a dentist's appointment may change your loved one's schedule. Put this event on your loved one’s calendar and discuss it with them ahead of time. While they might not be happy about her schedule being changed, they will at least be prepared. \n Try to place activities at specific time slots. For example, if they have math meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:00, plan something else at 3:00 (e.g. a family hike) so that they will always have some sort of activity at the time. \n After a busy day at school, a social event, an appointment, or an outing, an autistic person is likely to feel tired. Time spent doing quiet activities (reading, playing, special interests) will help them recharge and stay balanced. \n Remember that your idea of relaxation may not match their idea of relaxation. \n During a schedule change, try to schedule something positive after the stressful change. For example, after a doctor appointment, let your son have free time until supper. \n Autistic people often struggle with Sensory Processing Disorder, a neurological disorder in which sensory input that feels normal to other people may feel distracting, intensely uncomfortable, or even painful to the individual. Understand that these sensitivities cannot be ignored or willed away, and cause real distress. \n Communicate with your loved one about the stimuli. Notice what causes discomfort, or ask. They may potentially be able to express discomfort, or give you clues. Pinpoint what the issues are, and try to find ways around them. \n For example, if your teenage sister cannot handle the sharp taste of toothpaste, try helping her pick out a milder flavor (e.g. children's bubble gum) toothpaste at the store. \n Some autism therapies, particularly behavior modification like ABA, can lead to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder if they are done wrong.Some therapies are designed to break the patient's will, or force them to act "normal."This can be very emotionally damaging. \n Avoid experimental or compliance-based therapy. \n The autistic person should be able to say "no" and take breaks. \n Therapy should not involve crying, screaming, violence, or pleading for help. \n If you suspect that a therapy is overwhelming, frightening, or painful, stop it.If you are not an adult, tell an adult, or report it to the authorities. \n Exercise can provide an outlet for excess energy (if they constantly need to stim), can introduce them to sensory stimuli in a safe and controllable way, and can improve their mood and sense of security. Find an activity they like, and stick with it. \n Autistic people may do better in individual sports, or in non-competitive environments. Even taking regular walks can be good for your loved one. \n Special interests can offer a refuge to autistic people, develop important skills (for example, a young writer will learn to take critique), and possibly lead to a satisfying hobby or career. It also encourages the autistic person to be themselves. \n Choose toys related to the interest \n Discuss their interest for a comfortable time period, e.g. during a car ride (You can also model reciprocal conversation by asking questions) \n Help them learn more via library books \n Suggest that they join clubs and activities related to the interest, since socializing may be less threatening if they like the conversation topic \n Knowing your loved one's triggers can help you identify a potentially overwhelming situation, and defuse it before stress reaches the boiling point. Consider keeping a record of meltdown triggers to help future prevention. \n For example, going to a restaurant can be very chaotic for a child. Sometimes removing her from the environment for a few minutes is enough to help them stay relaxed. \n Meltdowns are the result of stress buildup in autistic people, and the best treatment is prevention. Here are ways to notice when a meltdown may be coming:Frustration \n Having too many verbal instructions given to them at one time. \n Witnessing injustice \n Painful/overwhelming stimuli \n Changes in routine \n Not being able to understand or communicate effectively \n Your loved one may not realize how badly stress is building up, or may be unable to communicate it. Remove any stressors, and ask what is bothering them. \n Take them outside for a break. \n Get them away from crowds or other stressors. \n Avoid placing demands on them. If other people are doing so, ask them to give the autistic person a break. \n Autistic people are used to being told that their needs are over-the-top or burdensome, so if they ask for something to change, it's probably causing them real pain or distress. \n Don't hold their needs hostage. Even if they don't use their words or say please properly, assume that it is urgent. You can coach them on proper delivery when they aren't on the verge of tears. \n Try bringing them outdoors, or leading them to their calming down corner. This will give them a chance to relax where they aren't surrounded by people and stimuli. \n Never shout at or blame them for a meltdown. They often feel deeply ashamed and embarrassed about losing control, and making them feel worse will only make it more difficult to calm down.Avoid crowds or staring people. Ask them to stop it, or get the autistic person somewhere less public. \n Stimming (aka self-stimulatory behavior) is a way to stimulate the senses, and it can be extremely calming for autistic people. Examples include rocking, hand flapping, jumping, and fidgeting. Here are some ways to encourage the autistic person to stim: \n Offer a rocking chair (if available) \n Bring their favorite stim toys and/or a weighted blanket. \n Ask about a stim that they like to use for self-calming (e.g. "Do you want to flap your arms?") \n Offer a bear hug \n Do not judge them for looking unusual, and if anyone else objects to the autistic person's self-calming efforts, use your words or a sharp stare to let them know that this is unacceptable \n Encourage an honest, constructive conversation. Focus on the triggers, and what they (and you!) could do to avoid similar situations in the future. \n If a crowded store sends your daughter into tears, try planning the trip when the store will be less crowded, bringing earplugs and stim toys, or letting her stay at home. \n If news of a violent attack triggered a meltdown in your brother, suggest to your parents that they not leave the news on at night, and help him with relaxation exercises. \n Autistic body language can be different from non-autistic body language, and autistic people may not always realize what an expression or gesture means.Don't expect eye contact. Autistic people often pay attention better when they don't have to look at people's eyes. \n Expect fidgeting and unusual movements. \n Learn your loved one's baseline, and what their unique body language means. \n Due to this confusion about body language, an autistic person will more than likely not produce body language that matches the way she is feeling. This is also the case with tone. Because of this, it is important to remind yourself not to read into or be offended by any rude tone or body language that is directed at you.For example, your loved one’s tone may seem short and rude, yet they may be in a fantastic mood. \n Watching their stims may offer cues. For example, if a boy only flaps his hands when he is happy, then this is probably a reliable sign that nothing is actually wrong. \n Even if they are upset, it may not be your fault. For example, a barking dog may have been putting them on edge all day. \n This means that while the autistic person is fully capable of understanding language, it may be hard for their brain to translate spoken words to their meanings as quickly as you can. Gauge their reaction to verbal instructions or long lists.They may need written instructions, or she may just require more processing time before responding. \n They may be unable to remember spoken lists, and need written and/or illustrated lists as well. \n Give them time to think and process. They may be slower to respond. \n They may be better at reading and writing than at handling spoken conversation. \n Your loved one may have a hard time communicating in busy places where there is a lot of noise. In places where multiple people are talking, your loved one may become stressed and overwhelmed. Instead, communicate with them in calm environments where little is going on. \n If a room is crowded, move elsewhere. \n Try using AAC if you cannot move (e.g. sign language, picture charts, or typing). \n Focus training is a training course the can help your loved one to develop strategies for interactions with other people. This type of training teaches individuals how to understand thoughts and feelings. Focus training is generally done in a group setting, though it can also be done in an individual session. During the therapy, your loved one will hopefully develop strategies for emotional regulation, conversational skills, problem solving, and friendship skills.Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) is a popular form. \n Not all social skills groups teach useful skills. For example, if your gay teen's social skills group focuses on heteronormativity, this is not helpful. \n According to the "Intense World" theory of autism, the world can quickly become frightening or overwhelming to autistic people, and they may need extra support in learning to handle it.These exercises may include: \n Practicing deep breathing \n Counting to feel calm \n Holding a favorite toy or item until she feels better \n Certain stims \n Yoga, meditation, or stretching \n Taking a break with music or singing \n Phrases such as "I need a break, please" or "May I go to my corner?" can be particularly useful. Avoiding meltdowns becomes easier once your loved one can identify their own triggers and ask for help in taking action. \n Reinforce this behavior by immediately honoring the request. \n If they are just learning how to do this, thank them for speaking up. "Thank you for letting me know that the loud noise hurt your ears! Now I can help you find earplugs, and you can wait outside with your brother while I check out." \n Fictional examples can help autistic people understand how others feel, and why they feel that way. It allows autistic people to analyze emotion from a safer distance. \n If the child does not understand basic expressions, try teaching them with flash cards.Ask "How do you think this character is feeling right now?" during books or movies. Offer suggestions if the person isn't sure. \n Also try social skills: "Do you think it was a good idea for her to do that? No? What would be a good idea?" \n Look for shows that are a mix of fun and education, such as My Little Pony. \n Recognize that your loved one is never going to be the life of the party, and that is all right. Focus on what they want to do: perhaps they want to make two close friends, or have someone to play with at recess. Tailor social skills to their desires, not just your own. \n Autistic children may be incredibly passionate about their interests, and thus may not always notice when they are monopolizing the conversation, or realize that their partner wants to change the subject. Teach your child how to: \n Ask questions to engage others ("How was work today, Mommy?") \n Tell whether someone is busy \n Gauge whether someone is interested \n Let the conversation shift organically \n Listen \n Know when monologuing is a good idea (e.g. when someone wants to learn about their subject of interest) \n Remember, the autistic person is constantly learning and growing, and you are one of their role models. Behave in the way that you want them to behave, and they will take after you. \n Genuinely listen to the autistic person, and ask questions. \n When frustrated or exhausted, act the way you would like the autistic person to act. Take a break if need be. (It's okay!) \n Demonstrate compassion. Never do something to an autistic person that you wouldn't do to a non-autistic person. \n Treat their feelings as meaningful and valid. \n Autistic people are at higher risk for anxiety and depression, which may mean lower self-esteem. Bolster their self-esteem by recognizing their good qualities, and praising their efforts to grow. Make it clear that you are proud of them. \n Praise can come in the form of kind words, hugs, time spent together, or extra free time. \n While praise is good, do not treat praise as an ultimate goal. If a person becomes dependent on praise, they may become a people-pleaser, and be unable to set boundaries. \n Autistic people need to learn how to stand up for themselves, assert their needs, and say "no" when they don't want something. This is especially important, since they are at a higher risk for being abused.Allow them to refuse things. ("I don't want that sweater. It hurts!") \n Praise them for expressing their needs. ("Thank you for letting me know the music is too loud. I'll turn it down right away.") \n Give them choices and encourage thinking. \n Avoid compliance therapies, which can hinder their ability to say no. \n When your loved one says "no," listen. What's wrong? If something is unavoidable, can you remove the part that makes it distasteful, or strike a bargain that they are happy with? Only ignore a "no" in important cases of health or safety. \n Teens and adults may gain skills through self-advocacy groups such as ASAN or the Autism Women's Network. (However, be careful about introducing them to such groups if they are sensitive, since the issues of hatred,abusive therapy,and torturemay disrupt their sleep.) \n Autism has a wide range of aspects that vary from person to person. Since autism is a developmental disability, communication and social skills tend to be a challenge. Specific symptoms vary.Autism is not a linear spectrum from "mild" to "severe." It impacts many different areas in different ways. For example, maybe your friend is funny and great at cheering people up, and has serious difficulty with self-care and sensory processing. An autistic person can be strong in one area and weak in another. \n It is important to understand your loved one's symptoms. Once you understand where the challenges lie, you can target those areas. Find out what strengths your loved one has, and what challenges they face. All of these components are important when choosing treatment options and coping mechanisms. \n It is good to know the general signs, and what autistic people think about autism. (Autistic-run organizations and blogs are usually good sources.) Here are a few signs of autism:Motor skills may be delayed \n Difficulty understanding and interacting with others \n Difficulty grasping abstract uses of language (e.g. sarcasm, metaphors) \n Special interests that are unusual in terms of focus and passion \n Over- or under-sensitivity to various stimuli (sounds, sights, smells, etc.) \n Difficulty with self care \n Repetitive behavior, notably stimming \n One autistic person might want to focus on developing the self-care skills to live on her own, while another might want to make friends. Others might be perfectly fine with living in assisted living, or not making more friends. Recognize that your idea of the ideal lifestyle might differ from their idea, and it's most important that they are able to be happy. \n Autistic people are not embarrassing, broken, or deficient—simply different. Instead of saying "I'll finally be happy when my loved one _____," practice being happy now, and embarking on your journey together. Demonstrate unconditional love, so they can love themselves. \n 
 Look for a power cord and a HDMI cable. If it doesn’t have a HDMI cable, you can use a color-coded RCA cable to connect the TV in the meantime. \n Opt to order an HDMI cable from an online retailer if you don’t have one, since they provide the best connection to your devices.\n It must reach between your TV console and the wall. Plug the power plug into your player. \n \n Don’t forget to insert the audio cable into your player and TV., Find the “input” button. Input indicates what device is being shown on your TV. \n For example, if you plugged the cable into the HDMI-2 port in the side of your TV, the input will be labeled “HDMI-2.” \n If you used an RCA cable, it is likely to say “Video-1.” \n Test all the inputs by pressing the input button until you have tried them all. Wait a few seconds between switching the input so that you can find the one that shows your Blu-ray player menu. \n Load it and allow it a few seconds to read the disk. \n Press the menu button to access the main menus. \n In the Blu-ray menu find an option to connect it to your wireless network. Once you type in your network name and password, you may be able to rent movies and stream them directly from your Blu-ray player. \n You can also connect it to your modem using an Ethernet cable. \n Find the setup button on your remote. Choose the 16:9 ratio. \n Press the setup button on your remote. Choose 1080 resolution if it is available on your TV, since that is the resolution of a standard Blu-ray.
 (Or, use your own sizes if you want a larger or smaller ornament.)\n Squeeze a few teaspoons of glue onto one piece of wax paper. \n Pinch two fingers together and run them down the string to remove any excess glue. \n Make sure the paper is flat. \n Lay the string across the first string so the two make an "X." \n Lay it across the first two strings so the three strings intersect in the center and are spaced evenly (like an asterisk). Reinforce the axis with a dab of glue, and press down firmly on it. \n You can tie a piece of thread around that loop later to hang the snowflake. Now, the three pieces of string should appear to be roughly the same length. \n Center it on top of the three strings and press firmly where it intersects the other strings. Add a dab of glue to each intersection. \n Pinch the circular string so it resembles a six-pointed star. \n Lay one piece on each of the six points of the snowflake so there is a three-pointed prong at the end of each point. Reinforce the axes with a dab of glue. \n Then shake off the extra glitter. \n When it is dry and hardened, gently peel it off the wax paper and remove any flakes of glue. \n Hang your snowflake with a piece of thread and enjoy! \n 
 Push any rubbish or undesirable material toward the pile, and move other material, brush, and obstacles away from the pile to be dealt with later.\n  You have three common choices for fence material, along with several more exotic ones, depending on your budget and needs. Here are examples: \n Chain link fencing. This is a durable material that will prevent rubbish from scattering, and is effective at keep larger animals like dogs, bears, coyotes, and others out of the pile. There are also vinyl strips that can be woven into the fabric to limit the view. \n Wood privacy type fencing. This is not quite as durable as chain link, and generally is more expensive and requires more labor, but it does create an attractive fence and will keep most animals out of the rubbish. \n Welded wire fabric fencing. This material is made with wires, welded together in a grid, for example, 2inch by 4inch, then galvanized. It is inexpensive but not very durable, and is less effective at keeping animals out, especially smaller rodents. \n Panel fencing, Rohn type fence, and even corrugated metal roof panels can also be used, each having their own advantages and disadvantages. \n Use the distance around the rubbish pile allowing for a buffer (clear area immediately inside the fence) to estimate the number of posts and the amount of fencing you will need. Since the fence run may not be straight from corner to corner ( it is very likely you may choose to circle the pile, depending on its shape), it may be difficult to get an exact length for the finished fence. \n Use a stout post here, since you may be stretching/pulling chainlink/wire mesh from it, and it will also have a gate hanging from it.  Dig your post hole to a suitable depth (30 inches is common, depending on how firm your ground is), set the post in the hole, and fill in around it, packing the dirt as you do so. \n  This distance may be shorter if the pile is small and you follow the circumference of it, so adjust as needed. \n About three or four posts from your gate, you will want to measure the distance so you have fairly equal spacing and the final post hits where it should for the gate to fit. Finish installing and packing your posts, and you will be ready to install the fencing material. \n Lift sections of wire up to each post, pulling it tight and attaching it as you go, until you reach the opposite gate post. Since we haven't specified what type post you are using, you will either be nailing the wire with fence staples or tying it with wires, but either way, make sure it is securely fastened. \n Now, nail fence boards to these, standing upright, and continuing around the rubbish pile. \n  Privacy fence will not require anything, but chainlink or wire fabric may require you add material, either vinyl slats or a plastic mesh fabric made for this purpose to hide the rubbish pile. \n
 If you are using whale ivory, make sure it was harvested before 1972, when the Marine Protection Act outlawed whaling in America. You can also use old ivory piano keys, bone or white acrylic., Insert a pin into the front and secure the pinhead inside the knife. \n If possible, attach a disk to a Dremel tool and apply the beeswax to the disc. Then, apply the beeswax evenly to the surface of the ivory, coating it completely. \n Why seal the ivory? Ivory is very porous. Sealing keeps the ink that’s tattooed into the ivory from spilling over into unwanted sections, leaving an inky cloud. When properly sealed, the ivory will absorb ink only into the grooves that you etch into it. \n Rub the wax cloth over and over against the ivory until it has a uniform surface. \n The ivory should look shiny but not feel very waxy. Set the beeswax cloth aside, since you will need it later. \n You will want a small detailed drawing to use as your scrimshaw design. \n Remember to leave one-half inch of space on all sides. A sketch-like image with good outlines and some shadowing is best for scrimshaw. \n Cut it out, so that you can align it with the edges easily. \n Wet a cloth with acetone nail remover. Rub it lightly over the top of the paper with the cloth and then with a bone folder. \n Make sure the paper is completely wet. \n You don’t want to move it around on the surface, or it will smudge your outline. Discard the paper. \n If the outline didn’t come off onto the bone clearly, you can sand it, wax it and start again., Begin applying pressure while holding the pin as vertical as possible. Etch the lines into the surface of the bone., Then, apply some ink to the surface with a cotton swab. Apply a generous amount, and then wipe it off the remaining surface with a lint-free rag. \n You can also stipple, by etching dots. The closer the dots are together, the darker the shading will be. \n If you want a line to be darker, etch it deeper and apply more ink. \n If you make a mistake, you can draw larger lines or you can sand the area, re-wax it and sketch it again. \n Wax the surface of the scrimshaw when you are done by spreading an even layer over the artwork. It should appear shiny and preserve your ink. \n 
 Type in “butterfly” and click on the “Images” tab to see a wide-variety of butterfly color combinations. \n You can also choose any colors you like and make a customized butterfly design., That will be the color of your costume. Common colors include brown, tan, black and blue., If it is for Halloween, you may want to find a sweat suit in the color of the body. If it is spring, opt for a pair of tights and a ballet leotard in matching colors., Buy one and a half yards (1.4m) of felt in the background color of your costume., You need 1⁄4 yard (0.2 m) (0.2m) of the largest accent color and eight by 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4cm) of two or three other colors., Flip the wing in the center, like it is a mirror image. Continue tracing your outline, without tracing a line in the middle. \n Repeat, tracing another symmetrical wing in the same color of felt. You will use these two pieces as the front and back of your wing. \n The foam will make the wings stiff when you wear them. Trace half of the wing, flip it over in the center and trace the other half, just as you did with the felt., Cut down the center of one piece of foam and one piece of felt. This is how you will turn the wings right side out after you are done sewing them., Trace them onto different colors of felt. Remember that you will need four sets of markings in the same colors, so that the butterfly wings look symmetrical., Pin the other set on the other piece of felt. Topstitch the markings to the felt wing with your sewing machine or a needle and thread., Pin them together at the edges., Make sure you use thread that matches your main felt color. Turn the wings inside out. \n Sew the center section together by hand or with a sewing machine. \n They will fit around your armpits. Each strap should be 9 to 15 inches (23 to 38cm) long, depending upon the size of the person wearing the wings., Curl them by wrapping them around your finger.,
 Most dorms have the laundry away from main living quarters, so you need to have everything together. Be sure to check that you've taken all your soiled clothes from your workout or sports bag as well as towels, sheets, pillowcases and duvet covers if necessary. This includes: \n Dirty laundry bag or basket \n Laundry detergent--do not use other soaps, such as dish soap, hand soap or body wash. These can cause severe over-sudsing, do not work well, and can cause severe skin irritation). \n Stain remover (optional) Softener or softening dryer sheets (store-bought or homemade) ). \n Cash or swipe card, as appropriate. \n Security card or key - even if your roommate says he or she will be around.\n Have quarters or small bills (if there is a change machine) or a pre-paid student card if needed. It usually costs about $2-$2.50 to wash and dry each load. It will typically take one load per week of dirty clothes but this will vary widely depending on your own needs., If you haven't done so already, do it now. If you don't have a stain remover, use a few drops of laundry soap on the stain and rub it in using the fabric around the stain.Only use a bleach pen on white clothing! \n A pen or lipstick tube can easily ruin all of your clothes. You also don't want your cell phone to go through the wash. \n Before leaving for the laundry room do NOT forget your room key. \n These can usually be identified by having the top or lid being raised, showing an empty washer. You can check machines that are not running. Do not remove another person's clothes unless there is really no other machines available. Remember to leave the lid raised for others after you are done. \n If someone else put bleach in the machine and didn't wash anything, your clothes could be ruined. If someone left soap in the dispenser--bonus!--unless you are sensitive to certain detergents. If there is bleach or soap remaining relocate to another washer. \n Sort your laundry into piles:"Lights" usually refers to white cottons or cotton blends, light colors like yellows and bright greens or anything that can be washed without damage in hot water. This will also include your towels and sheets (unless sheets are dark colored). \n "Darks" usually include dark colors that will fade after repeated washings or fabrics that should not (or do not have to) be washed in hot water. If in doubt, (like a red and white striped shirt) always choose a colder temperature. Blue jeans should be washed with the darks. \n Red and purple fabrics in particular have a nasty habit of releasing dye into the wash and turning white items pink. Put the reds, pinks, oranges, etc. in a separate load, or, if you only have reds, wash them in with the dark clothing. Some people report the same issues with lime or yellow-green clothing. \n "Delicates" include things that need special, delicate washing. This includes wool sweaters, bras, tights or nylons, silk shirts, swimsuits, and knits. The care label will usually indicate these items if you are unsure. Sometimes these can be combined with darks in a cool wash if the washer is not too loaded. \n The agitation in the washer will cause them to fade and/or become damaged over time. Also secure the drawstrings on items like hoodies, track pants and gym shorts so that they do not get pulled out during washing and drying. \n It is a warm soak and gentle agitation followed by a cold water rinse. \n Put a capful of detergent in the machine for a large load, or as directed by the detergent instructions and then close the lid to begin washing. \n Try to fill the machine about 3/4 of the way to the top. Allow room for clothes to agitate during the wash cycle. \n Distribute laundry weight evenly (if a top loading washer). A heavy blanket or coat may unbalance the washing drum. You may have to balance the load by with other items on the other side. Be careful of small, heavy items that may cause this problem. \n You will have between 35-45 minutes to just hang out and make sure no one takes your laundry out of the machine. Don't leave your laundry defenseless--thieves steal from laundry rooms routinely. Do your homework. \n Two laundry loads will usually equal one dryer load. Do not overfill as this will cause the drying to take much longer. It is better to use two dryers for 30-40 minutes than one for 90 minutes. \n Whites such as cotton T-shirts, sheets and towels will usually take a normal/high setting\n Darks will usually be on a medium setting. You can use a higher setting if you're washing lots of dark cottons. \n Fine washables should be either air-dried, line-dried, or dried on the lowest setting available. If in doubt, dry at a lower setting or air-dry if possible as shrinking of clothes usually happens in the dryer. \n Wipe off any lint present (it should come off easily) and throw it into the recycling bin. Return the lint trap back to its place. \n These give a fresher smell to your clothes and prevent static electricity between garments. \n Choose your settings for the dryer (heavy, normal, light) \n Get comfortable as you may have between 30-60 minutes to chill and wait for your clothes. Do more homework. \n This may mean either putting them on hangers or folding appropriately. Folding pants and shorts right away will reduce the bulk you will have to carry back up. If you fold jeans and slacks the way you would want them pressed (flat front or with a crease down the middle of the front) directly out of the dryer then they will likely not need to be ironed later (depending on the fabric composition). \n Make sure you didn't forget any socks, loose change, or other small items in the machine. \n Put them away and then bask in the glory of fresh clean laundry. \n 
 Look for an icon on the MLB.com siderail of games in progress that looks like a baseball diamond/baseball field. Revel in the beauty of what the screen looks like with all the good information it broadcasts to you. \n Each part has several other pieces of information it is broadcasting to you., This advertisement will more often portray baseball issues faced, though sometimes it will display events that MLB is a proud supporter of.\n Although the earphone icon (for Gameday Audio) and TV icon (Gameday Video) are always displayed, if you don't have these services, you can pay for them, otherwise, when you click them, they won't do anything. If you already have these services, you'll be able to listen or watch the game's radio or TV feeds utilizing additional web page data for these games. \n Sometimes, there will be additional links to change the date from one days games to another. This way seldom works, and will only be available for a limited time after the 11AM EDT cut-off thanks to MLB not refreshing these by 1PM and can sometimes be seen at that time. For most games at night, you won't see these buttons nor the date in this area of the screen. \n Due to the cost of these services changing from day-to-day, the cost to purchase these services will change and therefore not be described in this article. Click these icons to find out the purchase price for that particular service. \n The middle layer has three real parts - a left siderail, a center real-time image and a right siderail - with the left siderail being a text-based representation and information collection of the direct center's field-of-view area. \n Not only will the left-hand siderail ticker tell you who's at bat, but it will also tell you the pitcher and his current pitching details (including name, jersey number, his pitching hand, ERA data, and total pitches (which are subdivided into strikes and balls) the batter details (including the name, jersey number, his position, game At-bat to hit ratio, batting average, total amount of home runs and total RBI's to date) has to face. Also the left ticker is the current score and additional details of exact breakdown of how each pitch fared in relation to the balls and strikes issue and a breakdown of each pitcher-batter matchup along with any substitutions the feed may have encountered. \n Look for some of the additional details in the left siderail as to indicate what types of pitches are being thrown along with the speeds on these balls as they are being tracked on radar. Also, look for the result of the batting performance in this siderail. \n This siderail contains data such as the radar gun speed on the pitch, the type of pitch that MLB believes could have been thrown due to curvature of the ball portrayed in the center area, along with the markup of how the balls and strikes were thrown along with the resultant to the player workup. \n All pitches and information is tracked in almost realtime (with little delay after real pitch is thrown). \n Look for the details that display times when runs are scored. This is denoted by the words "in play. Runs scored" along with how many runs were scored in that play. \n On top of the center tile looking like that of what the player may see when they step up to the plate (with some iconic backgrounds at the back wall of the stadium), this center tile of the center layer also shows the approximate location the ball was thrown, along with where the batter is most comfortable hitting. \n The center of the middle layer of the screen provides a detailed look at the hitting location of the batter, along with his "hot zones" (where the player is good at batting). The hot-zones also show the approximate projected path of the thrown ball. \n The zones where the player is great at hitting is indicated in a red coloring. The zone the player tends to miss pitches is indicated in blue, and when the player has a 50-50 chance of hitting this zone is indicated in white. \n The background remains unclickable throughout the entire game. \n The background of a spring training game is generically made, since the MLB doesn't have these illustrations to show it's users. \n Read the results of each pitch thrown. Balls are denoted in green, strikes are denoted in red, and blue icons denote pitches thrown that resulted in a hit ball to somewhere that was on the playing field which is/was playable. \n Understand about the makeup of what shirts these players are shown to wear are made to represent. The shirts the players on the screen are wearing, are supposed to look identical to the ones the player is wearing in real-life. \n Look at what the player looks like. Along with the current jersey that look's like the current batter's jersey, you can also observe the side the player is currently batting from. For switch hitters though, this may not work too well, as the system isn't currently set up to monitor this situation very well and hasn't been fixed to show these batting position changes. \n You can also obtain other miscellaneous media about the game from either the "Plays", "Video", "Field" or "Feed" buttons above the boxscore. \n No longer is the field information shown to the viewer as a default option. You must access the "Field" tab here instead to see field dimensions for that particular stadium's playing field as well as which players are on which bases (players on the bases appear with a darker colored brown background) \n Look for the current box score along with the current lineup and stats for all players who have played a pivotal role in the lineup for both teams. If your current team is up to bat and you haven't yet touched the icons from the right side, you can switch between the two teams' lineups by clicking the appropriate team name icon button. \n Watch the pitching situation's stats below the batting stats under the team stats chart. This will tell you the order each pitcher's has pitched in, along with their pitching stats. (No, only pitching stats are displayed in that displayed box below. \n Look for additional pitch stats below the pitching information. These stats include ratios of pitches to strikes, along with groundouts to flyouts, total batters faced per pitcher, names of the umpires, weather at time of first pitch (temperature and weather conditions), wind speeds, time of first pitch (adjusted to locations time zone) and the name of the venue. \n Look for the names of each of the umpires listed below the "batters faced" line of this screen, if you scroll this siderail down enough with your mouse's scroll wheel. This is no separate scrollbar for these siderails and scrolling on the page's scrollbars won't help the situation any- but will make this situation a lot worse. \n The bottom has quite a lot of information for the viewer to understand the game. \n However, here, you also get an icon that designates the status of the Manager's challenge. The yellow dot indicates if the manager still has a challenge that they can utilize to help their team better win and challenge the calls on the field. \n The Manager's challenge icon is an almost new feature to professional baseball games. This new feature first began in the 2014 season, and can be changed, and there are so many ways these can be utilized, that these will not be provided here. The rules for this are written here for anyone to read, though this shouldn't be an everyday need when this page is needed to verify whether it was a contributable play that could be challenged. \n As each base fills up in color, these base indicates that there is someone on-base. \n This information is also given to you from the bottom of the screen. \n This area shows a short animated clip of what happened. Although it displays this animated clip, the clips are only text-based and can fly in and change quickly, but change back out prior to the game continuing. \n Look for Gameday Mini and Classic Gameday to be shown to you, if this Gameday View is too powerful for your computer, or is way too appealing to look at that you can't stand looking at it for too long. Look for the "Game Preview" either before the game or during the game to see what's about to happen in the game as the game takes center stage. Classic Gameday has a lot fewer features and is less pleasing to the eye than the current rendition of the PC app, but there are still some who still like the less pleasant taste to this day. \n The footer of the MLB.com site includes such links as the MLB.com Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Legal Notices and a Contact Us button which don't tend to have much to-do with the game itself unless someone has a question about the MLB in general or a feature about the Gameday screen that isn't/wasn't answered already. \n 
\n You need to hold the sieve about 15cm (6 inches) from the bowl to allow the flour to become aerated. Don't hold the sieve too high as you'll lose a fair bit of flour and make a mess. \n If you don't want to add any spice to the pastry, omit this step. If you're making this for your kids, only put in the spices if you know that they're okay with it. \n You can use butter but make sure you dice it and it's at room temperature. \n Ensure that everything is incorporated. You may need to use a spatula (or something else) to scrape down flour from the side of the bowl. \n This is to stop the pastry dough from sticking to the surface. \n You need to roll it out big enough so it can be lined in an 18cm (7inch) loose-based flan tin. Take note that the pastry will be fairly thin. \n If the dough isn't big enough, roll it out thinner. If there is too much dough, just cut off the excess dough using a plastic knife. \n This is to stop the pastry from puffing up. \n If you don't have any baking beans, some dry rice will do the job. \n Once done, set the tin aside and move onto making the filling. \n Set the cheese aside as you'll need it later. You might want to put the cheese in the fridge so it stays fresh and doesn't start to melt (if it's a hot day). \n At 10 minutes, check the vegetables and decide whether they are done or not. Your stove may determine the cooking time so watch it carefully. \n Make sure it's completely melted. \n You need to keep stirring to ensure that nothing becomes burnt. \n Stir so everything is completely combined before returning to the heat. \n Don't stop stirring otherwise something may burn. \n Add salt and pepper to taste. \n Watch carefully at the cheese. The tart will be ready when the cheese becomes golden and bubbles — take it out when this happens. \n Enjoy! \n 
\n Then, put it in the pressure cooker. Stir with intervals while doing these steps: \n Then, slice them into pieces. \n Then, grate it. \n Keep stirring with NO INTERVALS for one minute. Make sure you don't let the ginger stick and burn at the bottom. \n While stirring, squish the tomatoes with the wooden spoon. \n Then add one heaping teaspoon of red chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of haldi, and one pinch each of: methi (fenugreek), garam masala, and corriander powder to taste. \n After two minutes, lower the heat. \n When no more gas comes out, lift the lid up and carefully, get one of the onion pieces and try to squish it with an easy squish move, and if it squishes, continue with step 14. However, if it doesn't squish, then cook it until it is. \n Once you've peeled them, chop them in half. Then wash them all. \n And carry on step 15. \n When the gas has escaped, take the lid off. \n The picture above shows lots of the slices of the pepper, but you, have to only get 2 of them and chop them into little pieces. \n
 These animals are used to staying on the ground, so it is better to have a long terrarium than a tall one. \n You can ask a vet or pet shop owner if you're not sure what these are or where you can find them. \n You can also help maintain humidity levels by adding coconut husk, fern tree bark, or orchid bark in with your substrate mix. You can buy the moss at a local pet store. You shouldn't use the moss you find in your backyard as it contains parasites that are potentially dangerous to your frog. \n The reason the dish should be shallow is because these frogs can't swim very well. The dish needs to be big enough to have the frog's whole body in the dish with room to move around. \n You can buy a plastic log at a local pet store, but you can also make your own. Go and find a hollow log, soak it in water, cut it in half and take out the middle. Make sure the frog can fit under it and travel through it. It doesn't have to be wide enough or long enough to fill the whole tank. Also make certain that the log was never treated with chemicals of any kind. \n Heating is best supplied by an under tank heater as overhead incandescent bulbs can be too drying. Humidity should be kept at or near 80%–90%). \n This should be set to a 12 hour photoperiod. \n You may wish to choose to buy one of these from be beginning or start off with a 5 gallon (18.9 L). Since they rarely move, tanks larger than 15 gallons (56.8 L) will be unnecessary.\n The heat pad should be put at the bottom of the cage on the outside so when it is burrowing, the pacman doesn't burn itself. \n The reason for getting the background is, it makes the animal feel more enclosed and feel like it's in the natural environment if you get a background that looks like a rain forest. Another boost to the background is it makes the cage seem more visually appealing to the viewer. Always put the background on the outside of the cage. \n The substrate should be coco fiber or coco husk. These are also known as echo earth or bed a beast. You shouldn't use stones or moss because it may cause impaction that could kill your pacman and you wouldn't want that. This substrate is cheap but needs to be changed monthly and sprayed twice a day. \n The water dish should be big enough for your frog to fit in and move around and still have space. Make sure the dish is shallow because these animals are not very good swimmers and can drown. Make it shallow so your pacman can get in and out of the water dish easily. Dig and put it down into the substrate but make sure the substrate is staying out of the dish. Make sure the water dish doesn't take up too much space though. Remember that frogs don't drink like dogs, they absorb it through their permeable skin. \n The water has to be un chlorinated  or the chemicals in tap water can kill your frog. You can use tap water though if you have some water conditioner meant for reptiles, this water conditioner breaks down the chlorine and chloramines that can kill your frog. Water conditioner can be found at a local pet store. \n This hiding place helps the frog because the frog has a place to get out of the light if it wants to. It also lives in the tank. Know this is when most people make a mistake, they buy something that isn't big enough for the frog to fit in and just waste money. Another one of the mistakes people tend to do will be to go outside and find things to put in the tank as hiding places but you can only do that if you put the thing into boiling water and put it in the oven at three fifty for thirty minutes. \n These fake plants add effects to the cage and also creates more places for the pacman to hide and makes the cage look nicer. You shouldn't use real plants because they don't last that long and some are poisonous to the pacman and can cause your pacman to die. \n
 Biscuits need to cook quickly to puff up, allowing the outside to crisp while the inside stays soft, flaky and doughy. High heat will accomplish this with flying colors.\n The butter needs to be hard when it is cut into the four. This keeps it in hard layers that separate the flour, creating the flaky biscuit layers as the butter quickly melts, forming air pockets in the biscuit. This only happens with cold, near-frozen butter. \n If you don't have a pastry knife, a capital D-shaped tool with 4-5 thin wire blades, you can put your two best kitchen knives in the freezer as well. \n Grab your 2 cups flour, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 1 tablespoon baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt. and mix them together in a large mixing bowl. Use a fork, whisk, or mesh strainer to get any clumps out. \n Even consistency (no lumps) and well mixed dry ingredients will lead to better biscuits every time. \n Your goal is to cut the butter into small, thin chunks without heating it up too much. This coats all the butter in flour and creates air pockets. As such, you want to keep your hands away from it as much as possible, otherwise, you'll get dense, unenjoyable biscuits. The final mixture should have smaller, 1/2 cm cuts of butter and resemble a crumb topping on a pie. You have a few options, but should always work quickly to avoid extra heat: \n Pastry Knife: This tool has several thin wire blades, letting you easily cut the butter into small pieces quickly, with minimal friction. It is a D-shaped tool. \n Manual Cutting: Take your two sharpest knives and use them to make X-shaped cuts into the bottom of the bowl, sifting to get the butter near the blades and cut effectively. \n Food Processor: Go gently, on the lowest setting, stopping when you still have relatively large (1/2 - 1cm in width) chunks of butter. \n Start with a cup, but know that you may want to add a little more if the dough is sticky and hard to work with. Remember to work with cold buttermilk, not room temperature, to keep the butter from melting. \n No Buttermilk? No problem! Substitute 1 cup milk + 1 TB lemon juice or vinegar, or substitute a cup of plain, full-fat yogurt., You want to stir as gently, and as little, as possible. Use your fingers to start working in the flour at the edge of the well. Slowly incorporate more and more flour in with a gently scooping motion, pulling flour from the outside into the center. Never knead biscuit dough unless you want hard, dense cakes.When done, you want a shaggy, loose, and wet dough. It should be a bit sticky, and not fully formed. This is good. \n You will have to do some light pressing and mixing to get all the liquid in, but try to do as little work as possible to get a roughly consistent ball of dough. \n Sprinkle some flour on a large cutting board or other kitchen surface and plop the dough down. Pour any shaggy bits of dough on top of the dough before working. \n You can massage the dough from the edges out or use a rolling pin to evenly spread it out. Either way, take your time for the best biscuits. Physically working dough creates breaks down flour, creating rubbery strands of gluten that lead to denser, heavier breads. \n Sprinkle some flour on your hands or the rolling pin to prevent sticking. \n For now, don't worry about a perfectly even thickness. Just keep working it until it is close, then move on. \n Again, work slowly, methodically, and without excess force. Don't worry about getting it just perfect. \n If the dough is sticking to the surface, add a little flour and flip it over to work on the other side. \n More folds equal more flakes, but there is a limit -- too much folding can lead to you overworking the dough. Everyone has their own preferences and style, so the best thing to do is stick to 4-5 total folds the first time, testing the biscuits, and adjusting next time. \n When done, you should have a nice square of dough, roughly 1/2 inch thick. \n You can use a knife or a specialty cutter, but the floured rim of a drinking glass makes perfectly shaped biscuits every time. Note that, in general, smaller biscuits are easier to cook to perfection, since they take less time and retain their moist interior better. \n Don't twist the cutter as you pull it out of the dough. This seals up the edges of the biscuit, which need to be open to get air and steam inside., The first batch you cut out will always be best, but the "scrape" dough is still delicious. You could also try a few "drop" biscuits, which are shaggy, barely formed balls of dough that resemble scones more than their flat biscuit brethren., If you have parchment paper or a nonstick, oven-safe pan, this will do as well. How you place your biscuits, as well, will impact the final product: \n For higher, taller biscuits place the biscuits so that they are touching, preferably also touching the edges of a lipped pan or dish. Cast-iron pans work well. \n For wider, shorter biscuits separate the biscuits by 1-2 inches apiece., This can help them develop the wonderful golden brown sheen of the best biscuits. It also doesn't hurt the taste, giving them added richness. For truly decadent bakers, you can also drizzle a little sugar into the butter for a sweet kick. \n In a pinch, a light brush of water, milk, or a whipped egg will also help them cook with a crispy golden top., When done, the tops and sides should be golden brown. The sides will be yellow-white, and still a little soft. If you have an uneven cooking oven, or just want to be sure they cook well, quickly turn them once while cooking. \n Put them on the highest rack possible for the best, most golden-brown tops., Biscuits are meant, always, to be served hot, and they lose their wonder when they cool. Still, give them 2-3 minutes out the oven to finish cooking, let the steam build up the flakes inside, and prevent burnt tongues. \n
 It can taper downward, like a bowl, but it should not have anything that sticks out, like a handle. Objects that make great molds include: \n Cans, cups, and pillar candles \n Cubes and square candle votives \n Bowls \n Seashells (you will need to smooth the bottom out later)\n Make sure the sand is packed tightly into the container, and that the surface is smooth. You can use anything you want to hold the sand: a bucket, a plastic bin, etc. Whatever you use must be twice the height you want the final candle to be. \n The sand will stick to your candle, so make sure that you are happy with the grain, color, and texture. \n The sand should be damp enough so that it holds its shape when you squeeze in you hand. It should not be so wet that it is soupy. \n Press the object down until the top is level with the sand. You should only see the top of the object. For a shorter candle, press the object only part-way down into the sand. \n If you accidentally messed up any sand on the surface, smooth it down with your hand after you pull the object out. \n Don't press them all the way into the sand, or they won't stick the to candle. Make sure that the bottom of your object is the part that is sticking out, and the designed part is inside the sand. \n Leave these objects in the sand. When you pull the candle out, these items will be embedded inside the candle, and peek through the sand. \n Make sure that the wick is sticking up out of the hole. If it is too short, you won't be able to use your candle. Don't worry if it is too long; you will trim it down later, after the candle sets. \n The wick should be sandwiched between the two sticks. This will hold the wick straight up while you pour the wax., Fill a large saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water, and place it on a stove. Place a spouted melting pot inside the saucepan. You can buy spouted melting pots from the candle making section of an arts and crafts shop. If you can't find any, use a heat-safe, glass measuring cup instead. \n Use a candy or cooking thermometer to gauge the temperature. You can use wax flakes or wax cubes. How much wax you melt will depend on how big your mold is. Plan on having some extra wax handy for the second pour, however, as the wax will sink into the sand. \n Don't add any color or fragrance into the wax yet. The high temperature may change the color and ruin the scent. \n Never leave the melting wax unattended. \n If your wax has specific melting instructions, follow those instead. Some waxes have a lower melting and ignition point. \n Don't be alarmed if the wax starts to sink into the sand. You will add more wax later. \n Consider pouring the wax over the back of a spoon to prevent too much splattering. \n Keep your face away from the mold and wax; there may be some splattering. \n As the wax sets, it will sink into the sand. This is normal, and is what creates that sandy shell., Because you are using a lower temperature, you don't have to worry about the color or scent changing.Try using some ocean or tropical-themed scents, such as: \n Ocean breeze \n Coconut \n Orchid \n Pomegranate \n Again, keep your face away from the mold and wax, in case of any splattering. Because your mold is already filled with a wax shell, this second pouring of wax won't sink into the sand as much. \n If you pull the candle out too soon, the sand may not stick properly. \n Use a spoon to loosen the sand around the candle, then carefully lift the candle out. \n This will prevent the candle from making a mess on your table when you use it. Depending on how hot your wax was, you may have a subtle sand texture, or a thick shell of sand. \n You can do this with a small spoon. Try doing some organic designs, such as swirls and loops. \n If it is too long, it will become a fire hazard. \n If th candle wobbles too much, turn the candle over and look at the bottom. If you see any lumps or bumps, you will need to smooth them out using a knife. \n Always place a candle stand under your candle to catch any drips or melted wax.
 You can find them cheaply online. You'll need a few more tools, too, listed below.\n This is where we'll connect the step-up step-down module. \n Pull out the tiny wires inside. \n We only need the red and black wires in the cable. \n Be careful not to use too much pressure. The wires are very small; too much pressure and you'll cut the wire instead of stripping it. \n The end that goes into the PC/console gets screwed to the "IN" terminals and the other end for the headset gets screwed to the "OUT" terminals. Red wire for the positive and black wire for the negative. \n To do this, plug in the USB cable into your PC or console. You'll be using the USB ports on the PC or gaming console as your power source, but really you could even plug it into a phone charger and use that as your power source. This particular module can take any input of 3.5-28V and give an output of 1.25V-26V. Once it's plugged in you'll need to use our 1.4mm screwdriver to adjust the small screw on the module. Using your multimeter to read the voltage, turn the screw until the output of the module reads 3V. \n Pull out the wires. \n Strip the ends of the red and black wires. Set the cable aside for now. \n Be careful of the part with the speaker in it. It is only connected by two small wires that could pull out of their soldered joint. \n (Alternatively, you can drill a hole through the side to insert the cable through. Use a bit slightly larger than you USB cable. Use silicone, or more preferably, a hot glue gun to keep the wire in place.) \n There should be a speaker wire connected here. \n Make sure you solder it to the one with speaker wire as well. Keep in mind you aren't soldering these wires to either of the terminals that has the red wire connecting the positive and negative terminals. \n You've just turned your wireless headset into a wired headset! \n Just remember we aren't replacing any receiver, just the batteries, so don't throw it out! \n 
 If a creditor has forgiven or discharged a debt, then that creditor should send you a 1099-C tax form. This form reports the amount of the debt that was discharged. Receiving this form provides notice to you that the creditor has also reported that amount to the IRS., When you receive a 1099-C form, check it carefully. Make sure that the amount that is reported matches your records. If you believe the form is incorrect, contact the creditor who sent it to you. The creditor may need to make a correction and file an amendment with the IRS.If the creditor is continuing to try to collect from you, then the 1099-C form is premature. You need to contact the creditor to resolve this problem. In this situation, the creditor should either withdraw the 1099-C or give you a signed statement that makes clear that the debt is forgiven. \n Reporting the forgiven debt with a 1099-C form is the creditor’s responsibility. However, even if the creditor neglects to report the forgiven amount, it is still your responsibility to report the forgiven or discharged amount as income. It will not be a valid defense to say that you did not receive a 1099-C.Before reporting that the debt has been canceled, you must confirm the cancellation is valid. \n If you need to know the actual amount of the forgiven debt, you should contact the creditor directly to verify. \n Note that private individuals are not included in the definition of creditors who are required to provide 1099-C reports. Nevertheless, if an acquaintance of yours canceled a debt that you owed him or her, you will most likely not receive a 1099-C. You still need to report that canceled debt as income. \n Note that a 1099-C is only required for canceled debts of $600 or more. However, this does not mean that you don’t have to report something less. If a bank canceled a debt of $500, you would not receive a 1099-C, but the amount is probably still income. \n If the cancellation of a debt was intended to be a gift, then you do not have to report it as income. This definition of gift also includes an inheritance or bequest.There is no formal definition of "gift" for this purpose. If you owed a debt to your parents of, for example, $3,000, and when your birthday came around they gave you a card that said, "Consider your debt paid off," this would pretty clearly be a "gift." \n Calling a cancellation a "gift" does not always make it one. Suppose you owed money to your employer, and he or she said you did not have to repay it, and the employer subsequently sent you a 1099-C form for the amount. You cannot unilaterally declare this to be a gift. Under the circumstances, this looks more like a canceled business debt, which is taxable. \n Many employers treat any payments to an employee (or cancellation of a financial obligation) as compensation on a W-2. For this reason, you need to be sure you are not double reporting a payment as both compensation and forgiveness of debt. \n Some student loans can be forgiven in exchange for your working in a particular field after graduation, without creating reportable income. These loans must have been provided by your educational institution, a registered nonprofit organization, or by the government to be forgiven. The exception is that loans forgiven by an educational institution in exchange for services provided to that institution must be reported as income.For example, under the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program, educational loans may be forgiven to graduates who provide health care in areas where there is a shortage of trained healthcare professionals. This would not be reportable income. \n As another example, if you agree to do work or provide services for your college or university, and in exchange the college forgives a portion of your tuition loan, this is considered income and must be reported. \n Some payments for professional services, such as accounting for tax preparation, can be deductible. If your accountant forgives some of the debt you owe him, you may not have to report the forgiven debt if you would have deducted the amount anyway., Suppose you enter into an agreement to buy a home for $300,000, and you pay $200,000 up front. The seller agrees to let you pay the remaining $100,000 over time. Then (for whatever reason), the seller agrees to reduce the price of the house to $250,000. Your debt is reduced by $50,000, but in this case the reduced debt is not income. It is just considered a retroactive change to the price of the house., If you filed bankruptcy and received a discharge of debts, the total amount of the discharged debt is considered income. You must report it as part of your tax return, but you will not have to pay taxes on it.You will need to get IRS Form 982 and check the box on Line 1a. You will report the amount of the discharged debt on Line 2. Attached Form 982 when you submit your tax return. \n The term insolvent in this case means that the total amount of your assets (house, car, bank accounts, property, all added together) is less than the total amount of your debts (mortgage, car payments, school loans, credit card bills, etc.). Subtracting these two totals will tell you the amount of your insolvency.For example, if your total assets add up to $8,000, but you have debts of $15,000, then your insolvency is $7,000. For calculating insolvency, it does not matter if you are able to make your required monthly payments. \n You will need to get IRS Form 982 and check the box on Line 1b. On Line 2, report the amount of the canceled debt, or the amount of your insolvency, whichever is less. \n If you make more than half of your living from farming, and you received a canceled debt, you may be able to exclude this from taxable income. The formula for calculating the allowable exclusion is fairly technical, so you should consult with an accountant to see if this will apply.To report an exclusion for canceled farm debt, you need to get IRS Form 982 and check the box on Line 1c. On Line 2, report the amount of the qualified canceled farm debt. \n You may be allowed to exclude forgiven or canceled mortgage debts, if the mortgage was on property that you used as a business or as your principal residence, and the money from the loan was used to make improvements to the property. In this case, if the creditor canceled all or part of your mortgage loan, that amount is income that you can exclude.You will need to get IRS Form 982 and check the box on Line 1d if this was a business property. Check the box on Line 1e if it was for your residence. Report the allowable amount of the canceled debt exclusion on Line 2. \n Calculating the allowable exclusion in this category can be technical. You should speak with an accountant. \n After you have considered all of the previous categories of exceptions or exclusions, any canceled debt that still remains must be reported as income. \n When you complete your tax return, you will report the amount of the forgiven debt on Form 1040, Line 21. This is the space for “Other Income.” On the blank line, you should write in the phrase “Forgiven Debt” and then report the amount.This report will be the amount of forgiven debt that you have not already decided is either an exception or an exclusion. \n You will still report the forgiven debt income on line 21 as “Other Income.” On the blank line, you should write in the phrase “Forgiven Debt” and then report the amount., If the canceled debt was related to business operations, you will report it on Schedule C instead of at Line 21 of Form 1040. You will report the canceled debt income on Line 6 of Schedule C. File Schedule C along with your Form 1040 or 1040-NR. \n As long as the rental property is not used for farming, you will use Schedule E. Report the canceled debt on Line 3 of Schedule E. File Schedule E along with your Form 1040 or 1040-NR. \n If you are a farmer and the canceled debt is related to your farm operations, you will report it on Schedule F, line 8. File Schedule F along with your Form 1040 or 1040-NR. \n If the canceled debt is related to farming on a rental property, you will report the income on Form 4835, Line 6. \n You are not eligible to use the shortened Form 1040-EZ if you have any income that is other than W-2 wages or simple interest. If you have a forgiven debt, you will need to use Form 1040., If you use a commercially available computer program to complete your taxes, such as TurboTax, TaxAct, or TaxSlayer (there are others), the program should ask you if you have any 1099-C income to report. A good program will ask you for enough details to determine if the canceled debt is an exception, an exclusion, or is reportable income. The program will then generate the appropriate forms.If you believe that you may have taxable income from a canceled debt, but your tax software does not seem to ask about it, you should contact the customer support service for your software program. \n The official website of the Internal Revenue Service is https://www.irs.gov. That site has links to a wide variety of information and publications that can help you.You can enter “ITA” in the search box at irs.gov to access the Interactive Tax Assistant. This is an interactive tool that will answer a wide variety of tax questions. \n The TAS is described as “your voice at the IRS.” You can call this service to help resolve conflicts or to ask questions that you may have.Call 877-777-4778 to find out if TAS can help you and to find an advocate near you. \n Some qualified people may be able to have volunteers at VITA prepare their tax returns.

 \n \n Soak the rag and give the base a couple of good wipe downs until you don't see any more dirt, wax, etc. being lifted. ***WARNING!!!*** Base cleaner is VERY VERY VERY flammable stuff. DO NOT use anywhere near ANY type of open flame or ignition source. It is best to do all of this outdoors or in a very well ventilated area. Base cleaner will also damage plastic, so keep it away from any plastic, like your snowboard's sidewalls and bindings. Light cleaning such as removing sticker glue, etc., on the board’s top sheet will usually be okay and not cause any damage in my experience. \n from the base. Try NOT to dig all the way down to the wood core because that's an all together different repair that involves a different type of p-tex wax with an adhesive or using epoxy to repair the core damage before applying the p-tex. Re-wipe it down with acetone. Wait a good 10 minutes before proceeding to ensure there are no lingering base cleaner fumes. \n (Remember to watch your torch so nothing catches fire accidentally.) Hold your metal scraper under the candle's flame and continually scrape all of the black soot from the melting candle before applying it to the repair area. Now, contrary to what you may have been taught, instead of dripping the candle into the repair, it is better to "paint" the molten Ptex wax into the repair area using a paint brush, all the while striving for a BLUE flame, and again, continually scraping all the black soot from the burning candle before painting into the repair area. If you DO get black soot in the repair, you can usually just paint it out of the repair. Repeat until all your gouges are filled. Let board cool at least 20 minutes. \n Angle the scraper's bottom edge AWAY from you at about 45 degrees (with the top edge leaning back TOWARDS you) and PUSH it AWAY from you with even pressure, until the repaired areas are all flat. (You can PUSH or PULL the scraper, whichever works best for you, as long as it doesn't jitter, leaving "speed bumps" in your repaired area.) Don't worry about any minute scrapes made by the scraper. They are taken care of in the next step. \n But, if no tool is available, then hold your file against the side edge at a 90 degree angle (remember, the snowboard is still base up) and use long strokes with an even pressure (not too hard) and use the file from tip to tail(as always with a metal file). Now place the file on the base, across the edge, at a 45 degree angle, making sure the teeth are in the proper position to cut against the base's edge. Again, the key is to use even pressure with long strokes as opposed to short ones that will leave an uneven pattern on the edge. ***Also make SURE you clean the file every 2-3 strokes so no new base damage is created.*** \n created by filing. You may have to lightly dig out any filings left in the base to ready it for the second waxing. \n ***IMPORTANT*** Adjust the temperature until any wax wiped on it melts BUT DOES NOT SMOKE! \n Place the iron on the base and start spreading the wax evenly until the base is evenly coated with no dry spots. ***IMPORTANT*** DO NOT leave the iron in any one spot for over one second as the heat buildup will damage your board. When finished let the board cool for a good 30 minutes. \n This time scraping until no more wax shavings come off and the base is left with a flat surface and uniform shine. \n What this does is create microscopic channels that prevent water suction that will slow you down. It makes a huge difference, trust me. \n For detailed pics see the links below. \n

 Seek liberty for yourself and other people, or if you received life by a drawing, by chance, then would your life be expendable and probably lacking value?\n It’s not too late to dream big. \n Dreams can be started fresh -- or can be renovated. \n \n Whatever your calling in life, age or situation, there are unrealized possibilities that you can form from new dreams and plans to be lived-out. \n So, you can then appreciate your unique, personal value, and your fulfillment which centers upon finding opportunity for yourself and others to live fully by ones own plans based on a set of goals and ambitions. \n Avoid being expendable by being different, not droning on the same as others. That means work-out your dreams, and goals. \n \n Consider retiring later, if you wish, be productive longer; seek to compete and fulfill visions of personal self-fulfillment. \n It is not too late, example: Colonel Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), was 62 years of age when he sold his first KFC franchise (he had worked for over 30 in his own, small chicken place). He sold KFC for millions of dollars at age 74, AND lived to be 90! \n Break from family and friends ways, if they have failed to show you better ways and have even dragged your ideas down until now. You may have been discouraged from dreaming; or acting in your own upward mobility and expecting that for your family: some may be accused of acting like you are better than others of your people. \n Move-on, in upward mobility. If some resent the fact that you now want to move up or to do something significant with your life, so what. Or, maybe they were trying to protect you from pain or disappointment, but still you’ve been discouraged from living your dream. \n Choose your education and career to have upward mobility in the next generations of your family and cheer your neighbors to "live well in freedom." \n Support or oppose a political official, candidate or system. \n Live your life creatively, not formless, amorphous life, but unique. \n Write your own diary, avoid merely being a book-worm (like reading another person's diary): seek to be free in the domain of personal beliefs, ambitions, family, property, places and things. \n Do not depend on testing or opinions to reveal who you are, or what you can be, should be, or must be. Understand your abilities and aptitudes, but consider what actually interests you and worked into what fits your opportunities. Make it work. \n 
\n Rest the sole of the boot on your lap with the toe facing your other hand that is going to do the polishing. \n With your hand in the boot as such, you are free to move the boot around so that you do not touch the polished area with your hands, creating unnecessary fingerprints and smudges. \n Handle the boot so that the polished side will not be in your lap, but the sole of the boot (primarily the toe-tip sole) is in contact with your lap or knee most of the time. \n The cotton ball or cloth should be wet, but not dripping wet. \n \n Start at the toe of the boot, and work your way along the toe to the heel working on one side at a time and keeping below the lace-line. \n \n After application and drying the first heavy coat of polish fine amounts of polish need to be used to build up the shine. If you use too much polish, you'll dissolve the base you've built up instead of building on it. \n \n The shiniest part of your boot should be the toe from the laces forward, as this is the most visible and noticeable portion of your foot. The heel and sides doesn't have to be as shiny, as your stance and pant leg will hide most of it. \n
 You may experience pain while sitting or during sexual intercourse, or sometimes no pain at all, only swelling. If you suspect that you may have a Bartholin cyst, it is important to see your family doctor for a pelvic exam to confirm the diagnosis. \n In addition to a pelvic exam, your doctor will likely test for STIs (sexually transmitted infections). \n This is because, if you have an STI in conjunction with your Bartholin cyst, you are at higher risk of having your cyst become infected (and you will likely be given antibiotic treatment — more on this later). \n If you are over 40 years old, your cyst may also be biopsied to rule out the possibility of cancer of the female reproductive system.\n A Sitz bath is when you fill the bathtub with just enough water to cover your buttocks and vagina when you sit down in the water. The water does not need to be any deeper than that, although it can be, if you would like. (This depends on personal preference, and whether you are aiming to make the bath an enjoyable experience, or simply one of convenience.) \n You should have a Sitz bath at least 3 to 4 times per day. \n The purpose of regular Sitz baths is to keep the area around the Bartholin cyst clean, to reduce pain and/or discomfort in the area, and also to increase the chances of the cyst naturally draining itself. \n If your Bartholin cyst does not naturally drain itself and resolve with Sitz baths after several days, you may want to see your doctor to discuss the possibility of surgical drainage. The reason that it is important to discuss treatment options sooner rather than later is that, if the cyst does not resolve, it may become infected and form what is called an "abscess."This is more complicated to treat than a simple cyst, so it is best to be proactive. \n If you are under 40 and you the cyst is asymptomatic (no pain, fever, etc.), then often no medical intervention is necessary. \n If you notice signs of a fever alongside your Bartholin cyst, see your doctor for treatment. \n To prevent your cyst from becoming infected, use condoms during sex, particularly if you are unsure whether your partner has an STI; however, it is not necessary to refrain from sex., You can purchase over-the-counter pain medications at your local pharmacy or drugstore. Some common choices include: \n Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) 400 – 600 mg every four to six hours as needed. \n Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 500 mg every four to six hours as needed. \n You can see your family doctor, who may do it themselves (if they are experienced with the procedure). Alternatively, they may refer you on to another physician to have the procedure performed. \n Most cases of incision and drainage are outpatient procedures done in the doctor's office and only require local anesthetic. \n An incision (opening) will be made in your cyst, allowing any fluid inside to drain out. \n A catheter (tube) may be placed into the cyst for up to six weeks following the procedure. This is usually only done for cases of recurrent Bartholin cysts. \n The purpose of the catheter is to keep the cyst open, so that any further fluid that accumulates can drain out immediately. \n Keeping the cyst open prevents fluid buildup and, as such, allows the cyst to naturally heal. \n It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics, and to not miss taking any of the pills, as missing pills will lessen the effectiveness of the antibiotics. \n Also, if you test positive for any STIs, you will receive antibiotics whether or not your cyst is currently infected. \n The purpose to prevent an infection, as testing positive for STIs heightens your risk that your cyst may subsequently become infected. \n If your Bartholin cyst recurs, you can speak to your physician about a procedure called marsupialization. This is when the cyst is surgically drained, and then stitches are placed on either side of the cyst to hold it open following the procedure.This opening is permanent, and serves to prevent recurrences of the Bartholin cyst. \n You will likely have a catheter (tube) in for a few days following the surgical procedure; however, after that, the catheter can be removed because the stitches will be strong enough to keep the incision open. \n Both of these are simple procedures that do not require an overnight hospital stay. \n Doctors do recommend that you begin treatment — either home treatment or medical treatment — as quickly as possible once you notice a cyst developing. \n Again, this is to ensure that the area remains clean, and to maximize healing while minimizing the risk of infection. \n Sitz baths are advised beginning one to two days following the surgical procedure. \n For as long as the catheter remains in, it is key to refrain from sexual intercourse. \n Abstaining from sex for that time period will also help to prevent your cyst from becoming infected. \n After marsupialization, even though there is no catheter, you will be advised to refrain from sex for four weeks following the procedure to ensure full healing. \n Alternatively, if your pain is more severe, you may ask your doctor for prescription strength pain medications (narcotics) such as Morphine in the initial stages of recovery. \n 
 These are listed below in "Things You'll Need". Look for supplies in large box stores that stock craft items as well as craft shops and hobby stores. \n Children working on this project will require the help and supervision of an adult, as sharp scissors and an oven will be used. The aid of an adult may be needed for certain steps which require attention to small details. The time it takes to complete this project will include three minutes for baking and between 15 and 30 minutes for fusing.\n This is currently only available as a PDF file which you can find at http://www.2shared.com/document/T9COyD5v/bakugan_pendant_pattern2.html. The download link is near the bottom of the page (see image). Once you have the PDF file, print it out full-size on a regular piece of letter-size paper., First, tape the pattern down (printed side face-up) onto the surface of your workspace. Then, place a sheet of Shrinky Dinks plastic (frosted side up!) on top of the pattern, and tape it down at the edges as well. This will help to keep both pieces in place as you work., Notice that there are six different pendant patterns on the page, one for each attribute of Bakugan. You will only be tracing the outside line of this pattern for this step., Try to only fill in the space inside the lines; when the plastic is baked later, the painted areas will puff out slightly and fill out the design more. Allow the paint to dry before continuing on to the next step. \n If the marker is new, or isn't painting well, you will need to prime it; shake the marker up and down for a couple of minutes (you should eventually hear the agitator sliding back and forth inside the marker), then press the marker tip down onto a scrap piece of thick paper or cardboard so that the tip retracts into the marker. Paint will start to flow into the spongy tip. It will easily make a mess, so be careful when doing this step! \n Allow this to dry before going on to the next step., This piece will remain blank, and will be used later on during fusing as the bottom piece which seals the design is inside the pendant. Simply tracing the outer edge of an adjacent pattern to get this piece saves you from having to move and re-tape the plastic., Remember to cut only along the pencil lines that mark the outer edges of these pieces., Make sure to remove all of the pencil marks; they will not be included in the final piece. Also be sure to keep the pieces clean from eraser filings resulting from erasing., Preheat the oven to 325ºF (163ºC) and allow it to warm up as you prepare the cookie sheet. Take the parchment paper and cut a piece that covers the cookie sheet. Then, take the pendant pieces and lay them frosted side up on the paper as shown in the picture. Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, go on to the next step., As they bake, they will shrink (they are Shrinky Dinks after all) as well as become nine times thicker. \n It is important to watch them during this process as they run the danger of curling up and sticking to themselves, thus preventing them from flattening out properly. Grab a chair and sit where you can see the pieces as they draw up, and keep the pair of wooden skewers or chopsticks on hand to reach into the oven and pull the pieces apart if they start curling into themselves. (Children should have an adult do this.) \n Once the 3 minutes have passed, take the cookie sheet out of the oven and lay it on a heat-safe surface (or potholders) and allow the pieces to cool. Then, turn the oven temperature up to 450ºF (230ºC) and allow it to heat up. While you're waiting, work on the next step. \n This tiny piece of wire will be fused inside the pendant and will be used to hang it from a necklace chain. See the photos at right for how to bend the wire and cut off the excess with the jewelry pliers (you will need to bend the wire a bit at the non-loop end so that it cannot be easily yanked out of the pendant after fusing). The wire must not be so long that it extends past the silver "finial" into the clear part of the pendant, but also not so short that you can't get a lot of bends into it., Get the Pyrex dish and begin layering the pieces inside it. The blank piece is laid frosted side down on the glass first; the eye loop is then laid at one end of the blank piece, then the painted piece is laid frosted side down with the top end on top of the eye loop. A flat toothpick is placed under the exposed part of the eye loop to keep it from touching the glass., During this time, the top piece will melt into the bottom piece, turning them into a single piece. The frosted surfaces will flatten, causing the pendant to turn clear. \n Check the pendant after 15 minutes to see if the fusing has completed; it is likely that the silver-painted ends will still need a few more minutes to fuse. Once you are satisfied with the result, remove the dish from the oven and set it on a heat-safe surface. The dish must be cool to the touch before moving on to the next step! \n Grab the pendant near the middle with the thumb and index fingers of both hands, and gently wiggle it back and forth, gradually applying more pressure, until it comes loose from the dish. There may be some clear plastic left on the dish where the edges of the pendant touched the glass; this can be easily removed with a safety razor., Your pendant may end up with some sharp or jagged edges where it was touching the glass. Use the fine-grain sandpaper to dull these edges. Be careful not to scratch the smooth plastic on top of the pendant., Remember to open the ring by bending it sideways, instead of pulling it open., Simple enough. Afterwards, close the jump ring. Alternatively, you could close the jump ring first (bending it sideways until the ends meet), then undo the chain and slide it through the ring., Wear it to your next Bakugan tournament meet and impress your opponents.
\n Most junkets cover the cost of your lodging, but the credit card will be on file in case you go over your daily per diem. \n Then drop off your luggage in your room and proceed to that studio hospitality room. There you will receive your itinerary as well as your shuttle schedule to get you to and from the movie screening. \n Some events do not allow you to bring in phones that have cameras on them, so ask ahead of time if you think there may be an issue. \n You don't want to rack up a large Internet bill if only food and beverages are included in your daily per diem. \n Be able to ask them without looking at your notecards, and make sure that you have adopted a conversational tone if you are doing one-on-one interviews for television. \n You may be a part of a round table interview, a one-on-one or press conference-style setting. Regardless of the format, make sure that you are in sync with local time to ensure your promptness. \n Drinking a little bit to be sociable is acceptable, but overdoing it and embarrassing yourself or the publication or organization that you represent is not. \n You might even go one step further and look into the organizers' names and send handwritten notes praising their event to their superiors. \n 
 It appears the same, but you'll probably have less tell-tale nervous eyes. You might wear a hoodie/silly hat and shades; so they can't see your "tells" as easily, when you're playing weak or strong, but trying to look consistent.\n Do not bluff preflop too often. But, when you have been playing conservatively/tightly, and it seems like it is your turn to take down a pot -- it can seem real. Playing tight all the time is a form of tilting in their favor, so occasionally play your cards irrationally (for your own reason) and break out of the tight pattern (but don't ever say it's your turn, until you win). Bluffing is a big part of poker. \n Think it through before you say your bet, like what the consequences would be. Be consistent with the hand that you are representing by how you have played previously and think about what present hole cards connect on the board. Heads up, you have A♥J♣ and your opponent holds A♦Q♠ with a board of 2♣9♥7♦4♣,__, but you had raised preflop; so, your opponent would have put you in a range of high cards or a possibly a pair (but s/he has no reason to fear a flush or straight with the splits and rainbow board). Your opponent may call or raise your turn bet thinking that both the flop and turn would not make a hand with you probably holding high cards. You also, probably won't fold, naturally thinking, "ace high is good," not knowing that only another J or drawing a Q can make your hand worth anything. \n Heads up, you have 7♥4♥ and the board is Q♥9♣6♥A♦,__ you will usually not get the heart on the river to make that heart flush draw, and you would lose the showdown with your two low cards and three big cards on the board. Even a seven or four, on the river, might not be enough to win. So what -- well, when the ace came on the turn, would be the time to bet representing an ace with a flush draw (the turn and river are like drawing, but everyone gets the same draw) like A♥x♥ and if your opponent folds more than 3 out of 10 times, your turn bet might be a win (so, note the tendencies of opponents.) \n Don't fiddle with your necklace, tap your foot, or blink too much. It makes you seem guilty. \n Act like you learned your lesson to not bluff; so, do not do this often. By giving action/bluffing, and revealing a weak hand once, then when you get a great hand later, you will get bluffing action back to build the pot, if they think you are weak/bluffing again. This is different from when you bet in the big blind (first player past the button) with some trash hand, they accept that. You get a "free play" when your hand connects with the flop and afterward, then at the showdown your opponents see your trash hold cards. Always look at the position, in relation to the button, that you and your opponents have. \n The other players could be irritated and spurred on to tilt after this and, so, put more money in the pot than necessary, trying to tempt you to "Just try bluffing with trash again, buddy." But now you should only bet if you're strong, and fold until you have good cards, to take to a river showdown. However, if you hadn't shown those weak cards, just discarded them after everyone folded, you could still seem scary/more real, and could play more bluffs, by not having stirred up the opponents. \n In each case, you would have to be paying attention to your opponent's play in the hand and prior to the hand to get a read on his hand. \n With high cards there is a possibility of making a top pair with more cards to come on the turn and river, and it would be no shame to go to showdown with high cards without a made hand. \n Here, you are thinking beyond making the cut, and going for the final table. Trying this buying-in and paying to play each hand can be worthwhile because of the payout structure. Be ready for the rewards and consequences of losing, in this daring play. \n But otherwise, bluff against fewer opponent rather than many opponents. \n Use this when drawing, for example, but the pot odds are not sufficient. The bluff adds to the overall expectation, because some of the time without your holding good cards, your opponent will fold when you bluff. \n 
 You will need a double-sided (coarse and fine grit) synthetic sharpening stone. You will also need a honing steel, which is typically sold in the form of a lightly-grooved, magnetized iron rod. Both of these materials can be found at your local hardware store. \n Sharpening stones have two sides with different grits. The grit measures how rough the stone is, and thus how severely it sharpens. Higher numbers stand for finer grits meaning the lowest number is the roughest surface.\n The stone is porous, and it needs to fill with water so that the blade doesn't catch. This decreased friction and helps prevent scratches and nicks.You'll want to keep getting the stone wet as you work, so keep some water nearby. \n You can use a damp towel or a silicon baking sheet or hot pad. You do not want the stone moving as you sharpen, as this is the number one way to accidentally end up in the ER. \n Splash some water on top before beginning. You always start with the rougher side of the stone, with the lower grit rating. Many stones start at F 400 (European measurement) or J 1000 (Japanese measurement). \n Professional chefs may have multiple stones with many different grits to smoothly craft a point. More variety means you can get a better edge by slowly increasing the resistance. \n If you have a broken tip on the knife, fix this before sharpening. \n This can be hard to find, but just do it in pieces. Perpendicular to the stone (blade touching the stone, as if you were cutting), is 90-degrees. Now, angle the blade so that it is halfway between perpendicular and laying on the stone. This is 45-degrees. Now angle the stone to be roughly halfway between this angle and the stone -- you've got it! \n A steeper angle always leads to a more durable knife, but too steep and you will risk cracking the edge., This hand provides the control and keeps the edge down on the stone as you work., These fingers are your guides, keeping the knife down and moving it smoothly as you work. \n These fingers will naturally slide to help the area you're working on since most stones are not big enough to fit the whole knife. \n This motion should be smooth and fluid, almost like you were lightly slicing off an impossibly thin piece of the stone. \n Friction, when not controlled, is not your friend. Keep the stone wet to prevent accidental damage. \n It is often a good idea to wipe any grit off the blade each time your wet the stone again \n With your non-dominant hand, move up to the tip of the blade and focus on that. Then slide down and sharpen the meet of the blade before moving down to the hilt. Try to use the same number of movements for each section. \n Don't try and push the blade down into the stone. You want it to stay flush to the stone with every pass, but you don't want to be digging it in., You want both sides to be evenly sharpened, otherwise, the knife will be misaligned. The exact same strategy should be used as the first side. \n Feel the opposite side of the knife from the one you've been sharpening. If you feel a little burr or catch on the unsharpened side, it means it's time to flip., Make one pass on the right side, flip the knife, and make another on the left. Both the angle and motion are still consistent, as is the need to keep the stone wet. However, since the finer grit is making smaller, finer changes, you want to ensure that you evenly balance them by alternating sides. \n You only need very light pressure down on the knife with the fine grit stone. \n Keep the stone extra wet, and wipe the grit from the knife frequently with a damp towel. \n Take your sharpened knife and "slice" down the edge of a wooden cutting board, as if you were trying to cut into it. You only need to do it one -- but simply dragging the blade across the cutting board to clean off he cutting edge. \n The next step is to use your steel honing rod (sometimes known as a steeling rod), to make sure the blade is properly aligned. Make sure you use a few passes on each side, and keep honing the blade every time you use it. \n 
 Make sure that the baking rack is in the middle of the oven.\n This will allow the other ingredients to mix in more evenly later on. You can use a handheld mixer, a stand mixer, or a food processor fitted with whisks to do this. \n Beat everything together on a medium speed setting until the color and texture are even. This will take about 2 minutes.Make sure that you are using plain canned pumpkin, and not the pumpkin pie filling. \n Continue beating on a low speed setting for another minute or so.If you are using a handheld mixer, be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. If you are using a food processor, you may have to pause it every so often, and scrape any unblended mixture down the sides. \n For a more complex flavor, add ½ teaspoon of ground ginger and ¼ teaspoon of ground cloves., Lightly grease the bottom and sets of a jelly roll pan. Something that is 15 by 10 by 1-inch (38.1 by 25.4 by 2.54-centimeter) would be ideal. Next, pour the batter into the baking pan. Use a rubber spatula to help guide the mixture into the pan. If you get any residue in the bowl, use the spatula to scrape it into the pan. \n The pumpkin bars are ready when they turn golden brown on top, and a toothpick poked into the middle comes out clean. \n Do not remove them from the pan and do not cut them. They must be completely cool before you frost them. \n You can do this using a handheld mixer, a stand mixer, or a good processor fitted with whisks. Use a low speed setting, and keep mixing until everything turns smooth. \n For a twist, use 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of maple syrup instead of vanilla extract., Keep using a low speed setting, and beat the mixture well after each cup (125 grams) of sugar that you add. \n The icing should be soft and easy to spread. If it is too soft or too hard for you, however, you'll have to make some adjustments. Listed below are some tips and suggestions. After you make your additions, beat the icing well. Keep in mind that the icing will set up a little after you spread it. \n If the icing is too thin, add up to ½ cup (65 grams) of confectioners' sugar.If the icing is too thick, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of milk.For a richer frosting, use half-and-half instead.If the icing is too sweet, add ⅛ teaspoon of salt., Again, do not cut the bars just yet. Simply spread the icing over the top, going from edge to edge. When you are done, you can smooth the icing down further, or smack it with the spatula to great a nice texture. \n Your pumpkin bars are done at this point, but you can shake a sprinkle of cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice on top for more color and flavor.You can also scatter up to 1 cup (125 grams) of chopped walnuts on top instead., Once the bars are cut, you can take them out of the pan and serve them. Cover and store any left over pumpkin bars in the fridge, or the icing will get too soft., Measure out the confectioners' sugar, and put it into a large mixing bowl. Add ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon, and 1 pinch of each of the following: cloves, nutmeg, and ginger. Mix the ingredients briskly together until evenly combined. \n Sift the sugar first to break up any clumps. \n Stir everything briskly together using a whisk. Be sure to break up any clumps and to scrape the bottom and the sides of the bowl so that everything gets mixed. \n The glaze should be thin enough to pour over the top of your baked pumpkin bars, but not so thin that it is like water. If the glaze is too thick, add 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water.If the glaze is too thin, add more confectioners' sugar. Be sure to stir the glaze well after each addition. \n Do not take the bars out of the pan. Simply pour the glaze over the top in an even layer. \n If you have any leftovers, cover them with a sheet of plastic wrap, and store them in the fridge. \n

 You should be counting 1, 2, 3, 4 to the beat of the music and take one step after each beat. That means you should take a step to the right with your right foot on Count 1. This is the very first step to doing a grapevine to your right. \n /images/thumb/2/25/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-1-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-1-Version-5.jpg \n /images/thumb/2/25/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-1-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-1-Version-5.jpg \n \n That's why it's called the grapevine -- because you'll be "weaving" one foot behind the other. You can also put your arms into it, and pump them forward or upward slightly every time you take a step. In the "Electric Boogie" video, you can see that the dancers are really pumping their arms, almost as if they were doing the "Running Man" with them; it's up to you how much you want to get into it! \n /images/thumb/3/3b/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-2-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-2-Version-5.jpg \n /images/thumb/3/3b/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-2-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-2-Version-5.jpg \n This will uncross your feet. \n /images/thumb/3/39/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-3-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-3-Version-5.jpg \n /images/thumb/3/39/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-3-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-3-Version-5.jpg \n Simply tap the ground with your left foot without putting your weight on the foot. You'll be taking your next step with your left foot, so you should keep the weight on the right foot. You can also clap your hands whenever you tap your feet to add some flair to this dance move. \n /images/thumb/f/fe/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-4-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-4-Version-5.jpg \n /images/thumb/f/fe/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-4-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-4-Version-5.jpg \n Congratulations -- you have just completed a grapevine to the right! The grapevine consists of the moves set out in Steps 1-4. \n If you want to simplify this dance and aren't ready for the grapevine, instead of weaving one foot behind the other, you can instead simply step the right foot to the right, step your left foot to the right to meet your right foot, tap it, and repeat. So you would do a step-tap, step-tap, instead of the grapevine. If this is what you choose, then you should also do this move on the left side. \n You will now begin mirroring the steps laid out in Steps 1-4 on the left side. \n /images/thumb/d/d1/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-5-Version-5.jpg \n /images/thumb/d/d1/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-5-Version-5.jpg \n \n /images/thumb/c/c5/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-6-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-6-Version-5.jpg \n /images/thumb/c/c5/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-6-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-6-Version-5.jpg \n This will uncross your feet again. \n /images/thumb/0/00/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-7-Version-5.jpg \n /images/thumb/0/00/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-7-Version-5.jpg \n This time, tap the ground with your right foot while keeping your weight on the left foot. Great work! You have completed the grapevine on your left side. \n /images/thumb/5/54/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-8-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/5/54/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-8-Version-3.jpg \n This begins the process of taking three steps backward and tapping your feet. Just as you did before, count off 1, 2, 3, 4 to the music as you take your steps. \n /images/thumb/7/7e/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-9-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/7/7e/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-9-Version-3.jpg \n \n /images/thumb/5/52/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-10-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/5/52/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-10-Version-3.jpg \n \n /images/thumb/8/82/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-11-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/8/82/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-11-Version-3.jpg \n Remember to keep that weight on your right foot. To add some flair to your steps, you can add a knee-lift, kick, toe-point-and-hip-lift, or whatever you want with your left foot instead of just tapping your feet closed, as long as you keep your weight off the tapping foot. \n /images/thumb/4/46/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-12-Version-2.jpg \n /images/thumb/4/46/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-12-Version-2.jpg \n \n /images/thumb/c/cc/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-13-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-13-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/c/cc/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-13-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-13-Version-3.jpg \n Many people, instead of tapping with their foot, will kind of do a deep lunge with the left knee, touching (or just reaching for) the floor with their right hand. Others just tap their feet closed. \n /images/thumb/2/21/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-14-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-14-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/2/21/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-14-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-14-Version-3.jpg \n It's like rocking back and forward twice. \n /images/thumb/2/2e/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-15-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-15-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/2/2e/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-15-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-15-Version-3.jpg \n \n /images/thumb/e/ec/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-16-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-16-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/e/ec/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-16-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-16-Version-3.jpg \n Prepare to turn left, getting your hips and arms ready to do the "pivot and brush". \n /images/thumb/0/06/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-17-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-17-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/0/06/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-17-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-17-Version-3.jpg \n In the original choreography - this is actually a hop - and the turn happens in the air. The brush step was added later. \n This is known as a quarter turn. Turning to the left means that your left shoulder goes back and your right shoulder comes forward. You can kick your right foot up a bit and brush the ground as you transition to the new position; just kick whichever foot is in back to move to the new side, so that it is next to the left foot again. Many will also do a knee lift (with the right knee) and/or clap their hands here. \n /images/thumb/4/48/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-18-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-18-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/4/48/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-18-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-18-Version-3.jpg \n Start with the very first step. Note that you -- and hopefully the rest of the group -- will be facing a new direction each time you repeat, continuing to turn 90 degrees after every 18-step cycle. That's the beauty of the line dance -- once you can do it in one direction, all you have to do is to keep turning and repeating it until the music fades. \n /images/thumb/9/99/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-19-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-19-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/9/99/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-19-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-19-Version-3.jpg \n A "grapevine" is a series of sidesteps in one direction, stepping to the side, then crossing in front or behind with the other foot, then stepping to the side again. A more detailed breakdown is below. Count 1, 2, 3, 4 to the beat of the music and do the grapevine on the right. \n /images/thumb/c/c9/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-20-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-20-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/c/c9/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-20-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-20-Version-3.jpg \n This is just like the grapevine to the right, except it's to the left. Count 1, 2, 3, 4 to the beat of the music and do the grapevine to the left. \n /images/thumb/1/1e/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-21-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-21-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/1/1e/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-21-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-21-Version-3.jpg \n This part is conceptually similar to the grapevine steps, except going backwards instead of sideways. As before, count 1, 2, 3, 4 to the music as you step. \n /images/thumb/c/c3/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-22-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-22-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/c/c3/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-22-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-22-Version-3.jpg \n This is the fun little boogie-dip move that you will do to transition between turns. \n /images/thumb/e/e0/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-23-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-23-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/e/e0/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-23-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-23-Version-3.jpg \n Count 1, 2 to the beat of the music and repeat the process. Once you've finished, take another quarter turn and repeat until the music is over. \n /images/thumb/9/97/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-24-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-24-Version-3.jpg \n /images/thumb/9/97/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-24-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-24-Version-3.jpg \n 
 You can go to the fabric store to find a comfortable flannel, fleece, muslin, denim or cotton print; however, you can also use socks, old shirts, washcloth or towels. Whatever you choose to use, be sure that it contains no sparkly or metallic threads, wires, bead, etc, as these will catch fire when microwaved later on. \n A large, thick sock is the easiest cloth to use, since it is already round and you do not need to sew all the sides. You can also use an old hand towel and fold it in half lengthwise, for another easy option. \n If you choose a loose weave on your fabric, also find or buy a flannel or muslin cloth to use as your inner lining, so your filling does not leak out.\n If you do not want to measure, a length of about 20 inches (51 cm) width of 5 inches (13 cm) will work for most necks. \n If you want to use the wrap for other parts of your body, like your back, be sure to extend the wrap a few extra inches or cm to make the wrap more versatile. \n People use long grained white rice, flax seed, buckwheat, barley, oatmeal, feed corn, cherry pits, beans or millet seed. If you are making a rice neck wrap, make sure you do not use instant rice, which may cook when heated. \n Although this is not necessary, a relaxing scent can help to relax and remove tension from your body. Choose an essential oil or spice and mix it with your filling of choice in a large bowl. Let the filling sit with the scent for a day or so and stir often to make sure the scent is distributed throughout the grain. \n For example, you can use approximately 5 drops of an essential oil like lavender, peppermint or rose. You can also use 5 pinches of spices like cinnamon, cloves or rosemary. You can also mix with rose or other flower petals. \n If you are using a towel or a sock, this will not be necessary. If you plan to have an inner and outer fabric, cut rectangles out of both the lining and cover material, making the lining slightly smaller - about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm). \n Pin it in place across the open length and both ends so the seams stay together while you sew. \n Make sure your stitches are very close together so small grains of rice do not poke out of the seams. \n \n If you are sewing an inner and outer bag, leave 1 end all the way open on the outer bag. You will need to open the outer bag regularly while you heat the inner bag. \n Experiment with the amount. Most neck wraps are 1/2 to 3/4 full. Do not fill it all the way, as the less full it is, the more it will conform to your body. \n Although this 1 inch (2.54 cm) of the seam will face out, it is important to be able to rip this seam out and replace the grain if the bag loses its scent or gets wet. \n If you are making an outer bag, hem the 2 sides of the outer bag in and adhere Velcro to each side so that you can open and close it easily. \n If you do not feel it is warm enough, heat in 30 second intervals. Place around your neck and over your shoulders until the neck wrap cools, approximately 20 minutes. \n If you really want to get fancy, make the pillow, and then make a cover for it that can be easily washed, yet removed during the microwaving process. Just remember to make the cover measurements slightly larger in order to accommodate the inner pillow. This makes an excellent gift. Good Luck! \n 
 If you are new to string shapes, it can be tricky. The instructions will make more sense to a person who has gotten the hang of it. So, be prepared to start over a few times before it comes easily. It is recommended to try the simple Eiffel Tower before moving on to the elaborate one. Many of the directions in the elaborate method will make more sense if you have tried them out with the simple Eiffel Tower. \n You can use any type of string but it should be at least three feet long for children and at least four feet long for adults. \n It can be hard to scroll down if your hands are 'tied' and no one is around to help you. Before you start making your Eiffel Tower, position your cursor over the 'down' triangle on the scroll bar so you can move from step to step using your palms, pinkie, or elbow to bump the left mouse button. Or, make sure no element on the page is selected so you can bump the down arrow on your keyboard. \n If you are using a touch screen device, you should be able to use some part of your hand to scroll down. You might even try using your nose. \n Form a secure knot and then trim off any excess string coming off the ends.You should now have a complete loop of string. \n Begin the string figure by placing the string over both of your thumbs. With your palms facing each other, hook your pinkie fingers under the string so that the string is now looped over them as well. Pull the string tight, but not too tight., This loop should be made on the opposite string where it is going in front of your middle three fingers. Repeat this step with your other hand, taking your pointer finger and hooking the string from the middle of the opposite hand. \n Pull the string figure taut once again. \n Holding your hands vertically, from top to bottom you will see a downward pointing triangle, a diamond, and an upward pointing triangle. \n This position is called "open a." It is the starting position for many other string figures as well., Pull the string figure tight as you do it, so that you don't lose any other loops. \n There should be four strings running between your hands. \n Then hook them beneath the second string on your index fingers. \n Once you have dropped them, turn your hands so that your palms are facing up. \n Return your hands to the original position after you have done this, with your palms facing each other. \n You may need to use your teeth if you are new to string figures and your fingers aren't nimble enough for this move yet. Pull the string figure taut. You now are in the string figure called Cat's Whiskers. \n You should now have strings around your pinkies, index fingers and thumbs. \n This top loop should now be on both your right thumb and right index finger. \n Use the fingers on your left hand to expand and move this loop without dropping the strings they hold. This can be a bit difficult but just do it slowly and carefully. \n Repeat this step on the other hand. \n Be careful to leave the upper loop in place on your thumb. Again, people new to string figures may find using their teeth to be the easiest method for doing this. \n Repeat this step on the other hand as well. \n You should see a small triangle form on both of your hands between your right index fingers and thumbs. \n Just simply curve your index fingers and point them down through the holes. Don't pull them back up, just leave them pointing down. \n Rotate your hands 180 degrees around, moving so your thumbs move up. While doing this you will also need to simultaneously take your pinkies out of their loops. The flip of your hands should also release the second loop on your index fingers while keeping the loop you gained from the triangle. \n You now have Jacob's Ladder! \n This is the most difficult step of this method. Don't get discouraged if you mess it up a couple times. Simply keep practicing so that you can master this movement. \n Move the fingers of your top hand together and then pull the whole string figure tight.You should now see the Eiffel Tower before your very eyes! \n 
 Plaid comes in many different colors and styles. However, its crisscrossing lines mean it's almost always fairly attention-grabbing. This means pairing multiple pieces of plaid clothing with each other can be overwhelming or "busy" to look at. \n There's one exception to this rule. If you have one plaid accessory (like a scarf, purse, hat, pair of shades, etc.) that's designed to match your main plaid piece, you can usually get away with wearing both together.\n This is a great "go-to" style choice when you're trying to add plaid to your wardrobe. Solid colors offer simple contrast to the complicated interwoven patterns of plaid. On top of this, neutral tones are versatile in terms of which plaid patterns they can pair with. Not every plaid shirt will pair with bright yellow chinos, for instance, but most will pair with a simple pair of jeans or khakis quite nicely. \n Neutral colors include: White, black, khaki, muted blue denim, grey, and most browns and beiges., You don't always have to wear plaid with neutral tones. However, if you want to wear plaid with colored clothes, try to pick a plaid piece with one color that is close to the other color in your outfit. \n For example, if you're wearing a set of bright blue jeans, you might wear a plaid shirt that includes a few stripes that are a similar shade of blue. The colors don't have to match exactly — light blue can go with dark blue and so on., Today, clothing sellers offer plaid garments in a huge variety of colors and shades. This means that you have lots of freedom when it comes to assembling your outfit. As long as you're following the color-matching rules above, there aren't any strict rules here, but a few general suggestions are below. \n Brighter, more flowery shades tend to be best for casual events and warmer months. \n Darker, more muted shades tend to be more formal and more appropriate for colder weather. For example, you would probably not wear pink plaid to a job interview, but navy blue plaid might work well. \n Intricately-stitched patterns can give an upscale, intellectual vibe, especially when paired with a smart jacket and nice shoes. \n Simple, bright-colored plaids give a very rugged, blue-collar impression. For example, Paul Bunyan and other "traditional" lumberjacks are often depicted in bright red and black plaid shirts. \n Plaid is the name of the pattern (not the material) so you can find plaid items in a variety of materials. In general, you'll want to find something that's just right for the weather outside — not too hot, not too cold. A few seasonal suggestions are below: \n Spring: Light cotton or flannel shirts, umbrellas, stockings, hats, shoes. \n Summer: Light cotton shirts (tied around waist when hot), skirts, shorts, jumpers, tees. \n Autumn: Heavier flannel shirts, rain boots, trench coats, hats. \n Winter: Heavy flannel shirts, jackets, boots, scarves. \n Not all plaids are created equal. Though all plaids use the famous crisscross pattern, a huge variety of colors, styles, and sizes are available. A few pattern suggestions are listed below:Tartan: Large, old-fashioned looking pattern. Usually dark green background with navy blue, yellow, and red crisscrosses. Good for scarves, blankets. \n Tattersall: Small, tight, square patterns. Thin lines of color on a neutral background. Looks very clean and modern. Works well for semi-casual dress shirts. \n Madras: Wide, colorful striped pattern. Usually incorporates bright, "flowery" colors. Good for flowing garments like dresses or loose flannel shirts. \n Gingham: Two-color "checkerboard" pattern. Thick, regular stripes. Works well for a retro, folksy look. \n Your outfit is more than your top and bottom garments. Wearing plaid accessories is a great way to give a burst of color to outfits that are dying to look a little more vibrant. However, remember that it's not a good idea to wear more than one piece of plaid at once unless the pieces match exactly. \n Possible plaid accessories include: hats, scarves, stockings, socks, purses, backpacks, shades, neckties, bowties, handkerchiefs, and much more. \n Women's flannel shirts can offer a wide range of fashion possibilities depending on how they fit and how you wear them. Pick the style that gives the impression you want to broadcast to the world! See below:Loose plaid shirts tend to appear more "rugged" and casual. Try pairing one with a band T-shirt or an old tank top for a grungy sense of style. You can even wear men's shirts and let the tails hang below the waist for a "boyfriend" look. \n Fitted plaid shirts and blouses tend to appear more "put-together" and professional. These are great for a semi-casual look at the home or the office. \n Love your plaid shirt but can't figure out how to work it into your outfit? There's no rule that says you have to wear it as a shirt. Try tying it around your waist as a sash or belt to add a line of bright color to your outfit that attracts attention to your waist. \n As an alternative, you can tie your shirt in a loop and wear it diagonally across your chest or tie the sleeves around your neck like a sweater. \n This easy look is fantastic as an "anywhere" outfit. Pair it with a set of a clean (yet casual) shoes like flats for a touch of refinement or try sneakers for spunky style. \n You may want to keep jewelry and flashy accessories to a minimum with this outfit. These sorts of additions can clash with the casual aims of the rest of your clothes. \n It's also easy to use plaid to give the opposite impression. Try wearing a fitted plaid tunic or dress over a pair of dark leggings. Then, wrap a scarf or belt around your waist and add a few gold accessories, such as necklaces, bracelets, or earrings, for a touch of class. Finish it off with a pair of fashionable heeled boots. You'll have red carpet style on a fraction of the budget. \n No one's too old for this playful yet traditional outfit. Start by picking a plaid skirt with muted colors like navy glue, forest, green, or a neutral color. Then, pair it with a plain white button-down shirt for simple elegance. Wear a pair of black knee-high socks and throw on some simple black flats to complete the look. \n Women have tons of awesome options when it comes to plaid accessories. Look for a plaid handbag, scarf, or belt at your favorite outlet. Then, for maximum impact, add the accessory to a simple plaid-free outfit that only uses solid prints like to a white t-shirt and jeans. The contrast between the accessory and the rest of your clothes will naturally make it an eye-catcher. \n Some famous labels, like Burberry, offer iconic plaid patterns on their accessories. These are great, but you don't have to spend lots of money to get this look. The visual contrast is what's important, not the price tag. \n When it comes to plaid fashion for men, the idea of "ruggedness" is a popular one. To get this rugged, masculine look, pick a long-sleeved flannel shirt in traditional colors, like red and black or gray and black. Wear it with your most comfortable jeans and a pair of hiking boots. That's all you need! \n White or black tees are the perfect undershirts for this no-frills outfit. You can even try showing off a hairy chest by wearing a tank top — if you're going for the lumberjack look, you might as well flaunt it! \n Brighter plaids aren't just for women. Bright plaid flannels go good with a tee shirt and jeans or shorts for a casual beach-bum look. Alternatively, pair a bright plaid dress shirt with a pair of khakis or grey dress pants for a bold, semi-formal outfit. \n Depending on their fit, a pair of plaid shorts can have a wide range of effects. Try picking either a baggy or fitted pair of shorts depending on the situation. See below: \n Baggy plaid shorts usually give a more casual, relaxed impression. Pair with a fitted tee or a solid dress shirt for best results. \n Fitted plaid shorts usually give a slightly classier impression. They're still more casual than pants, but they're more connected to "upper-crust" sports activities like golf. Try pairing with a solid-color polo. \n Sometimes a small amount of tie in the right place can make a big impression. If you only want a subtle hint of plaid in your outfit, put on a plaid print tie the next time you wear a suit. The pattern will liven up your style without looking too tacky or overdone. Both neck ties and bow ties work well. However, plaid ties aren't usually appropriate for especially formal events. \n Be sure to use a subdued, solid-color shirt under the tie. Patterned shirts can make your upper body look very "busy" when paired with a complicated plaid tie. \n Using plaid patterns for suits is do-able, but only if the plaid pattern is a subtle one. Suits that are bold about their plaid patterns are a relic of the 1970s. They can be visually distracting at best and can make you look like a game show host at worst. Pick plaid suits with very thin, subtle stitching and neutral colors to play things safe. \n As a general rule, if a plaid suit looks like a solid color suit until you get close to it, it's probably safe. \n This is worth repeating. One of the very worst things you can do with plaid is to wear lots of it. The best plaid outfits generally have one prominent plaid item. Outfits that do use multiple plaid items generally have them matching exactly and use neutral tones to keep the plaid from overwhelming the outfit, but even this is a difficult feat to pull off. \n Pairing two different kinds of plaid in the same outfit is almost always a bad idea. With the complex, interlocking patterns of the plaid and the many colors involved, it's almost impossible to get the two items to match. Even if you do, the effect can be overwhelming. \n Though it isn't always outright informal, plaid isn't usually considered especially dignified. There are usually much better choices for dressing respectfully. Unless you've been given special dress code instructions, it's better to stick to a suit, tuxedo, dress, or gown for events like weddings, funerals, and so on. \n A good rule of thumb is this: if the event is something you feel like you need to wear a suit or dress for, don't wear plaid (even if it's part of your suit or dress). \n For the same reason that it's a bad idea to wear multiple different kinds of plaid, you won't usually want to wear plaid along with bright colors (either prints or solid colors). For instance, pairing plaid with neon-colored fabric is sure to make your outfit an over-complicated eyesore. Remember: neutral tones are your friends when it comes to plaid. \n One of the best things about plaid is that it's easy to get great-looking plaid prints for cheap at thrift stores. Plaid gets a somewhat appealing "weathered" look as it ages. This makes a plaid shirt that was once intended as semi-formal wear or work clothing, for instance, perfect for a "grungy" ensemble in a few decades' time. Save money on your next shopping trip by visiting a second hand store and digging around for these sorts of plaid bargains. \n For reasons that are difficult to define, bold plaid pants often look bizarre and distracting even when a shirt of the same print would not. While haute couture fashion models may be able to pull off plaid pants, 99% of the world's population can't, so you'll probably want to steer clear. \n 
\n Unless you are self-employed, it may be easier to use your take-home pay instead of your gross income. \n You may want to set up broad categories, such as housing, food, and debt repayment, and then set up sub-categories within them, such as mortgage or rent, utilities, and repairs under the housing category. \n Name it "Budget" or something similar. \n \n Under the word "Income," list all your sources of income for each month, including your paycheck, your spouse's paycheck, any bonuses or commissions you receive, interest or dividends, and any other sources of income. \n Under the list of income, type the words "Total Income." \n The # sign represents the first row of income, and #2 represents the final row of income. "B" is the column you are totaling. It should be for January. \n The formula will automatically add up your income for each month. Instead of "letter," type the corresponding letter of the column (C, D, E, etc.). \n Type this next to the column for December. Type the =sum formula into each box in that column to total your entire income for the year. \n For example, type the word "Housing" in the row under "Expenses" in column A. \n Include items such as repairs, the cost or rent of your mortgage, utilities, telephone and Internet service, furnishings, and landscaping. \n The formula will calculate how much you've spent for housing during each month. \n \n You'll be able to compare your spending with what you would like to spend by looking at the "Total" number compared to the "Estimated." Adjust the "Estimated" number as needed. \n Use the =sum formula to total the amount of each category and compare it to your estimated amounts. \n In the next column over, type =sum(B#:B#2), where # is the first row number of the list of expenses and #2 is the final row number of the list of expenses. Repeat in the remaining columns. \n In column B, type =sum(B#-B#2), where # is the row number of your total income and #2 is the row number of "Total Expenses." \n The formula will subtract your expenses from your income and allow you to see whether you've spent more than you've earned. Repeat with the remaining columns. \n 
 Although constipation and nausea tend to be the two greatest concerns, other side effects to be aware of include: \n Drowsiness and reduced focus and mental alertness \n Respiratory depression (a decreased drive to breathe due to the effect that opioids can have on the brain; this can be lead to death if the patient overdoses on his opioid medication) \n Itchiness \n Decreased libido and difficulty with orgasm \n The possibility of becoming addicted to the medication \n Trying an antihistamine medication such as Benadryl can help to alleviate the itch, but it can have a sedating effect. You may also want to try cetirizine, which is usually used in for chronic itchiness and has less sedating effects. Speak to your doctor about this if itchiness is a problem for you. \n Doctors tend not to use stimulant medications to combat opioid-induced drowsiness, except in palliative (end of life) situations. The general approach is to see if the drowsiness subsides as your body gets used to the opioid medication and, if not, to reduce the dose. \n Note that this is another reason that your doctor will start you on a low dose of opioid medication, and gradually increase the dose as needed. This gives your body time to slowly adapt to the medication, as many of the opioid side effects decrease with time as your body gets used to it. \n Doctors also start with a low dose of opioid in order to prevent respiratory depression. They will monitor you at a low dose and ensure that your breathing is not negatively affected before increasing the dose, in order to ensure that you are not at risk of respiratory complications. \n There are many different opioid medications available, so switching to another one (and rotating which one you take) can help to decrease the side effects you are suffering from. Your doctor can also vary the route of administration of the medication, such as switching it from an oral pill to a transdermal skin patch; varying the route of administration can also help to diminish side effects. \n Dose reduction or switching opioids may be enough to reduce the problem; if not, your doctor or a sex therapist may be able to help you in other ways to reclaim your sex life. \n The greatest risk factors for developing a dependency on opioid drugs is having a personal history of addiction or a family history of addictive behaviors. \n Speak to your doctor about the possibility of addiction or drug dependency if this is a concern for you. \n Know that everyone develops "tolerance" to opioid medications, meaning that the effectiveness of the drug gradually reduces with time as your body gets used to it. \n However, developing tolerance with time is not the same as developing an addiction. \n Addiction is when your ability to regulate your own behavior with regards to obtaining higher doses of the drug gets out of control. \n Do not use opioids chronically. Use pain pills only for short periods to control pain or relieve discomfort and use them as directed by your doctor. \n If you do become addicted to opioid pills, reach out to a loved one, friend, or doctor. This intervention may get you the help that you need to recover from using these powerful drugs. \n 
 This update installs the Home app, which you’ll use to control your HomeKit accessories.\n Check electronics stores for products (e.g., security systems, lighting, smart locks, etc.) that say “Works with Apple HomeKit” on their packaging.See http://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all-accessories/homekit for a list of HomeKit accessories you can buy directly from Apple. \n This is how the Home app organizes your rooms and accessories: \n Home: This is the highest level in the app. Each home contains rooms, which contain accessories. \n Rooms: Your home will have at least one room. For example, you may add a room called Kitchen to your home. \n Accessories: These are the HomeKit-enabled products in each room, such as smart lights and thermostats. You may have accessories in the Kitchen and Office rooms in your home. \n Every accessory is different, so you must follow its specific steps to prepare it for pairing with Home., In a few moments, you must snap a photo of this code to pair the accessory with Home. This 8-digit code follows the format 123-45-678 and can be found on the accessory or its packaging.\n If this is your first time setting up Home, the “My Home” screen will appear. \n If you’ve already set up a home and a room in the app, tap Home and select the room where the accessory is connected. \n Home will now scan for compatible accessories and display the results as square tiles.If you’re adding a new accessory to an existing room, tap +. \n The camera frame will appear., Home will snap the photo and pair with the device.If you’re unable to capture the code, tap Enter code manually to enter it with the keypad. \n This is helpful if you plan to use Siri to control devices.For example, if your overhead light appears as “Philips 24E633,” tap that and change it to “overhead light.” \n \n There are some room names set up by default (e.g., Living Room, Bedroom). Tap one of those options to add your accessory to that room. \n Tap Create New if you want to create a room with a new name. \n It’s at the top right corner of the screen. The accessory is now paired with the Home app.Some accessories need additional setup steps. Refer to its manual to make sure there’s nothing else you need to do. \n A “scene” will let you control multiple accessories at the same time with a single tap. You’ll be able to select which accessories are included in the scene, as well as what happens when the scene is activated.For example, you could create a scene that will dim the lights, lock the door, and turn down the thermostat when you leave the house. \n Tap one of the four suggestions (Arrive Home, Good Morning, Good Night, Leave Home) or click Custom to start from scratch. \n The suggested scenes try to build a useful scene for you. For example, the Good Morning scene will automatically include the option to turn off compatible porch light. \n You’ll see a list of all accessories added to the scene., This is where you’ll set what happens to this accessory when the scene is active. For example:If you’re editing the Arrive Home scene, tap and hold the porch light and switch it to On. \n You may also disarm the security system and start warming the oven. \n This gives your scene a test run so you can see it in action., This makes it so you can quickly turn the scene on and off from the Home tab and Control Center., If you only have one, you should already be on this screen., Now you’ll see the accessories in this room as square tiles. \n The tiles will also display the accessory’s current status, such as whether it’s on or off. \n A thermostat should display the current temperature setting. \n A light may report its brightness level as a percentage (e.g. 75%). \n On some devices, you’ll see extra features on this screen. If not, leave it open and skip to the next step. Here are some extra features you may see: A temperature control panel for a thermostat. \n A slider that controls lighting brightness. \n A volume slider for a speaker system. \n Now you’re back at the Room tab., If you created a scene (one action for many accessories) that includes accessories in this room, you’ll see it under scenes., From the home screen of your iPhone or iPad:Tap the Settings app. \n Tap Siri. \n Make sure the switch is in the On position. \n Here are some examples:“Set the brightness of the bedroom light to 35%” \n “Set the temperature to 67 degrees.” \n “Turn on the porch light at the beach house.” \n If you’re using a scene like Leave Home or Good Morning, you could say “I’m leaving” or “good morning” to activate the scene. \n You can use the iOS Control Center to quickly manage any accessories you’ve saved as Favorites.See Customizing an Accessory to learn how to add accessories to your Favorites. \n The main screen of the Control Center will appear., The Home controls are on the last screen of the Control Center. You’ll see a house icon at the top and your favorite accessories as tiles below.The tiles also report some information about each accessory, such as whether it’s turned on or off. \n Like controlling accessories with the Home app, long-pressing a tile will bring up extra features for certain accessories. \n For example, rather than tapping a light to turn it off, tap and hold it to reach the on-screen dimmer, then drag the dimmer to the desired position. \n If you added a scene to your favorites in the Home app, it will appear on this screen., You can edit an accessory’s settings, such as its name, icon, and group settings, at any time., If you only have one Home, you’ll be there already., Enter a name that describes the accessory (e.g., overhead lighting, Bob’s speakers)., If you want to move the accessory to a different room, you can select the new room here. \n You can also tap Create New to set up a brand new room. \n This adds a tile for this accessory to the Home tab and the Control Center., You can add a new room to your home at any time., It’s the center icon at the bottom of the screen., It’s the round icon at the top left corner., The room will now appear in your home.
 An easy place to start is with lighting. This can be easily achieved by simply changing out your normal light bulbs for coloured ones. Green and Red seem to be the colours that work the best, blue looks a bit washed out. Black or Purple bulbs are also great for spooky effects. You can buy any of these from many supermarkets. Place some of them in the main room and some in table lamps. You’ll be amazed at the difference it creates.\n Let’s face it nobody ever really imagines Halloween being set in modern times! \n What’s left can be transformed by throwing over a white sheet, dust covers like you observe in all the movies. \n Check out this Refrigerator Door Cover. With this on your Bathroom Door your guests will never have to ask for directions. \n then you can either get a can of spray glue and spray the objects followed by sprinkling the dust over (you can get this from your vacuum cleaner) or you can buy textured spray which if used heavily creates a sandstone like gritty finish but if used sparingly will look almost like dust.By selecting the vacuum cleaner option means that with a quick wash you can use all the dishes again. Anyway sprinkle the dust over the dining sets and the tablecloth. \n Green Bottles look the best as the wax shows up better against the green glass. Make sure you let a good amount of wax flow down the bottles or holders, the wax looks really great and helps to set the scene in action. \n I’ll let you be the judge of horrors you think your children and guests can handle. \n \n Its time to get one of dad’s old suits and stuff it with straw or old clothes. \n Make a round head shape with a balloon or ball (anything will do to as long as its head shaped). \n You could get a Halloween mask for the face and use a party wig or a hat for the head. You can make your guest as gruesome as you want. \n Tear up the clothes make them look old and worn with a bit gray and bit of blood and slim doesn’t go amiss. \n Pop them on one of the chairs at your dining table and you have a zombie dining guest, create more and have a whole party of dining zombies. \n Some of their food could be a real eye opener too, but that’s for later... \n We did this for my 8 years old Halloween Party and the effect was great, the kids and parents loved it! \n Make a couple of templates in different sizes ranging from small to large. The easiest way is to fold a piece of paper in half and draw out half a bat and then when you’re happy with the opened shape use this as a template to create the rest using black paper. Then simply place on the walls and ceilings using blue tack. It looks especially effective when the bats flock across a wall and into the corner of the room and up onto the ceiling. \n 
 These are listed under "Things You'll Need" below. \n This jug will provide the “skeleton” of your helmet, so try to determine the size using your own head as the model (or the intended Storm Trooper’s) to ensure a decent fit. \n Cut a round circle out of the bottom of the milk jug. This circle will be used as the top of your helmet so make sure it is a perfect circle. If possible, use a pencil and protractor or stencil. Label this part “B.” \n Cut an opening in the front of the same jug. Hold the milk jug by the handle and hold it so that you're looking at the front of the milk jug. The opening you cut is meant to accommodate the other milk jug; therefore, cut a rather large “C” shape into the front of the jug. Label this part “A.” \n \n Cut the top third of the second jug and put the remainder of the jug aside. \n Slice the opening off the second jug by creating a round circle on the top. Because the circle you cut from the first milk jug should fit on top, use that as a guide. Discard the remainder. \n Cut the top in half so that you're left with the front portion of the milk jug without a back. Label this part “C.” \n Turn on the hot glue gun and set at either low or medium. Be careful––if the glue is too hot, it may melt the plastic. \n Glue part “C” on top of part “A.” This will serve as the lower and front sides of the helmet. The top of the jug is the helmet “nose.” The top opening on the top of the part “C” should be on top where you will be able to affix part “B.” \n Glue part “B” into part “C.” Part “B” should fit snugly into the top of part “C.” Hold this piece together until the glue dries. \n Glue a milk cap on either side of the milk jug opening. Flip the cap upside down and affix the top of the cap to the mask. Make sure the caps are evenly distributed on either side of the jug hole. \n At this point you should have a helmet that you could place on your head. Now you can begin to add details so it resembles a real Storm Trooper helmet: \n Create eye-holes in the front. It’s important that you see while wearing this mask so put the mask on and have someone draw dots where your eye-holes should be. Make the eye-holes as small as possible since “eyes” were not overly apparent in the real Storm Trooper mask. \n Punch holes on either side of the back of the mask and thread the piece of elastic string through the holes. The elastic will hold your mask in place. Tie a knot on the outside end of the elastic to hold it in place. If you need to adjust the length, do so while threading the string. \n Spray paint your helmet completely white. Place the helmet on top of several newspapers, preferably in an outdoor area and spray the entire mask completely white. Allow the mask to dry for several hours or overnight. \n Add details using the electrical tape and black, white and grey craft paint. This is when the totally white mask transforms into a scary Storm Trooper helmet. Print out a photo of the real thing and follow the details based on the film helmet. Use the black electrical tape to form a band around the forehead area and cut a circle from the tape to seal the milk jug opening. Use the black Sharpie for adding in the more intricate details. \n These are listed under "Things You'll Need".\n Cut a circle out of the bottom of the jug, cut the handle of the jug as well. This jug will provide the “skeleton” of your helmet, so try to determine the size using your own head as the model (or the intended Storm Trooper’s) to ensure a decent fit. \n Leave about 3 inches (7.6 cm) plastic, this will be use to connect to the second jug to form the half of the helmet. \n The most important about what you're cutting with is that it does the job, the brand doesn't matter at all. \n You can see the Storm Trooper’s helmet already taking shape. \n Make sure you paint them black. If you have some broken or old or very cheap sunglasses hanging around your house you can disassemble it and glue them in the eyes, this would really add realism to your helmet. \n Add an old washing machine hose to act as a breathing apparatus use on board flying TIE Fighters. Enjoy and serve the dark side well soldier! \n 
\n For this one, write down the days of the week, leaving three lines for each day. \n One page for each day of the week. \n Do this quickly and without thinking, there will be time to edit and add to the list later. \n Is there anything on it that will take longer than 30 minutes of prep (not including cooking time)? Place a star by these items and reserve them for days when you have extra time such as the weekend or special occasions. \n Make notes by each one that can fit into topics. \n Mark (on your Master Weekly Plan) the day before as "Leftovers". For example, if you typically go grocery shopping on Tuesday, make Monday leftover night. \n Mark this day as "Quick Meal". For example, if you run errands on Thursday, mark Thursday as "Quick Meals." \n Place different categories on different days according to what you have. \n Whatever strikes your fancy until you have all the days filled in with a designated category. \n This will be your Current Menu. \n For example, if "Leftovers" is on Thursday, and today is Monday, write down Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Leave two lines for each day. \n Make sure you have matching side dishes, if necessary, as well. \n Be sure to include whatever side dishes you may want. \n
 For example, you're never going to convince your headteacher to let your school have a 10 week Christmas holiday or change the uniform to pink. He/she will not be impressed if you waste their time over something ridiculous.\n It is VERY important to choose reliable people who are known for being polite and trustworthy, and not people who may become aggressive or rude. Do not bring more than about 4 people. \n Don't just barge into their office and spring your visit upon them unannounced as he or she may be busy. Let them know if you are bringing other people with you. \n Knock on their door, and go in only when invited. \n I'm here because I would like to discuss the possibility of arranging earlier study leave." \n For example, "I realise that you may have concerns over whether the idea of having water fountains around school may invite problems with people misusing them. However, I think this could be solved by having prefect monitors or teachers around to make sure nobody causes trouble." \n "I have spoken with teachers and some of my fellow students about this and they all agree that this would be a good thing to do." \n So if you were trying to make it so that students were allowed to bring mobile phones to school, you might say, "Many parents worry about their children walking home from school on their own and would feel much better if they knew that they had a way of contacting them if they got into trouble." \n LISTEN to what they have to say. \n You want to stay on their good side, and appear polite and mature. If it is appropriate, shake their hand. \n 
 The tops of your feet should be flat on the floor, and your hands palms down to either side of you. \n Try to make sure all ten of your fingers and all ten of your toes are pressing into the floor. Your toes should never be tucked under you for this pose.\n You want your palms slightly lower than your shoulder, so that the tips of your finger are roughly right below your shoulder muscles. Spread your fingers and press your palms into the floor evenly. You'll be only a few inches off the floor at this point, your spine still mostly straight. \n Be sure to keep your elbows close to your body, pointing behind you instead of out to the sides. \n You want to engage your abs to protect your lower back. Focus on keeping these muscles engaged throughout the exercise -- this will keep your thighs firmly on the ground as you bend upwards. \n If you feel your hips lifting up from the floor, use your abs to push your pelvis back towards the floor. \n Keeping your hands, your hips, and the tops of your feet firmly planted on the floor, begin to lift your upper torso. Tilt your chin upward and lift your chest toward the ceiling, as if exposing your heart to the sky. Right now your chest should only be 8-12" from the floor. \n Remember: you can use your hands for support, but don't put too much pressure in them yet. Try to let your back and abs do most of the work to lift you. \n If it feels uncomfortable to tilt your chin up, try keeping your neck straight and gazing at the floor. Your head should be relaxed and comfortable., Try to hold cobra pose for five full breaths before gently releasing to the floor or stretching back further. If you start to feel pain or tightness in your back, release the pose immediately. \n Push back slowly, using your arms, abs, and back together to deepen the stretch. As you exhale, focus on bending back just a few more centimeters. Control your breathing, stretch for 1-2 breaths, then keep pushing back to get a higher, more advanced cobra pose. \n You may or may not be able to straighten your arms in this pose, depending on how long your arms are. If your pelvis begins to lift off the floor when you straighten your arms, keep a slight bend in your elbows. Remember-- keeping your lower body still is more important than going back further. \n The better your form, the healthier and more beneficial the pose will be. Watch the attached videos, focusing on how each muscle and joint seems both relaxed and in line, not wildly splayed out. To review, you should: \n Keep the tops of your feet, thighs, hips, and palms firmly on the floor at all times. \n Keep your shoulders down and back, away from your ears. \n Your fingers and toes should be splayed for balance, but still light and loose -- you should be able to freely wiggle every digit. \n Move slowly, taking deep, controlled breathes. \n Focus on a solid core, contracting your abdominal muscles to help move. \n Your hands will be by your heart. Slowly bring them up above your head, then drop them down to the ground, as if you were touching your toes. Remember to bend from your hips -- it is okay if you can't touch the ground yet. \n You can bend your knees if you must. You want your palms down so that your fingers are under your shoulders. Your hands should be roughly shoulder-width apart. \n You'll be in a plank, with both palms at your sides and your feet kicked back. You should be resting on your toes, but you can also skip ahead and rest on the tops of your feet if it doesn't hurt your ankles. Your knees should be on the ground. \n You'll form a little zig-zag, with your feet and chin down low and your butt in the air. This position is just a quick, transitory position. \n This is the cobra movement -- your lower body will hit the floor as your back bends and your head comes up. When finished, you should be in a cobra pose. \n If this motion is hard at first, Just work on dropping your butt down so that your hips are on the floor. You can then adjust your hands and feet so that you're in cobra. \n You'll generally be transitioning into downward dog from here. Lower down so that, briefly, your entire body is lying on the floor. \n This will feel very similar to a basic push-u position. \n Push up first to your knees, with your butt high. Then keep moving until your legs are straight. Your palms and soles of your feet should be planted firmly on the ground, your butt in the air, so that you from a triangle with the ground. \n Keep your toes and fingers splayed and comfortable. You should be able to wiggle all twenty digits. \n You arms and legs should all be straight, with only a slight bend in the knees and elbows. \n If cobra pose is challenging for you, take it slow and bend your back very gently. It is perfectly fine to stay in a very low cobra pose instead of advancing to a high cobra. You should never force your back to bend if it is not comfortable, as this can lead to serious injury. \n If you feel discomfort in your back when your palms are on the floor, try resting your forearms on the floor with your elbows under your shoulders for sphinx pose. \n You can also perform cobra pose standing up by placing your hands against a wall and pushing them down, just as you would push against the floor in a traditional cobra. Open your chest and arch your back by drawing your shoulder blades towards each other and tilting your head slightly back. This is a great variation to choose if you are pregnant. \n If cobra pose is easy for you, you can continue to improve your strength, flexibility, and balance by adding new variations to the pose. \n To challenge your balance while in cobra pose, bend your right knee and grab your ankle with your right hand for half frog pose. Hold for five breaths, relax, and repeat on the other side. Grab for your ankle with your opposite hand for an even greater challenge. \n If you want to get a slightly deeper back bend in cobra pose, try placing yoga blocks under your hands. \n Lift your hands a few inches off the floor in order to challenge your balance and further engage the muscles in your back., Only progress to a deeper back bend if cobra pose is easy for you and you are looking for something more challenging. Upward facing dog pose is similar to cobra pose, but offers a deeper back bend because the hips and upper legs are lifted off of the ground and more weight is placed in the hands. \n Many people confuse cobra pose and upward facing dog. Remember, if you are doing cobra pose, your hips should be planted firmly on the ground and there should be minimal weight in your hands. \n There are lots of other great choices for back bends too, including wheel pose, bridge pose, and camel pose, just to name a few. Choose the one that works best for you, or try incorporating all of them into your yoga practice. \n Instead of practicing cobra pose in isolation, practice it as part of a sequence of poses. This is the way you will practice cobra pose in most yoga classes. \n A vinyasa flow typically involves a transition from upward facing dog or cobra pose to chaturanga, which is a yoga push up, and finally to downward facing dog. This sequence may be repeated multiple times in a row or at many different times throughout class.There are many different sun salutations, but most involve mountain pose and a standing forward bend, followed by a vinyasa flow. Warrior I, warrior II, and warrior III poses are common in sun salutations as well., You should avoid cobra pose if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or other wrist injuries, if you have recently had surgery, or if you have back problems that are irritated by bending.If you are pregnant, you should avoid lying on your stomach for this pose, but you can modify the pose by standing up with your hands against a wall and bending your spine the same way you would for the traditional version of the pose. \n If you have never practiced yoga before, talk to your doctor to make sure you are healthy enough to begin a yoga practice and to discuss any modifications you should make to your practice. \n Make sure you wear clothes that will allow you to move freely and will not distract you during your yoga practice. \n You may want to have a small towel to place under your hands to prevent them from slipping on your mat if you begin to sweat. \n If you are practicing outside of a yoga class, try to find a quiet space that is free from distractions for your yoga practice. You should have enough room to lay out your yoga mat and extend your arms in all directions without hitting anything. \n You can take cobra pose to a few different levels, depending on the flexibility of your spine. No matter how flexible you are, start off with a gentle back bend to get your body warmed up. \n Make sure to stick to your own limits and try not to compare yourself to others in order to get the most out of your practice and avoid injury. \n If you are taking a yoga class, your instructor will probably have you do a "low cobra" or "baby cobra" at the beginning, and will later allow you to work up to a "high cobra" pose if this works for you. This progression allows you to slowly warm up your spine. \n

When a translation is selected the survey's control buttons, such as the Next and Back buttons, and the system messages such as "A response is required", will be displayed in the selected language. \n Example of the survey shown with English (British) language selected: \n Example of the survey shown with English (US) language selected: \n Example if the survey shown with French language selected: \n As all the results are collated into a single dataset, it is possible to conduct a multi-language survey and have the results automatically consolidated in the language of your choice, so that you can easily understand the results. \n When the respondent starts to complete the survey it will automatically check to see if the respondent's keyboard language setting matches any of the available survey translations and if it does find a match that language will be selected as the default. \n A respondent can select from any of the available languages. \n 
 Notice the amount of time they dedicate to being with you, and the joy they express when spending family time with you. Imagine what it would be like to put yourself in their shoes. If you were your mom or your dad, how would you like to be treated by your own children? How would it feel to have to manage the many responsibilities they have in your household? What decisions would you make if you were in your parents’ position? Thank them for the big things they do, like staying up all night with you when you’re sick, as well as for the little things, like bringing you a cup of hot tea or helping you choose a dress for a special occasions.\n Although sometimes parents may seem overly-strict or embarrassingly old-fashioned, for example; Insisting that you respect them as well as your other elders by referring to them as "Sir", or "Madam", you must respect the fact that often their guidance toward you reflects wisdom that has been passed down from their own parents and elders. This type of strict guidance is an essential part of their teachings to insure that your able to grow up to be a good, descent, productive and respectful adult. \n But "NEVER" be afraid of discussing problems that you are having with your parents. You have to tell them if you have issues, they can't help you with things they aren't aware of. It's their job as a parent to help you through things. \n Often, when they ask you to do things that seem ridiculous or totally unfair, it’s because they want what’s best for you, and they want to teach you a very important and valuable lesson, that... "Sometimes in life things aren't always fair a big portion of the time". \n Avoid arguments with them even if sometimes they seem unfair. Remember that above all, it's your parents that should make the final decision for you and that it's inappropriate for you to try to have the last word. A mature approach on your part includes having a calm and respectful attitude at the end of the conversation and accept that as they are your parents, their will must be your way. In time this will earn their trust in you, and it will demonstrate to them that you are well on your way to becoming a competent well rounded individual who will soon be capable of making your own good decisions, and be responsible for your actions. Don't talk back to your parents because when they are strict they are only trying to teach you responsibility and they only want the best for you. \n Your parents make a lot of sacrifices for you, so reward their efforts with gratitude, obedience and a positive respectful attitude. Remember that these ways that they are teaching you will be so very valuable to you when you grow older and become parents of your own children. You will be able to convey to your own kids the family values you were taught while growing up at home. Remember this, would you want your children behaving with you, the way you may be behaving at home now? Never forget to apologize if you've argued with them; remember that they have feelings, too. \n If you have younger siblings, help them with their homework and their chores, be a model of good behavior for them and try to encourage their obedience to you just as you are obedient to your parents. This will help build a strong and loving family structure for your whole family. \n If at all possible, help them out. Earn some money of your own and save it to help pay for a portion of your clothing and entertainment. \n Parents by nature need to know and feel that their children have a great love for them. Be affectionate and give them just as many hugs and kisses as they give you, and do it as often as you wish. There never need be a special occasion reserved for doing this. Love costs nothing, and you can and should want to give it freely. It's what all parents hope and wish for from their beloved children, and I promise you this, the warm feeling you get in your heart for such acts as these last a lifetime. \n Your parents can be the best friends you’ll ever have. They have rich lives and their years of stories are invaluable treasures. \n Even if you don't live near them. You’ll be grateful for the time you spent with them when they're gone, and you’ll regret the lost opportunity if you don’t visit them. \n Invite them to movies, family dinners and on family vacation. \n If your parents are elderly and have a hard time driving or getting around, take them to see their friends, to go shopping, to restaurants and out for walks. \n If you have children, let them visit your parents as often as possible. A loving relationship between grandparents and grandchildren is one of the joys of life (not to mention free babysitting!). \n Just like you were when you were a kid! \n Be affectionate and give them hugs and kisses (they still love it!). \n Apologize if you've argued with them; remember that they have feelings, too. \n Thank them for helping to make you the wonderful person you've become. \n Now that you have income, spoil them the way they spoiled you. Bring them small gifts like flowers, chocolates or a book you think they might enjoy. Give them big gifts on their birthdays and important holidays. \n Everyday, take the opportunity to tell your parents you love them. \n 
 The obvious difference is not just that the 310 has more controls to operate the engines, it also has many more features in all parts of the aircraft. (covered later) \n A first glance inside the cockpit at the 310 panel will reveal many more instruments and controls, and more modern ones. \n \n Two tachometers \n Two manifold pressure gauges \n Two sets of engine temperature and pressure gauges.\n \n The most noticeable difference, for this article, is in the Dual Control Pedestal. \n The controls from left to right are: \n Two throttles. \n Two propeller controls. \n Two fuel mixture controls. \n Two fuel tank controls. Under the pedestal. \n \n This panel has the newer "Glass Panel" which has all the instrumentation of the six pack panel, but concentrated into one glass panel, in a different format where airspeed and altitude are in vertical bar displays. \n Note that three round gauges below the glass panel, were kept for backup. In case of glass panel failure. \n Airspeed Indicator. \n Artificial Horizon. \n Altimeter. \n Memorize these speeds, you are sure to be asked about them in the oral test. These speeds vary with each aircraft, check in the manual of your aircraft. \n VMC-93 knots. Minimum control speed. The airspeed, below which, the aircraft cannot be controlled, in flight with one engine out. \n Vyse-106 knots. Best-Rate-of-Climb. The speed giving the best climb on one engine. \n Vxse-95 knots. Best-Angle-of-Climb. The speed giving the best climb to clear a 50 feet (15.2 m) airport departure obstacle on one engine. \n \n Must have a minimum of 10 hours of flight time, with an FAA qualified Flight Instructor, in a twin engine aircraft. \n Must have made at least 5 take-offs and landings in the last 90 days, in a twin. \n Sufficient training to master flight with one engine shut down. \n Ground training in performing a more complicated pre-flight walk-around. \n Know all the special speed, and other requirements with operation on both engines, and with one engine off. \n Pass an oral exam with an FAA Inspector in all the items above. \n Pass a flight check, with an FAA inspector, demonstrating all of the above. \n The following is an example of most check items, use the checklist from your aircraft manual. \n Remove all control locks, internal and external, if installed. \n Check condition of elevator, rudder, trim tabs, hinge bolts and actuator rods. \n Check static pressure holes for obstruction. \n Check baggage compartment and door. \n Check ailerons in same manor as elevator. \n Check Main and auxiliary fuel tank filler caps are secure. \n Check landing gear for damage. \n Check engine oil. Minimum 9 US quarts (9,000 ml), full 12 quarts. \n Drain some fuel from strainer and check for water or contamination. \n Check Main landing gear, tire, and gear door secure. \n Check propeller and spinner for nicks or scratches. \n Check oil filler cap. \n Check cowl doors secure. \n Check nose gear. \n Check pitot tube for obstruction. \n Check taxi light. \n Be sure to perform the same checks both sides of aircraft. \n Remove tie-downs. \n (Use your aircraft check list). \n Landing gear switch in down position. (Before turning power on). \n Elevator and aileron trimmed for takeoff. \n Check throttle friction knobs for proper friction. \n Set mixture to full rich. \n Prop controls to full forward. \n Set flaps at recommend position, some use 10degrees. Check your manual. (Do not confuse flap switch with landing gear switch). \n Fuel selector valves set to main tank. \n Carburetor heat, to cold (Full forward). \n Check fuel gauges for sufficient fuel. \n Boost pumps on. \n Controls free and movement correct. \n Cowl flaps open. \n \n Check all 4 fuel gauges for full tank, if appropriate. \n The 310 has 4 fuel tanks, two 50 gal. wing tip tanks and two 15 gallon (56.8 L). aux tanks, giving you a possible range of 1000 miles. \n The total fuel weight is 1170 lbs. so beware of over loading the aircraft. You may have to leave some fuel behind. \n (If in a clear area). Follow your aircraft manual. \n Start the left engine first since the battery is located there. \n Start the right engine. \n Check both engine instruments in the green. \n Altimeter set to field elevation. \n Gyros set. \n Doors and windows properly locked. \n Seat belts on, including passengers. (No passengers allowed until getting your Multiengine Certificate. \n \n A 310 run-up will be the same as a complex single engine run-up, per engine. \n Check magnetos, carburetor heat, Prop controls, per your 310 aircraft manual. \n \n Before taking off from any airport in any aircraft, calculate the required runway length for your aircraft, fully loaded. See your aircraft manual. \n With a multiengine aircraft, you have to check, not only the required runway length, but the "Start-Stop" distance for your aircraft. \n Start-Stop distance is the distance required, for this aircraft to accelerate at full speed to VMC, then bring the aircraft to a full stop on the runway. The distance should be approximately 2400 feet of runway in the average 310. \n Some pilots like to double this number to 5000 feet and use that as the minimum runway for this aircraft. \n Single Engine Service Ceiling of a later model turbo 310 is approximately 17000 ft., but, an early model 310 is only about 7700 ft. Check your manual and memorize your maximum service ceiling. Best not to land at an airport elevation above 7000 ft. if you have an early model 310. \n \n Apply both mixture controls to maximum, or as stated in your manual. \n Apply both propeller controls to maximum, or as stated in your manual. \n Apply both throttle controls to maximum, or as stated in your manual. \n Stay on runway center line with rudder as required. \n Verify max propeller to be at least 2600 RPM, or as per manual. \n Check engine gauges are in the green, as required. \n Watch airspeed for VMC (Velocity Minimum Control)\n Do not rotate until VMC, 96knots, or as required. \n (If you need to clear a 50 ft. obstacle, use Best-angle-of-Climb. \n Maintain Best-Rate-of-climb,106 knots. \n Establish stabilized climb at 106 knots, Verify rate at least 500 fpm, vertical climb indicator. \n Once positive climb is established, Gear up, ease flaps up (If any flap used). \n Maintain climb at 25 inches Manifold Pressure at 2400 RPM until reaching desired altitude. \n \n Lower nose slightly and reduce power, throttle, to 23 inches manifold pressure. \n Set prop control to 2300 RPM for best cruise power of 65% power. \n Maintain this power setting and hold altitude with small adjustments of yoke and throttle. \n Trim as desired to maintain cruise altitude. \n You'll be tested by an FAA Inspector on engine out recognition and recovery. \n Have your instructor walk you through engine out procedures, first at a safe altitude. \n The instructor will show you how to tell which engine failed and how to fly the aircraft on one engine. \n The instructor may kill one engine when you least expect it. \n You'll have to demonstrate your ability to perform the following procedures. \n \n The cockpit will suddenly get a little quieter and the aircraft will yaw in the direction of the dead engine. This is more difficult at night. \n Practice this, at a safe altitude, and at night. Try using needle ball, it may help by showing the sudden change of yaw. \n \n First verify the throttles are both on full power, both prop controls in full forward, and mixtures in full rich. \n Some pilots use the "Dead Foot Dead Engine" procedure. Meaning, if the left engine failed, you'll have to push a lot of right rudder to fly straight, if left foot isn't needed, then the left engine must be dead. \n Some say, "That's simple, the prop will stop and the RPM will drop". \n Well, in actuality, the prop continues to spin at the same RPM. \n A windmilling prop has the same drag as a solid disk of the same diameter so you need to get the prop feathered and stopped immediately. \n \n Now that you've identified the dead engine, verify full power is applied to the good engine. \n \n Reduce the drag from the bad engine prop by putting the prop into feather position. (Prop Control all the way back). \n Feathering puts the prop edgeways to the wind to eliminate drag, and stop the prop from rotating. \n You don't need the extreme drag of a windmilling prop which will cause the aircraft to be un-controllable. \n \n Get the aircraft flying straight ahead with no loss of altitude. \n Try to maintain straight ahead flight. Raising the dead engine side wing higher to balance out the good engine power and dead engine drag and yaw conditions. \n Always practice dead engine procedures at a safe altitude. \n Always hold the dead engine wing high until landing (but, Only if you really have a dead engine). \n \n ADS-B, or (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), is a cornerstone of Next Generation air traffic modernization. \n Mandated soon by the FAA for all aircraft operating in airspace that now requires a Mode C transponder must be equipped with ADS-B. \n This new system, when properly installed and operated, will allow the pilot to see, and be seen, and avoid all other aircraft in the vicinity. \n In addition to aircraft traffic, in flight services and weather information can also be sent to the pilot in flight. \n 
 Some sports have an early fall season, such as women's soccer, and by the time a collegiate team is ready for try-outs and to start scouting a few players, your season may have ended. Game footage will play a large role in continuing your athletic career.\n Like game footage, this will also be another factor that can help improve your chances of being looked at by a scout or being asked to come to open try-outs. \n Most schools will have some type of Athletic Questionnaire you can fill out to let them know you are interested in possibly playing there. \n A bad-timed injury at the end of your season could strongly affect your chances of being able to play in college. If a coach thinks you are injury prone, they may not be willing to take that risk with their scholarship money. \n Include as much as possible that might put you over the edge against another player being considered. \n It may be 3 months after your season has ended and you haven't touched a ball or ran a foot since your last game. Run a few extra miles and work on some touches or work on getting familiar with the skills again so you are not left looking like an amateur at the try out. \n In any sport, the game is more fast-paced, more skilled, and more competitive. It is completely different. Don't let that affect your game. You have made it to try-outs or farther, so the coaches obviously see something they can use. You deserve to be there based on your skills and ability of play. \n This is where you will sign your intent to play your college career with the school. This is usually a big day with lots of photographs so dress nice and bring your parents along. \n Don't let your grades or attendance slack off. Your athletic scholarship is pending on your grades and graduation of high school. \n All athletes that play any sport after high school must be cleared. They will give you the website address and possibly a code for your school. You will need to have good grades and attendance and a good standing to be cleared. \n Most importantly, keep in shape. You will work harder than you ever did in high school so you need to prepare your body for the physical intensity that will be new to you. \n 
\n Don't overdo the shopping. Just go as per the requirements of your list. \n Quickly take a warm shower (it helps, any season) \n This breathing should inflate your stomach during inhalation and flatten it during exhalation. Do this for 10 minutes (keep a timer if necessary). It relaxes you immediately. \n Try to look relaxed and presentable (take deep breaths, whenever you can). \n Or better still, invite them to the kitchen to help you. \n As you've had a busy day, you will automatically tend to think of it and the conversation might revolve around it. Instead try to think of something positive about your guests and make it a point to discuss about the same. \n Introduce humor into your conversation as everyone could use some at the end of a day. Listen more, do not lead the conversation towards yourself or how tiring your day was, lest your guests feel unwelcome. \n Don't crash on that inviting couch but finish off this chore as soon as possible. Help is a must-get. If you don't have help, try to finish only the amount you can manage before you are completely burned out. \n Try adding some herbal/olive oil into the water for better sleep and a fresh new you in the morning! \n 
 \n Add the seed number. You can either leave the random one given or put in one of your own. \n Add the world name. You can either leave the 'My World 1' given or put in one of your own. \n Touch/click next.\n \n Add the name. \n Touch/click next. \n It may take a while, so take it gradually and be patient. When you do find him, talk to him and take his quest.\n Go to the nearest tree. \n Touch/click and hold on the trunk until a block falls \n Walk over the block that fell to pick it up. \n Repeat as often as required. \n \n Put all of the wood you collected into the crafting grid in your inventory. \n Touch/click and hold onto the planks it will show under the crafting grid until there is nothing left. \n If you did the introduction correctly, you should know how to make them., Find an oak tree and see if it has wax on it. If it does, then collect the wax. If it doesn't, then find another oak tree., Search a cave, look under a low floating island, look in a river, or look on a cliff., You can find the crafting recipe in the crafting book (located in the inventory!). It will be in the items section of the crafting book., The candle recipe will be located under 'blocks' in the crafting book., If it's not, then continue., If you chose a cliff, then get all the ore from it and start a little mine. If you chose a cave, then get some stone from it and start a little mine.,)., Keep going until you run into a monster., They will not be in your crafting book yet. You make them in the same way as stone swords except with gold instead of stone.\n First destroy the spawner. \n Then attack it with your gold swords until it dies. \n You will have to get 10 gold ore and 20 gold ore to do this quest., If you don't already have the gold and coal, then get it., Before you go to Paula. Make some flippers (the recipe is in the crafting book under 'armor') and do Ted's next 2 quests. Then, get your stuff and search for a spot with both Paula and Shadow hunter in the area. When you do find a spot then put down your stuff and get her first quest., The recipe is found under tools in the crafting book., When you make it to the mountain, look for a spawner that's not spawning anything. Then set up a monster proof base near the spawner, but not close enough for the monster spawner to spawn something in your base., When nightfall comes, watch the spawner closely until something spawns. When it does spawn: \n Grab some of your strongest weapons (such as hunting knifes, or gold swords). \n Kill it. \n Repeat until you have killed it 20 times. \n Now you're free to do all the quests you want, fight all the battles you want, and do whatever you want.

 You will need this to make the dough.\n Put these in your food processor and press your pulse button. \n Incorporate these into the mixture. Press the pulse button, and blend these ingredients until the mixture is hard and resembles gravel. \n Add this to the mixture as well, and press the pulse button, allowing the mixture to have a few more "rounds" of blending. \n Set on a flat surface and separate the mixture into 2 disks (these should be rolled). Bring out plastic wrap, which should be used to cover the mixture. \n Then, gather a medium saucepan and place your newly chopped cherries in the saucepan. \n Set your saucepan to medium heat and allow the mixture to heat up, and mix consistently. \n Place in a small bowl. Add some cornstarch and blend well. \n Continue allowing it to cook gently below a boiling point, and be sure to mix together throughout the time. In approximately 6 to 8 minutes, the batter should have thickened very much. \n Thoroughly cover a surface that's flat (and not dirty) with very much flour. \n Continue this process until your dough is still thick (an-eighth of an inch). \n Use it to create squares from your dough through a cutting process. Place some of the cherries (1 1/2 tbsp. of them) on the center of the square. \n Rub an amount of water extending directly over two adjoining sides of each square. \n Do this through a folding process. \n Put them in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastries are completely browned. Allow them to cool before serving; use a cooling rack if necessary. \n
 At this time, you can also prepare your cupcake pan by inserting the paper liners into the wells.\n You can do this using a handheld mixer or an electric mixer with a paddle attachment. To make mixing even easier, cut the butter into cubes first. \n Beat the eggs in one at a time, then add the vanilla extract with the second egg. \n To avoid any lumps and clumps, pour the flour and baking powder through a sifter. \n Do not over-mix the batter, or the cupcakes will be tough. For a more complex flavor, add 1 tablespoon of toasted poppy seeds., An ice cream scooper is a great way to do this. It is quick, easy, and it will ensure that each liner gets the same amount of batter. \n The cupcakes are done when the edges turn golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. Another way to tell if the cupcakes are done is by pressing on one of the domes; if it bounces back up, it's done. \n Let them cool in the pan for 10 minutes first, then transfer them to a baking rack to finish cooling. Choose a frosting or glaze from below to decorate your cupcakes with. \n You can do this using an electric mixer or a handheld mixer fitted with paddles. This recipe will give you a frosting that is rich and creamy, perfect for spreading or piping. \n If you don't have any heavy cream, you can use half-and-half instead. At this point, you can also add other ingredients to alter the flavor of your icing. \n If you'd like to make lemon buttercream, add 2 tablespoons of lemon zest, 3 tablespoons of lemon juice.If you'd like, you can also add in a few drops of yellow food coloring. \n If you'd like to make blackberry buttercream, use only 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and add ½ cup (165 grams) of seedless blackberry jam., Depending on what you added to the frosting, and how thick you like it, you might not even have to use all of the sugar. \n If the frosting is too thin, add more confecitoner's/icing sugar. If the icing is too thick, add more heavy cream. \n You can do this simply by spreading the buttercream on using a spatula. or fancier cupcakes, you can pipe them on using a piping bag and a decorator's tip. \n This icing is much more delicate than the typical frosting or buttercream. It is glaze-like and perfect for pouring or drizzling. \n How much liquid you add will depend on how thick or thin you want your glaze to be. Keep in mind that it will harden once it sets. \n If you'd like to make a lemon glaze, use lemon juice instead., If you are making lemon glaze, consider skipping the extract and using 2 teaspoons of lemon zest instead., If the mixture is too thin, add some more confectioners'/icing sugar. If the mixture is too thick, add more of whatever liquid you were using. If you were using lemon, however, consider using just water so as not to overpower the other flavors. \n After a few minutes, the icing will set and harden. If the icing layer is too thin, wait until it hardens, then pour or drizzle more on. \n 
 Sites like Tokyo Roomfinder and Japan Homefinder are there to give you insight into what is available in the area you want to stay in. \n There are foreigner-friendly rental agencies specifically to help people new to Japan find accommodations. Foreigners typically find difficulty finding housing in the traditional housing market.Apartment finders and real estate sites will have plenty of listings of potential places you should look into.\n Here are some key terms to know: \n 1K is a one room apartment with a kitchen. \n 1DK is a one room apartment with dining room and kitchen. \n 2LDK is a two room apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen. \n There are real-estate services that will have the connections to set you on the right course. If you're not yet fluent in speaking Japanese, it helps to bring a Japanese friend along with you to interpret what's being said.Only apartments that are currently vacant will be viewable by new prospective tentants.Real estates tend to focus their efforts on specific neighbourhoods. Because of this, you should figure out what neighbourhood you would prefer to live in before linking up with an agent. \n Able is a well-known real estate service., Even if there's a specific area you're planning on living in, you should still have a fair degree of options available to you. Because Japan's urban layout is so dense, you may find multiple potential places that are all within walking distance of one another. \n Apartment rates will vary wildly depending on the closeness to a city centre you're renting in. In a city centre, rates will vary from 100000-200000 ¥ per month. Outside of a city centre, rates tend to vary from 50000-150000 ¥ per month, depending on the size and amount of rooms in the apartment. This roughly equals to 1000-2000 USD and 500-1000 USD respectively. \n If you're budget savvy, you may try getting a room at a jiko bukken. These properties are seen as tainted because a tenant died there from unnatural causes. Because a potentially "haunted" house is more difficult to sell, you may get a deal on it., Companies such as Leopalace21 and UR acknowledge the difficulties of finding lodging in Japan, and offer short-term accommodations that can be renewed on a weekly basis. \n Leopalace21 hires staff with experience in English, making it a perfect choice for people coming from abroad., Here are the important documents you will need: \n A copy of your passport (if you're a foreigner.) \n A copy of your residence card. \n Recent pay slips or bank statement, to prove that you have the money to pay.A domestic emergency contact, to call in case there's a problem and someone needs to get involved. This should be a Japanese person that can otherwise vouch for you. \n Verification of employment. Many agencies will only hire you if you can prove that you will make at least 300% of what your rent will cost.A character reference. As in Western cultures, a character reference is a quick letter from someone indicating that they're dependable. This will give the landlord some bonus assurance that you're reliable when it comes to keeping the apartment responsibly. \n A guarantor is required in order to sign any tenancy agreement. This refers to an individual that will vouch for you and pay up the slack for you if you fail to meet the terms of the agreement. A guarantor needs to be a Japanese national. If you cannot find a guarantor of your own, there are agencies that will act as guarantor for you for a nominal fee., If you're looking for a place, you may need as much as six months rent just to get started with a place. Here are some of the fees you should look out for: \n A real estate agent's fee called “Chukai Tesuryo". This is non-refundable and is typically one month’s rent. \n A security deposit called shikikin. This is typically two or three months' rent.You are also expected to provide a gift to the landlord. This is referred to as a reikin. Unlike the security deposit, this is non-refundable. It is typically between 1-2 months rent. \n A reservation fee called tetsukeikin. It’s refunded as soon as you sign contracts. This is the agency's way of making sure you’re serious about the deal. \n Above all, the Japanese respect politeness, punctuality and civility. You should take great lengths to coming across as a consummate professional when you meet a landlord to discuss contract agreements. This includes being to the meeting on time (or early, if possible), and dressing as you would to a job interview. \n Some landlords won't rent to foreigners or non-Japanese races based on the perceived friction it may create. If you're new to the country, this may make it more difficult for you.Unfortunately, discrimination cases don't usually go through in Japan currently. However, you should still file a complaint nonetheless if you feel you're being discriminated against based on your race.If you are having trouble finding a landlord who will take foreigners, you may want to go through a foreigner-friendly real estate agent. \n Once you have found a place you want and the landlord has accepted you, it's time to sign a contact. Take extra time to read through the contact, and get a Japanese friend to interpret the writing for you if you aren't yet fluent. \n Make sure to have all of the money needed to pay your fees in advance of signing the agreement. \n Above all, Japanese apartments tend to be much smaller than their Western equivalents. The walls are thinner. This makes it so that sound carries between apartments easier. In addition, most older Japanese buildings do not have Western toilets. Instead, they have "squatter" toilets. If you're new to living in Japan, this may take some getting used to. \n Much like the West, outlets like IKEA and even Craigslist are perfect for finding furniture at a relative discount. In addition, because there are many foreigners staying in Japan for a fixed amount of time, some rental agencies will rent you the furniture for a given amount of time. This way, you won't have to buy the furniture new. \n Regulations and discipline are highly regarded in Japanese culture. Each apartment contract should have its regulations listed. Talk to your landlord if you're unsure. \n Japanese society values its peace and quiet. There is an understanding that you won't play music or be loud during the day or night. If you need to let loose, you may do so in a public area. Residences should be seen as places of rest rather than recreation. \n Above all, a successful stay in a Japanese apartment will be defined by how well you get along with fellow tenants in the building. Go out of your way to treat others with respect, and do what you can to accommodate them. Chances are the other tenants will offer you the same respect in turn. \n If you are a Westerner planning on coming to Japan to stay, be aware of some of the negative stereotypes the Japanese people may have. Some Japanese see foreigners as unnecessarily crude and loud. If you show them how polite you can be, you'll force them to rethink this position. \n
