 You can buy a whirlpool tub that fits in the same space as a regular tub. Replacing your tub with a larger size adds steps to the process. However, some people enjoy the extra space of a larger tub.\n You will probably need an electrical permit. In some areas, a special wall access to the motor and pump is required. \n Reuse your P trap if it is plastic and in good condition. Replace your P trap if it is metal or in bad shape. \n \n Cover the floor with a drop cloth. Use a plumb line and level to mark the area of old tile that needs to be removed. Make sure that the new tile will cover the joint from the drywall you are about to remove. \n Use a utility knife to cut through the drywall. If you use a saw, you are more likely to hit wiring or plumbing. Use a pry bar to pull out the tile in large sections or piece by piece. If necessary, you can use a hammer to make a hole in the tile to get you started at the top. Wear safety glasses while you are removing the tile. \n Check the wall insulation. If it is dry and not moldy, you can reuse it. Otherwise it will have to be replaced. Cover moldy areas of the wall with a formula to preserve wood once they are dry before replacing the insulation. \n \n Old tub removal can take place in a few ways. You can take it out whole or break it into pieces to remove it. Fiberglass or steel tubs can be broken into pieces with a reciprocating saw. Cast iron tubs can be broken with a sledgehammer. If you decide to break the tub, you should wear safety glasses. You may also want to wear earplugs. \n \n Draw in your center lines. Make sure they are appropriate for the layout you have planned for your tile. \n Install a 2 by 4 inch (5 by 10 cm) backing for your faucet using the dimensions recommended in the instructions. If necessary, install tub spout and shower head backers. \n Assemble the copper pipes and solder them together. If you are soldering onto the valve, be certain to take off the cartridge beforehand. Also, you should wait to solder the tub spout until after you have put in the tub. \n Check to make certain that the P trap will reach the new drain. If it needs to be extended, extend it at this time. \n \n Different tubs are leveled in different ways, so it is important to follow the directions that came with your new whirlpool tub. In any case, the floor, not the rim of the tub, should support the tub's weight. Check the underlying structure if the floor is more than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) out of level. Install the edge supports according to the instructions included with your tub. \n \n If your tub does not fit at first, remove more drywall and then replace it. \n Roll some plumber's putty into a rope with a diameter of about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm.) place the putty on the base of the drain and then insert the drain through the drain hole. Use a tub drain wrench to hold the drain in place and be certain the putty squeezes out on all sides of the edge of the drain. Tighten the waste line until the rubber seal is snug while holding the drain in place. \n Mortar underneath the tub and seat the tub in the mortar. Do not put any weight on the tub until the mortar has fully hardened, at least overnight. \n Tighten all nuts by hand and then give them a quarter turn with slip joint pliers. \n Cut the spout to the length specified in the faucet instructions. \n \n Connect the faucet handles temporarily. Open the water shutoffs and then turn on the faucets. \n Check all joints and seals for moisture. If there is any moistness, re-tighten the slip nuts and check joints for broken washers. \n Fill the tub until it reaches the overflow and starts to drain through it and check to make sure that the overflow doesn't leak. \n Plug in the electricity for tub and start the jets running. With the jets running, check for leaks again. \n
 You can also choose to purchase them online if you do not need them right away.\n It is important that your car does not sink or roll away while resting on a jack or on jack stands. \n If any of the wheels you will be working on has hubcaps, use a wrench or screwdriver to remove them. \n It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs. \n Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the care up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the care are: \n Your owner’s manual will recommend jacking points \n The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack or trolley jack. \n You should use jack stands to stabilize the car. \n If you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time. \n At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. Place wheels under the car as back-up protection in case the jack stands fail. \n This cap will be in the center of the hub and can be removed by simply prying away from the hub. This will expose the retaining nut., There will be a pin in front of the retaining nut that prevents the nut from loosening (referred to as a cotter pin). Remove it by straightening the bent end of the pin and prying it out of its hole with pliers or a screwdriver., Using a wrench or ratchet, turn the nut counter-clockwise (to the left) to loosen it. If the nut is stuck lubricate it with WD-40 or similar lubricant. \n Some drums have small bolts holding them to the hub. If this is the case you will need to remove those bolts. , Pull the drum straight off of the hub. You may have to wiggle a little to get it started. If the drum appears stuck and will not pull off, you should: \n Check to make sure all bolts holding the drum to the hub are removed. \n Check to see if the drum is getting caught on the brake shoes., This step is only necessary if your drum is getting caught on the brake shoes. You will need to look on the back side of the backing plate (the steel plate on which the brake components are mounted) for a small rubber plug. Removing this plug will provide access to the brake shoe adjuster. Use a flat head screwdriver or a brake adjuster bar to retract the brake shoes. \n The adjuster is designed to self-adjust the shoes into a tightened position, so loosening them may be tricky. If the drum gets harder to turn as you adjust, you are going in the wrong direction. \n Once the drum is removed you can continue. \n These springs attach to the brake shoe and the shoe anchor and hold tension on the brake shoe. Once the brake pedal is released, they return the brake shoe to its original position. To remove them use the round, notched part of the brake spring pliers. Place the round part on the anchor pin (the nob that the springs are hooked to) and turn it until the notch catches the spring, and then twist and pull to remove the spring., To do this, lightly grip the outside of the retaining ring with pliers, push in, and twist until the ring comes off., At this point the shoe should easily pull away from the backing plate. There will be another spring attached at the bottom of the shoe, but it will no longer be tensioned so you can just slide it off of the shoe. \n One of the brake shoes will be connected to an emergency brake line. To remove it, pull the spring cover back and slide the cable sideways away from the shoe., Fasten the emergency brake cable to the replacement brake shoe on the same side your removed it. Pull up the cover again and slide the cable into the proper slot on the shoe (it will look the same as the one you removed it from). ., You will need to transfer the return spring (at the top of the shoe) and the small emergency brake spring (near the center of the shoe). If your vehicle has any other hardware on the brake shoe, transfer it to the new one as well. ., You want to avoid squeaking and rubbing of the brake shoes. For this reason, you should grease any bare or rubbed spots on the backing plate. ., There will be a hook at the end of the spring and a slot in the bottom of the brake shoe. Hook the spring into that slot. \n Now it is time to put the first brake shoe back into place. Once you get it lined up, hold it there until you can replace the retaining ring. \n Put the spring that goes with the retaining ring in place over the small rod that protrudes from behind the brake shoe. Place the ring over the spring and press in and twist until the ring slides over the rod and locks into place. \n Now it is time to begin installing the second brake shoe. Again, you are going to start with the bottom spring. \n You will need to line it up with the adjusting spring lever. \n Here you will use the flat end of your brake spring pliers to pry the spring into place and hook it at the top of the second brake shoe. This will connect the two brake shoes. \n Follow the same procedure as you did with the first retaining ring. Place the spring first, then push and twist the ring into place. \n This screw changes the position of the adjusting spring, which in turn changes the position of the brake shoes. Since the new shoes are thicker than the old ones, you will need to set the adjusting screw to account for that. Use one screwdriver to push the automatic adjuster assembly down and the other to twist the cog that loosens the adjuster. \n Slide the drum back onto the hub. You will want to spin it and make sure that it has just a little drag. If the drum does not spin then your shoes are too tight and you need to loosen them (using the adjusting screw). If the drum spins freely with no drag at all then your shoes are too loose and you will need to tighten them (using the adjusting screw). \n You may or may not have bolts to fasten your drum to the hub. If you do, they should be reinstalled now. \n You want to tighten the retaining nut that holds the drum in place, and also put the cotter pin back through the hole to keep the nut from loosening. \n The dust cap should push right back into place. Make sure that it is snapped back into place tightly. \n You should slide the wheels back onto the wheelbase and thread the lug nuts on tight enough to hold wheels in place while the car is still on the jack stands. \n Do this slowly and carefully. You do not want the vehicle to drop suddenly. \n Once the weight is back on the wheels, use a lug wrench or impact wrench to tighten the lugs to the proper torque specifications in your service manual. \n You should check your brake fluid and add more if needed anytime you do brake work. \n Before you drive your car you want to be sure that your new brake shoes are working properly. \n 
 A simple way to start is to plan in at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at least three days per week. Do exercises that elevate your heart rate, such as jogging, brisk walking, swimming, or cycling. \n Exercise has multiple benefits for your health, not the least of which is having a positive impact on your blood pressure so that you minimize your chances of having any blood pressure problems during pregnancy. \n Note that, if you are not already active, you should lightly ease into an exercise routine under the supervision of your doctor. Do not begin a new exercise routine suddenly without first consulting your doctor.\n Your doctor can inform you of a body weight that is healthy and normal for someone of your height and build, should you have any questions about it. \n Your doctor can provide you with guidelines as to the weight changes you should aim for as your pregnancy progresses, which will depend on how much you weighed prior to becoming pregnant. \n If you are not yet pregnant, use diet and exercise to get as close to your ideal weight as possible before getting pregnant. \n Losing weight during pregnancy is not recommended. Even overweight pregnant women are expected to gain weight during pregnancy. \n Quitting smoking will also have a noticeable impact on your baby's health and wellbeing. Therefore, not only is it in the best interest of you, but of your future baby as well. \n Your family doctor can help you with strategies to quit smoking, if you are interested. \n Your doctor may offer you nicotine replacement as needed, and/or medications to help diminish cigarette cravings (such as Wellbutrin or Bupropion). \n It can certainly help to keep your blood pressure in a safe and normal range during pregnancy. \n Avoid consuming too much salt or processed foods (which are high in salt); this will help to prevent blood pressure problems during pregnancy. \n Also, opt for healthier foods overall, such as more fruits, vegetables, and whole grain carbohydrates. \n This is better for your blood pressure than unhealthier alternatives such as refined carbohydrates, snack foods and junk food. \n \n Consider seeing a counsellor or psychologist if you have elevated stress levels. They may be able to help you with coping strategies to reduce your stress. \n You may also want to consider activities such as yoga, meditation, or relaxing walks in nature to help calm your state of mind. \n It may also help to share your emotions with close friends and family as you progress through your pregnancy. It can be a challenging nine months and it can help to know that you are not alone. \n A normal blood pressure is below 140/90 (where the top number represents the systolic reading and the bottom number represents the diastolic reading). If your blood pressure is elevated above that point, your doctor will likely advise that you be treated with blood pressure medications to reduce it. \n You can check your blood pressure on your own at a local pharmacy or big box store should you have any reason to feel concerned. \n If not, your doctor will perform regular blood pressure checks at each of your prenatal visits, to ensure that there are no problems. \n Some blood pressure medications are safe during pregnancy, while other are not ideal for pregnant women. \n Blood pressure medications to avoid during pregnancy include any ACE inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, such as Ramipril and Captopril), any ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers such as Candesartan), and any renin inhibitors (such as aliskiren). These drugs may cause birth defects or disease in the fetus. \n Blood pressure medications that are recommended in pregnancy include Methyldopa and Labetalol. Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine are also used frequently. \n The risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy often goes hand in hand with other symptoms, such as protein in your urine; therefore, if you demonstrate high blood pressure, your doctor will do a full evaluation of your health at this time. \n It may require treatment with a blood pressure medication, as well as continued monitoring to ensure that no further problems develop (such as preeclampsia). \n Preeclampsia is dangerous for you and your baby, and needs immediate medical treatment. If left untreated, it can lead to eclampsia, which is the onset of seizures. Potential signs of preeclampsia include: \n Fatigue \n Vision problems \n Severe headaches \n Rapid weight gain due to swelling \n Nausea and vomiting \n Reduced urine \n Abdominal pain \n See your doctor or go to the Emergency Room (if you cannot get a same-day appointment with your family doctor) if you notice the above signs or symptoms. \n Possible complications that may result from high blood pressure during pregnancy that is left untreated include: \n A diminished nutrient supply to the placenta. With high blood pressure, less blood flow gets to the placenta which decreases the nutrient supply for your baby. This can lead to poor growth of the baby. \n Placental abruption. Placental abruption is when the placenta detaches from the uterus wall as a result of the stress from untreated high blood pressure. This is an obstetrical emergency requiring immediate delivery of the baby. \n Premature delivery. Your baby may need to be delivered prematurely if their wellbeing (or your own personal health) is compromised as a result of blood pressure concerns. \n 
 Everyone loves to sleep in in the mornings from time to time. If for whatever reason you're trying to make a day disappear faster, you can shave off some time from it by hitting the snooze button and sleeping in a bit. Sleeping is by and far the most effective way of making time speed up. If you're already in bed and want the morning to disappear, sometimes the best thing to do is nothing at all., A shower is one of the most physically pleasant stages of your day. Most people try to get in an out of the shower in record time, but if you have some time to kill, taking things more slowly can be great. Let the water rush over you; appreciate the warmth and temporary peace. \n Sitting down with a cup of coffee and enjoying yourself at the kitchen table sounds sort of like a cliche at a point where everyone seems to rush from place to place, but slowing down to enjoy yourself strangely makes time feel that much faster. \n There is probably a regular time you like to leave to go to work, school, or wherever else you typically need to be. If this is the case, consider leaving ten or fifteen minutes earlier than usual. Your brain tends to chunk memories into chapters, and leaving early will streamline that particular stage of your day. Unless you're leaving early, you may actually enjoy the extra time you have to prepare at the start of your day., Do something you've been putting off, whether it's an unfinished project or responding to emails. Your goals are already laid out for you, and you'll feel less stressed after you attend to them. \n Being busy is your greatest potential ally when it comes to speeding up time. With that in mind, you should be doing everything you can to immerse yourself in the tasks at hand. \n Work may not be fun per se, but keeping yourself focused will make the day go by faster. \n New projects are always on the go, and the slowest periods of work are perfect to latch onto something new. New projects can actually be a lot of fun at first to organize. Look around yourself at work; there's got to be something that could be done to improve your work environment. \n Teaming up with someone can add a pleasant social aspect to the experience, if you're extroverted and enjoy interacting with co-workers. \n If you can't start something on your own accord, ask your superior for something new to do. Being kept busy will make the hours fly past, and you'll also be thought of as a hard worker who shows initiative without being asked. \n Listening to music will keep you at least slightly entertained while you work, saving you from total boredom while you work. \n If work is painfully slow and you're having a really hard time making the time pass, going for frequent breaks will give you ample time to relax and let your perception of time regulate itself. Go have a coffee. Go to the bathroom and relieve yourself. While these activities are unproductive and relying on them too heavily will have the opposite effect you're looking for. \n Frequent breaks make a distraction from work, but when it comes to passing time, the biggest benefit will be the relaxation it brings you. Of course, this won't have such a great effect if you're worried about falling behind in work. \n People willingly lose hours of their life checking up on the lives of others, and most of the time, they're not even trying to burn time. Social media is a great tool to speed up time while you're at work. You don't want to make an overly frequent habit of it however, as it may compromise your work situation. \n As a rule, relying too heavily on distractions at work can make the day feel slower. Ultimately, the best way to get through work as seemingly fast as possible is to immerse yourself in tasks. \n Naps are good ways to kill some time if you're bored and could use the shuteye. If you really have nothing better to do, sleep will give your body some precious time to heal itself and patch up. Going to sleep in the middle of the day may be harder than at night or if you're already in bed in the morning, but it is the fastest way you can go about speeding up time if your body will allow you. \n Not to mention, when you wake up, you may feel more motivated to be productive and let the day come to you as it will. \n Getting lost in leisurely activities is a brilliant way to speed up time, as we're never really considering how long we've been doing something when we're having a lot of fun. Reading one of your favourite books will take your mind off the passage of time, possibly even to the point where you'll wish there had been more hours in the day to fit in more reading. \n The choice of book is very important in this case. A boring or poorly written book will actually have the opposite effect you're looking for. \n So-called 'binge watching' takes up an exorbitant amount of time, and shows like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad are all too eager to eat up whatever time you'll allot to them. If you have a spare day you want to see over quickly, put on a show and let yourself relax. If it's a show you really like, you'll probably lose track of how much time has really gone by. \n If you've got expertise in something, you may be a candidate to write a wikiHow article! Writing a step-by-step guide on a subject you're fascinated by can be a lot of fun, and like any writing project, you'll find the time slips away like nothing once you get into the thick of planning and realizing your article.If you're not the writing type, you could find a how-to article on any random subject that interests you and learn a new skill. Learning is a great way to pass time, as your mind will become too occupied to worry about what time it is. \n There's nothing like curling up to watch a movie at the end of an overly long day. Unless a movie is dreadfully boring or their bladders are tempting them elsewhere, people aren't usually thinking of the time while they're watching a movie. Instead, they're immersed in what's on the screen. Watching one of your favourite movies during or after dinner can be an incredibly rewarding experience. \n Curling up somewhere comfortable like a bed or sofa is a must in this case. If your body's relaxed, you'll have an easier time letting the time slip you by. \n When you're learning something new, time seems to speed up. This is because the mind is too occupied with the fresh tasks to be as concerned with the passage of time. Your stomach will thank you for the new experience, and if you like the recipe enough, you can use it again on future occasions. \n On the other hand, some studies have actually found that time speeds up when you're doing things that you're already very familiar with. This would include recipes. The bottom line is that you want to be engaging with something., Sleep is the best way to accelerate time. No one is keeping track of the passage of time when they're dozing away. Getting a head start on your sleep will give you a big boost for the coming day, which may be a good thing if your current day hasn't been great. \n People who are looking to make their days go by faster typically fall into one of two categories. The first group wants time to go by in anticipation of some upcoming event. The second are merely bored and cannot decide on how to effectively use their time. If you're trying to speed up the day due to a legitimate stressor, it is understandable and possibly worth doing. If you're bored, you're probably wanting time to speed up only because you're not engaged by anything at the moment. \n If you end up finding something that interests you (possibly even from the suggestions in this article!) you'll probably stop caring about wanting the day to speed up. \n In contrast, if you're trying to do something you're very familiar with will have the opposite effect. Routine is your friend. Your mind will speed up time and run on autopilot if you're regaling yourself with the familiar. \n Speeding up your perception of time can only be approached indirectly.It ultimately doesn't matter whether you're doing something new or familiar, or even who you're doing it with; the passage of time ultimately depends on how busy you are. If you are occupied with something, no matter how trivial it may seem, you won't be thinking of the time. \n To combat this, just make sure you're relaxed and feeling relatively decent. This will make it easier to focus on activities as well. \n This includes seeing to things like solving headaches or migraines. A migraine can make even an enjoyable experience feel like a test of endurance. \n Ultimately, the way you can speed up the impression of time in your head is to ignore the passage of time. Looking at a clock will remind you exactly how much time has passed, making you more aware of it generally. If you are dead set on speeding up your day as much as possible, you should make a point of avoiding any clocks. Don't even think about how much time has passed. \n 
 It may be easy to perform but there is not much challenge, and you will probably eventually find other work to do. \n Your spirit may or may not be engaged by a job. \n It may provide more challenge, but after a while, if you get burned out, you may stop doing it. \n If it does not that is a job. If it does that is potentially your life's work! \n There is plenty of challenge and personal meaning if it fully engages you. You will always want to do it--if it is your life's work. It definitely fully engages your spirit. \n \n Move into a management "position" to learn management and supervision skills. \n Quit and use the skills you learned to finally: \n Create the spiritually engaged work: call it your Your Life’s Work as an independent contractor training others in customer service skills--if it fully engages you. \n\n How much spirit is involved. \n \n Having opportunity to really express who you actually are \n Desiring to be surrounded by or create beauty \n Living in freedom--to do it your own way \n Discovering skills and talents you never knew you had \n Experiencing butterflies or being scared sometimes \n Finding your desired “right things”--right for your spirit \n Feeling “turned on,” lit up, excited, enthusiastic \n No longer wanting to settle for ordinary or mediocre \n Finding positive change and newness in your work \n Broadening your perspective, seeing more of the big picture \n Shifting to wanting to learn more in your work, be more, and do more \n Relying more on intuition to make life decisions. \n
 Some people have difficulty running first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, and others thrive on 5 am runs. Find the time of day that works best for your body and gradually add distance and speed.\n Make a playlist that has varied music that can help you know when to speed up and when to jog. Interval training that transitions between fast sprints and recovery jogs helps to build speed over time. Mix a few of your favorite techno or hard rock songs in with some hip hop or country and create a pump-up mix that will get your legs moving in no time. \n If you've always listened to music while exercising, try ditching the iPod for awhile and see how that makes your body feel. \n Some people can increase their running distance by not being restricted by the length or tempo of their playlist. \n Running without music allows you to focus on your breath and listen to the sound of your body working. \n Put on a running outfit that makes you feel energized and swift. While some people actually enjoy the heavy feel of a sweatshirt that makes them sweat it out, others prefer lightweight shorts and sweat-reducing material. Wear the clothing that you feel most comfortable in. \n Running shoes come in very specific fits that are tailored to the length and width of your foot and are made for specific types of running. You can injure your feet by wearing improper footwear, so make sure to get your feet fitted by a specialist. \n Road running shoes should be worn on concrete and other hard, man-made surfaces. \n Trail running shoes should be worn for off-road running on dirt trails, sandy beaches, and rocky or muddy paths. \n Know if you have a high-arch, a normal arch, or a flat foot. The arch of your foot will determine how your foot moves as you run. \n If your foot hits the ground equally, choose a neutral shoe. If you over-pronate your foot by rolling inward too much, choose a shoe for stability or motion control. If you supinate your foot by rolling outward too much, choose a shoe with a lot of cushioning and flexibility., Slowly jog half of a mile before stretching. Doing so allows you to warm up your joints and muscles before you stretch them, thus preventing injury. Be sure to perform dynamic stretches that include motion such as: \n Leg lifts. Swing one leg out to the side as far as you can swing it, and then swing it back across your body in front of your standing leg, as far as possible. Repeat this stretch ten times on each leg. \n Cheerleader Kicks. Keep your back and knees straight, and walking forward, lift your legs straight out in front in an exaggerated march, and flex your toes towards you. \n Butt kicks. Perform an exaggerated running-in-place motion while standing to loosen up your knees, hamstrings, and quads. \n Walking lunges. Squat into a wide lunge with one foot dramatically out in front of the other, and continue to switch between legs as you slowly progress forward. \n Shoulder stretches. Don't forget to stretch your torso and shoulders to prevent cramping during your run. You use your arms to propel you forward when you sprint, so you'll need to be loose and limber. Pull one arm straight across your chest and hug it in with the forearm of your other arm. Switch sides and stretch the other arm. \n Use a stopwatch to log yourself for various mileages in order to track your progress. \n Incorporate hills into your runs two to three times per week to push your boundaries and condition your body. Try following this example weekly routine: \n Day 1: 10-20-10. Jog for 10 minutes, run briskly for 20 minutes (80% effort), and then jog for another 10 minutes. \n Day 2: Sprint training. Head to a track and practice sprints. Jog 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km), then run another mile, sprinting the straightaways and jogging the turns. Start out with just the mile and a half, and gradually increase your distance. \n Day 3: Rest. \n Day 4: Long 60-90 minute run. Run at a pace that is comfortable enough to keep going. \n Day 5: 10-20-10. Jog for 10 minutes, run briskly for 20 minutes (80% effort), and then jog for another 10 minutes. \n Day 6: Rest. \n Day 7: Sprint training. Head to a track and practice sprints. Jog 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km), then run another mile, sprinting the straightaways and jogging the turns. Start out with just the mile and a half, and gradually increase your distance. \n Being patient with yourself is one of the most important aspects of building endurance. Avoid pushing yourself to run too far until you have become comfortable with a gradual distance increase. Basically, don't try to run six miles right off the bat. Start out with one mile, then build up to a mile and a half, then two miles, etc. \n Don't try to sprint out a five-mile run, you'll exhaust (and maybe even injure) yourself. Start off with a light jog and gradually build up your speed as you run. \n Your breath can have a huge impact on your ability to run long distances. Make sure you are breathing in and out of your nose, or in through your nose and out through your mouth, depending on your preference. A steady breath means a steady heart rate and a higher lung capacity. \n You want to run with the same poise that you walk. Don't hunch or bend your back as you run, keep your spine as straight as possible. \n Plantar flexion occurs when you push off the ground by flexing your ankle joint. Dorsiflexion is the process of pulling your knee up off of the ground at a 90-degree angle. This reloads your ankle for forward push-off. \n The hip flexor and lower back must flex as you run to hold your back straight and support forward motion. Make sure you are cycling the legs forward, not recovering the legs behind your body. \n As you run, alternate driving your elbows back and forward in an exaggerated motion. As your elbow drives back, your opposite knee should lift up. Your elbows should also be bent at about 90-degree angles. \n The longer your stride, the more effective your forward motions will be. To create longer strides, use your legs to push rather than pull you forward. This means the bulk of the power when you run should come from whichever leg is behind during the push-off. \n Once you have the basic technique down, you can begin to decrease the interval between each stride, meaning you will pick up the pace and run faster. Try not to compromise your stride length as you increase your speed. \n To develop speed over long distances, first incorporate intervals of 30-second or one-minute sprints into your runs. \n Make sure to drink the recommended 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of fluid for men and 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of fluid for women per day.For runs over an hour long, you will need to drink water during your run. \n Drink water up to two hours before a long run. During the run, sip water in small sips and frequently to avoid bloating or cramping. \n After a long run, drink 500mL of water immediately, and then continue to sip water throughout the day to replenish your water supply., You can get lean protein from fish, chicken, turkey, tofu, eggs, and beans, just to name a few. \n Salmon is one of the best sources of Omega-3 beneficial fats, which promote a healthy inflammation response. An increase in Omega-3's in your diet may also help reduce the symptoms of asthma. \n One egg a day will give you 30% your daily value of Vitamin K, which promotes healthy bones. In addition, eggs contain all of the essential amino acids that aid in muscle recovery. After a long run, your body will thank you for replenishing your store of amino acids. \n Avoid a diet high in red meat or processed meat. Both are thought to increase the risk of colorectal cancer, heighten bad cholesterol levels, and contribute to clogged arteries and a higher risk of heart attack. \n Nuts, especially almonds, are high in Vitamin E antioxidants and Omega-3 fatty acids that can help lower bad cholesterol levels in the body. Vitamin E also protects body tissue from potential damage from free radicals. Be aware that nuts are high in fat, so only consume the recommended serving size daily., Dark greens and berries are packed full of healthy antioxidants and greens are extremely rich in fiber, which promotes digestive regularity. Foods like sweet potatoes and carrots are rich in beta-carotene, a healthy antioxidant that promotes muscle recovery. \n When purchasing cereal, bread, crackers, and other carbohydrate-based foods, choose the whole grain or whole wheat option. Whole grains contain fiber and phytonutrients that support healthy digestion. \n Potassium decreases the likelihood that you will develop cramps while you run, helps keep you hydrated, and speeds up muscle recovery. Good sources of potassium include bananas, milk, yogurt, and potatoes., If you aren't getting enough Vitamin C from your diet, consider taking a Vitamin C supplement or multivitamin daily.
 To make it easier for him, hang something from the handle of the refrigerator door. A rope with a thick knot on the end works particularly well for this, but a towel will work too. Just make sure it is properly secured to the handle. \n If you decide to use an old rope or towel (i.e., something you don't mind ruining), check the integrity of the threads. If strands come off or it rips with little effort, find something newer. The fibers and dust will distract your dog and may be harmful to his health.\n Hanging a towel or rope won't usually inspire your dog to start opening the door. If you are lucky, he will at least investigate the new door accessory. If you want to draw his attention to the towel or rope, point at it with your finger. When he pays the towel or rope any attention, click your and give him a reward. \n First, click and reward when he looks at the towel or rope. Second, make him touch the rope with their nose before clicking and rewarding. This is the first part of shaping your dog's behavior into the acceptable form. \n Once he knows paying attention to the towel or rope is an avenue for rewards he will expect them. Now, you want to start training your dog to open the door on command. While standing near the refrigerator (i.e., close enough to point and touch the towel or rope), use a command such as "Open the fridge". Click and reward when he successfully bites the towel or rope. \n Your dog may not initially understand the new command. He has been getting rewards without it so far. First, click and reward when he touches the towel or rope. Second, stop clicking and rewarding for just touching the rope. He will get aggravated and naturally bite the rope. Any motion to bite the rope should get a click and reward (e.g., touching it with his teeth or licking it). Don't move on until he actually bites the rope or towel. \n Stop providing clicks and rewards for simply biting the rope. Make him hold or pull on the rope next. Taper your clicks and rewards so that he must pull harder and harder to get rewarded. \n Train your dog to pull harder and harder on the rope. Start holding off clicking and rewarding until he pulls so hard the door opens. Click and reward if the door even opens a little and closes again. Continue clicking and rewarding until he opens the door all the way. \n This can be difficult if your dog is pulling in the wrong direction. If you notice this is happening, stand in your dog's way so that he will have to move in a direction that causes the door to open. Once he starts associating the door opening with a reward he will not need to be guided. \n Continue using the command throughout the process. When your dog opens the door all the way and it stays open, reward your dog excessively. Keep practicing this exercise until the dog will open the door on command. Eventually, he will become much more proficient at the task. \n Glass bottles will work too, but cans will not shatter when dropped. Your dog will be carrying the can sideways. Some beers may provide you options with cans. If you have a smaller dog you may opt to choose a tall can that has a smaller diameter. However, your beer of choice may not be packaged in these bottle-shaped aluminum cans. \n You want to get the beer cold for now. Your dog may not be accustomed to the temperature of the cold can. If you use a lukewarm to train with, your dog may become distracted by the coldness of the can when attempting to grab the beer from the refrigerator. \n This training can take some time. There's no need to defrost your refrigerator and freezer during training. Use a cold beer placed on the floor during this exercise. You may want to stick with a carpeted floor at the beginning. If he immediately picks up a can and drops it, then the damage to the can will be minimal. \n Click and reward when your dog looks at the can. Then click and reward when he investigates the can. Anything that gets him closer to biting or picking up the can. With luck, a can in the middle of the room will be very attention-getting. He may naturally investigate. \n As your dog investigates the can, he may engage in a number of behaviors. Any behavior that is closer to biting and picking up the can should receive a click and a reward. He may first sniff. Then he may lick. Then he may try to bite the can to carry it to another spot for more comfortable licking. \n Your dog may start licking the can profusely. It is cold, and licking the can will provide a very novel experience for him. If he starts doing nothing but lick the can, stop rewarding him for licking the can. \n If it takes a while to get your dog to bite the can, replace the can with a cold one from the refrigerator. This way he is biting and picking up a cold can instead of a lukewarm one. \n If you have a "pick it up" command typically used with a ball, use that command to teach the dog to pick up the beer can. \n Start using a command such as "Bring me a beer" to encourage the on-command behavior. If your dog does bite the can it may be for the purpose of carrying it off for himself. Be sure to have some favorite treats ready to give him when he picks up the can and brings it to you. If the cold can, in and of itself, is a treat to your dog, you will need to find a treat he likes a lot more. Reward him for picking up the can, and, later, for bringing the can to you and releasing it into your hand. \n If you regularly play fetch with your dog, use the same command to get him to bring the can to you. \n This is where carpet comes in handy. If he has trouble picking up the can or drops it when a reward is presented, the can will fall softly on the carpet. \n If your dog is reluctant to release the can, consider bring the treat closer to his mouth. He will have to release the can to receive the treat. \n Consider having your dog pick up the can first, while the can is lying on its side, and second, while the can is standing up normally. Most likely the beers will be sitting upright in the refrigerator, so that's the orientation your dog needs to be accustomed to. \n If your dog fetches your beer but drops it in front of you, do not reward him. Repeat the command and point to the beer in front of you. Reward him only when he puts the beer in your hand or you can expect a lot of shaken-up beers in the future. \n Once you know he will pick up and bring you a cold can of beer on command its time to move to the real deal. Open the refrigerator door to reveal a low shelf of beers. Put your cans near the bottom where your dog can get to him.Leave enough space so that your dog can reach in with his snout and grab a beer. \n The fact that the beer is in the refrigerator and not the floor will not be lost on your dog. This is a completely new scenario. Your goal is to activate the same behavior as before but within the new setting. Pointing will help focus your dog's attention, while giving the command will activate the instinct to perform the associated reward-seeking behavior. \n Click and reward for anything resembling the original behavior. Your goal is to get him to grab the beer from the fridge, and bring it to you. Ignore the fact that he neither opened nor closed the door. You will work on the proper sequence of behaviors later. \n Teaching your dog to close the refrigerator door works best when he already knows how to close a door. Primarily because you don't want to leave your refrigerator door open for an extended period of time. Choose a door that the dog can easily move behind when the door is opened. \n This can be difficult because he is not doing anything specific. Try putting a treat between your fingers. Then put the treat in front of their face. Without releasing the treat, move your hand toward the spot you want your dog to be (i.e., behind the door). When your dog gets behind the door, release the treat. \n If you already have a command for your dog to sit on a specific spot or on or near an item or blanket, use that to get your dog to move behind the door. Place the item he sits close to or on behind the door, and use the proper command. \n Hold a treat above your dog's head. He will likely try to stand up to get it. Lift your hand higher to get him to stand up more. When he is standing up, click the clicker and give him the reward. If you can get him to stand up and remain balanced, then he is doing well. This is not required though. He just needs to be up high enough so he can push the door closed. \n Once your dog is trying to get the treat in the air, move your hand closer and closer to the door. Don't touch the door yourself. Wait for your dog to touch the door. Click and reward as soon as your dog makes any contact with the door. When he looks at the door and hit it then look at you for the treat, that's when you know you are ready to move forward. \n This may be difficult if he does not want to touch the door. Try positioning the treat at the very edge of the door so that he almost have to touch the door to get it. If he moves around the door to avoid touching the door, position yourself perpendicular to the edge of the door (i.e., as if you are the door frame) so your dog will have to touch either you or the door to get to the treat. \n This is really where the clicker is helpful. He may have so much tunnel vision he doesn't notice he touched the door while getting the treat. The clicker should help clue him in that touching the door is what you want him to do. \n Start giving him a specific command such as "Close the door". Gradually encourage him to push the door harder and harder. Let him get the door all the way to the door frame. Keep clicking and rewarding as he gets closer and closer to causing the door to close completely. Start clicking and rewarding only when he shuts the door. \n Now it’s time to move to the last subtask. Just as you taught your dog to close a door, you now need to teach him to close the refrigerator door. This time you will want to change the verbal command. Instead of "close the door", try "close the fridge". This way he knows exactly which door to close even if you are in another room. \n Start with the original command to see if he will understand. If he does, click and reward him. Then move to the new command. If he does not understand, use the same technique you used to teach him to close a door to close the refrigerator door. \n Continue clicking and rewarding when he touches, pushes, or closes the door. If he closes the door once, you are not yet finished. You want him to hear the command, look at the door, close it, and then look back at you for his treat. Re-open the door each time he closes it and repeat. \n First have him obey the command while you stand in front of the refrigerator. Then move farther away so he has to walk to the refrigerator to obey the command. Keep moving farther from the refrigerator until you are in a different room and out of eyesight of the refrigerator. \n This time you want to do the same thing with the second command. Open the refrigerator. While standing in front of the refrigerator, give the "Bring me a beer" command. Click and reward when he completes the task. Then repeat the task as you move farther and farther and into a different room. \n This last one is important. Although your dog may be able to put together that he has to open the refrigerator to get a beer, he will likely not remember to then go back and close the refrigerator. Practice having him complete this task just as you did with the previous tasks. Just don't forget to re-open the refrigerator each time he closes it. \n While standing near the refrigerator, give your dog each command in sequence. First "Open the fridge", then "Bring me a beer", then "Close the fridge". At first, reward him for each task completed. Then start rewarding him only when he finishes the last task. Keep giving the commands as you move into a different room. \n The final task is to train your dog to complete the "Bring me a beer" task without needing to provide the "Open the fridge" command. Stand in front of the refrigerator and give the "Bring me a beer" command. If you are lucky, he will almost immediately pulls the refrigerator open to get to the beers. If not, don't use the "Open the fridge" command. Instead, keep using the "Bring me a beer" command but train him to open the door first just as if the pulling the rope was the first part of the "Bring me a beer" command. \n Training your dog to close the refrigerator in the middle of the second task may be very confusing for your dog. If you insist that this is necessary, you will want to start training your dog to first pick up a beer, then close a door, and then bring the beer to you. You may find it is easier to give the "Bring me a beer" command and follow with a "Now close the fridge". \n 
 The goal here is to remove any foreign particles in the pores of the substrate and also to remove any loose concrete. \n It is important to use a plastic sprayer as the muriatic acid will corrode metal sprayers., You should hear a light fizzle after you have applied it., The acid then ammonia wash will neutralize the ph of the concrete and also open the capillaries of the surface., Be sure to remove any puddles before apply base coat. All tool joints and expansion joints must be honer. Failing to do so may result in cracks showing on the surface some time in the future. \n It is important that the first base coat is entirely dry before proceeding to this step. Once the base coat is dry you will wet the surface and apply the bond coat in the same manner as you applied the base coat. \n This should spread to approximately 9 to 10 m2. Use a trowel to fix the edges and a magic trowel or squeegee on a pole to fix the gauge rake application lines. \n The Texture-Pave now needs to begin to cure. The amount of time this takes depends on the environmental conditions on the day, this can be anywhere from 15 minutes to 45 minutes. You can test the hardness by very lightly placing your thumb into the Texture pave no more than a few millimetres. If you can leave a mark and barley any sand sticks to your thumb you can proceed to the next step. \n Step on the textured concrete stamps and be sure to place your feet over every cm but do not stand on the edges of the stamps. Once the surface has been stamped, slowly peel off the textures concrete stamps and move to the next unstamped area and repeat this step. A smaller touch-up skin can be used on the edges., Wearing eye protection, use a small hand grinder to score the surface with the desired lines or patterns. You do not need to go deep., 1 liter (0.3 US gal) should cover approximately 3.8 m2 per litre., The sealer should have at least two coats with the second being thicker then the first.
 Consider the type of content you want to share with the world, then choose a name that embodies that theme. Having an Instagram name that reflects your personality is a great way to attract followers who share your interests. \n If you are having problems picking an Instagram name, try the name generator at spinxo.com/instagram-names. \n Don't be afraid to use underscores (_) or other symbols. They will often improve an Instagram name by making it easier to read. However, try to keep the symbols to 1 or 2, so someone can search for you by name.\n If possible, make it a creative photo of yourself (instead of an object) so that people can put your face to the name. If you want to be famous, you should not mind putting a few personal things on Instagram. \n Consider a hobby, fascination, or desired aesthetic, and aim to keep your Instagram content within that theme. Add engaging information about your theme to your Profile page, and be sure to post relevant captions when uploading new photos and videos. \n Are you a foodie? Then focus on food-related photos. \n Are you a fashion junkie? Focus on colors, styles, and trends. \n Do you like a certain game or book series? Take creative photos of it and post it on Instagram! \n Are you into a celebrity at the moment? Make your Instagram profile all about that person! You can also find other fans of that celebrity and make a community of your own. \n Do you love role playing? Instagram is a great place to do so. Role play as your favorite character and join other role play communities as well! For example, if you love Naruto, you can roleplay as him or other Naruto characters! \n What can you share with the world that nobody else is doing? Keeping your Instagram account unique ensures that your followers stick around---they won’t be able to find your content anywhere else! \n Become a pro by taking different types of photos and using the filters. Notice the different ways filters can enhance dim lighting or increase the depth of certain colors. You may need to preview your photo in all of the available filters before finding the right one. \n Having uniform colors and effects on most of your photos is a great way to develop an aesthetic. Using too many different filters could make your profile look tacky. See the hashtag “#nofilter” for examples. \n Some Instagram users choose never to use filters as a way to highlight the natural beauty of their photos. \n Instagram’s built-in filters are cool but somewhat limited. There are additional apps that can add even more depth to your content. Install a well-reviewed photo editor from the app store and breathe new life into your feed.Try Instagram’s Boomerang to make short, engaging stop-motion videos. \n Also try Layout, which allows you to combine multiple photos in a single collage-style image. \n Try VSCO Cam, Prisma, Aviary, or Snapseed for high-quality photo editing. \n You won’t always get a great shot the first time, so take several photos and choose the best one. Only post the best, most creative photos that will keep your followers interested and engaged. \n As with traditional photography, Instagram photography has an element of "practice makes perfect." You can only improve by using the app regularly and trying new things. \n Experiment and get creative with your photos. Try new angles, color combinations, and subjects in a variety of interesting settings. \n Use your Instagram account to create a story that is creative, original, and honest. Add “cliffhangers” to your photos to keep fans coming back for more. \n For example, document your travels to a new place, the countdown to a significant event, or your journey with a new pet. \n Spend more time making an individual photo exceptional instead of sharing several that are mediocre. \n Captions can be humorous or sincere. Be playful, but informative. \n Inspired by Snapchat, Instagram now allows users to post photos and videos that disappear in 24 hours. Stories will not be stored in your Instagram feed, so use this feature to share all of the things that don’t quite fit with the rest of your account. Your stories will appear at the top of your followers’ feeds., Pay attention to what is trending and use hashtags on all of your photos. Many Instagram users search for hashtags to find new users to follow—using the right hashtags ensures that people who are looking for your sort of content are able to find you.For example, someone who posts photos from hiking adventures in the Pacific Northwest may use tags like #hiking, #method, #exploregon, #camping, and #mtranier. \n Someone who shares their illustrations may use the hashtags #illustrators, #artistsofinstagram, #penandink, and #womanartists. \n Some popular hashtags are #nofilter (unfiltered photos), #flawless (when you’re looking your best), #nochill (when life gets crazy), and #tbt (Throwback Thursday, a day when Instagrammers post old photos). \n Find Instagram users whose photos you enjoy and add them to your Follow list. Try to comment and like photos every time you go onto Instagram. It is very hard to become popular on Instagram without interacting with and trading likes with others. \n You most likely have a set number of friends who would be willing to follow you. Follow your Facebook friends on Instagram and they will surely follow back., When posting a new photo, tap your preferred social media option under “Share” and enter your username and password. This will post your Instagram photo, giving your followers on other platforms the chance to follow you on Instagram. \n While sharing some Instagram photos on Facebook or your blog can attract new followers, keep some content exclusive to Instagram. Remind your Facebook or blog followers that they should follow your Instagram for different photos. Let your Instagram account be where people can get to know another side of you. \n If you post something funny, caption it with something like, “Tag three friends who would think this is funny.” When people tag their friends on your photos, their friends will view your photo and usually like it or start following you. \n Geotagging adds a location link to the top of your Instagram photos, allowing people to see where you were and view other photos taken at that location. This is an excellent way to attract new followers, but remember that geotags share your location with the entire world. Avoid geotagging when you are home or anywhere else that you don’t want to be found in person. \n According to the analytics firm Union Metrics, brands that decrease the frequency of their posts tend to lose followers quickly.Your followers followed you because they want to see your content. Be consistent with posting, but don’t overdo it. \n If you post more than 2-3 photos or videos per day, use Instagram Stories so you don’t clutter your followers’ feeds. \n When posting photos, add a caption that contains a question for your followers. Make the question something thoughtful, or something funny. The more people that answer your question, the more popular your post will be. \n To respond to them directly, type the “@” symbol and type their Instagram name. This shows everyone that you’re down to earth and willing to interact with your fans. \n According to an Instagram study, posts that mentioned another Instagram account (e.g., @instagram) in the caption encouraged 56% more comments and likes than otherwise.For example, if you take a photo at a restaurant, mention the restaurant’s Instagram name (e.g., @olivegarden) in the caption. \n If you see something that reminds you of another Instagram user, snap a photo and post it with a caption like, “I thought of you, @!” \n Unless you are already a celebrity, you need to put time and energy into becoming an Instagram sensation. Increase your responses to comments, respond to Direct Messages, and like tons of photos! \n If you have a creative idea and some fans, grow your community by giving away a prize in exchange for likes and follows. Choose a prize worth winning, share a photo of it on Instagram, and then encourage your followers to like the photo to enter. When the contest ends, choose a random follower to win the prize! \n Encourage your followers to tag their friends so they can also enter your contest. \n Websites like Statigram, Websta.me, and Iconosquare provide statistics that help you track your Instagram success. If you find that you lost several followers over a particular period, look back at your feed and see what may have sent them running. If your views spiked when you shared a certain photo, share more like it. \n 
 It's free in the Windows 10 app store; you can find it listed under the name "Easy Movie Maker".While you can technically download the classic "Windows Movie Maker", Microsoft no longer supports it.\n Your dedicated "Pictures" folder is a good place to start if you don't have any ideas. \n If you don't want to move the actual music file (e.g., MP3), simply copy and paste the file. \n This will create a new, empty folder on your desktop. \n This will make retrieving these files whilst creating your slideshow a quick and efficient process.

 Remove all clocks from your work area!\n Focus on your breathing and allow your mind to "drift". Hold on to no thoughts and allow any troubling or worrisome thoughts to pass though your mind - but do not give them any energy. \n Instead of dreading the tasks that lie ahead recall pleasant memories of loved ones in the room that you are cleaning. This will make your job so much more enjoyable while you are tidying up the messes made by others who live with you. \n bathroom, kitchen, etc. Really look at the items you find and try to recall where it came from. If it was a gift say thanks in your mind to the person who gave it! \n \n Keep feet flat on the floor reaching as high as you can without going on your toes. Your may gently move onto your toes if you cannot reach an area after you have stretched to your capacity while standing flat footed. Pretend that you are a small child stretching for the first time without straining. Move as if it is the first time you have moved, focusing on feeling fully alive. You should begin to awaken muscles that may have been strained in the past and are stiff. Continue to breathe in a relaxed manner and allow the air gently in through your nose and exhale slowly out your mouth. \n \n Sweep or vacuum the center of the room. You will be repeating this later so just get the majority of dirt for now. \n Move furniture to the center of the room. Do not move heavy furniture with haste! Stick your rear out as far as you can and use some butt power! So many people fail to fully use the largest muscle in the human body--the gluteus maximus! Do not forget to keep breathing! When dragging a large or heavy item lead with your rear. Do not keep you back hunched and have your shoulders back as far as possible. \n Begin wiping wood trim with a damp rag in any corner. See how far you can bend without straining as you wipe dust from woodwork. Continue around the room until you have dusted all of the trim. \n Sweep and damp mop or vacuum the areas normally covered by furniture. Pretend that it is the first time you have done these tasks and focus on the way you are moving. Reach only as far as you can with the broom, mop, or vacuum using your arms. Keep your torso standing straight and move your feet if you need to reach farther than your arms will allow. When bending to sweep dust into the dustpan, allow your butt as high into the air as it is able to go. Focus on feeling a stretch in your hamstrings. Allow your knees to bend slightly if this is more comfortable. \n Move furniture back into place using the butt method with breathing relaxed. Now you can thoroughly sweep and damp mop or vacuum the center of the room using the methods previously described. \n This will make the cleaning more enjoyable and entertaining. \n Cleaning regularly prevents the build-up of cleaning that becomes even more complicated and burdensome to tackle. \n Refer to the list whenever at a point of confusion over what to do next. This keeps the energy flowing and the cleaning in action. \n Have a special dinner with music and candles for the entire family, or go and lie down and read or do some other enjoyable activity for a set period of time. \n Practice singing your favorite song while cleaning, even if you do not know how to sing. It could brighten your spirits and make cleaning less burdensome. \n Even if you have a run-down home, investing into some creative ideas might bring out a beauty in your home that makes you enjoy being under its roof. Color and decoration can add to the experience of being at home, making it like an escape. \n You can transform your home and emotional sense of well-being by making your living environment comfortable and clean. \n Throw out, or better yet, donate to charity, old clothing items and goods that you no longer use or need. Compartmentalize items in your home into storage boxes and keep them out of sight. \n These make cleaning even more of an enjoyable experience. \n When you have all of your cleaning supplies together in one place, cleaning becomes a much more efficient task to undertake. \n You can buy new dish rags or simply cut up old material into squares and store them under the sink for dish washing purposes. \n 
 You can wear pretty much anything, but vintage and skate-brand shirts are the most popular among skaters. You can wear a faded t-shirt, a fitted shirt, or even a tank top. Consider wearing a fitted top if you are wearing baggy pants. \n Consider going vintage. This doesn't mean that you have to wear clothes that are ripped or torn. Instead, try going to a second-hand store and picking up some vintage t-shirts from the 80s and 90s.They don't even have to be skateboard-related. Many skaters also like to wear vintage cartoon shirts as well.\n Even if you are posing as one, you may want to look as though you actually skateboard. Skateboarding requires a lot of leg moment, so you'll want something that is easy to move in. Here are some popular options for you:Baggy leans are the most popular choice amongst skaters. \n Loose-fitting cargos are another popular choice. They are tomboyish, and the extra pockets are great for storing things, such as music players. \n Capris are another popular choice, especially if they are loose fitting and baggy. Think guy shorts. \n Avoid wearing anything that is too ripped or torn looking. It will just look messy. \n Skater girls will wear what is easiest for them to skate in. You might find that baggy clothes aren't all that comfortable, and that skinny jeans are the easiest for you to move around in.Shorts are popular, especially in the summer. Many skater girls find high-waist shorts to be very comfortable. If you are learning how to skate, however, you might want to wear some kneepads in case you fall. \n Leggings are easy to move in, but they tear easily too. If you are just learning how to skate, you might want to hold off on the leggings to avoid ruining a nice pair. \n Skirts may look cute, but they are not always practical either. If you choose to wear a skirt, you might want to wear some leggings or biker shorts underneath them to prevent any embarrassing incidents. \n Skinny jeans can look great, but they can be difficult to move around in. If you want to wear skinny jeans, make sure that you can bend down and touch your board easily. If your jeans are too tight, you might not be able to perform any tricks., You can sneakers that have a flat bottom and a good grip. Canvas shoes (high-tops are especially popular) are also a great choice, but keep in mind that they wear out quickly. Most skater girls will pass on the ballet flats and heels because its difficult (and sometimes dangerous) to skate while wearing them.Try changing out the laces in your shoes for bright-colored ones. This is a great way to show off your personality. \n If you have canvas shoes, try drawings some cool designs on them using a fabric marker. You can also doodle on the toe area using a permanent marker. \n The skater look is all about layering, and a jacket thrown over a shirt can complete the look. A long-sleeved, plaid, flannel shirt can look especially chic when layered over a plain shirt or tied around the waist. When choosing jackets, try not to get anything too form-fitting; you want to be able to move your arms in order to perform tricks on your board. \n Most skater girls like to keep things simple and laid-back. Besides, long, dangling earrings and necklaces will only get in the way while skating. If you want to wear some jewelry, here are some things for you to try: \n Wristbands often come with stamped, printed, or engraved words and phrases. They are a great way to show your individuality. \n Sweatbands are comfortable to wear, and are often embroidered with a brand logo. They are a great way to show your support and enthusiasm for your favorite brands and companies. \n Studded bracelets are like mini versions of studded belts. You can find them in shops that sell punk attire. \n They not only keep the sun off your head, but can also keep long hair out of your face. Try finding one that has a logo of your favorite brand. If you can't find one, then get a plain one, and decorate it with a patch or pin. This is a great way to show support for your favorite brands. \n If you'd like to show off your punk side, you can always put on a pair of fingerless gloves. They'll also help protect your palms in case you fall. If you can't find any, you can make your own by getting a pair of leather gloves and snipping the fingers off at the first knuckle. \n Baggy pants can be easy to move in, but if they are so baggy that they are sliding off your waist, you might want to use a belt to keep them up. A studded belt would be a great touch. You can get a standard belt with silver studs, or you can get a belt with colored studs. \n When you aren't listening to music, let the headphones hang around your neck. \n If you use earbuds, then you might want to roll them up and put them away so that they don't accidentally fall off and get damaged. \n Most skater girls will have a slight tom-boyish look to them. If you like to wear makeup, limit yourself to a tinted moisturizer and dark-colored eyeliner. If you want to give your lips some color, try wearing some lip gloss. \n Try a smoky-eye look with thick, black eyeliner. You can also pair this with some tinted moisturizer, but don't add blush, bronzer, contouring, and lipstick, or your makeup will look too heavy. \n You can also tie it back into a ponytail. \n If your hair is curly or wavy, you can straighten it or leave it natural. \n If your hair is already straight, try adding in some beach waves into it for some texture. \n If you have long bangs, consider braiding them, and pinning them out of the way with a couple of bobby pins. \n \n If your hair is too long to spike up, but too short to pull back, try wearing a hat over it. You can also brush it off to the side, or clip your bangs back. \n Keep in mind, however, that if you have really dark hair and want to dye it a lighter color, you will need to bleach it first. If you don't bleach it, the color may not show up. You can dye your bangs a punky color, such as blue, green, or purple. You can also try adding some colored streaks to it. \n If you want to dye your hair a punky color, but don't know what color to choose, try using some colored hair chalk in your hair; it will wash out the next time you wash it. \n You can experiment with streaks by clipping in a colored hair extension. \n The skater style takes some inspiration from the scene and emo style. If you want to get fancy with your hair, this is something you could try. Be sure to cut lots of layers and to texture it with razor scissors. Style it by brushing the bangs off to one side. \n If you have curly hair, try straightening just the bangs and leaving the rest of your hair curly. This will create a nice mixture of different textures. \n Almost anything goes when it comes to skater fashion, but most girls will pair a certain pattern, such as florals or checkered, with something solid colored. Here are some patterns and colors commonly seen in skater girl fashion: \n Plaids \n Checker \n Pinstripe \n Black and white \n Black and red \n Solid white \n Solid black \n Skater fashion is all about layering baggy and fitted clothes. It's also about combining patterns, such as plaid or checkered, with solids. Here are some ideas to get you started: \n Wear a long-sleeved shirt under a short-sleeved shirt. \n Pair a plaid button-down shirt with a white fitted shirt. \n Wear a loose shirt if you are wearing tight pants, and a fitted shirt if you are wearing baggy pants. \n Skater girl fashion is usually a combination of punk, scene, and tomboy.Here are some ideas to get you started: \n Go monochrome with black jeans, black skater shoes, a faded black or grey vintage t-shirt, and a black and red cap. \n Mix and match with a pair of baggy capris, knee-high socks, a fitted shirt, a cap, and a pair of skater shoes. \n Play with layers by wearing a black ¾ sleeve shirt with a white t-shirt over that. Tie a red, plaid flannel shirt around your waist. Finish the look with some skinny jeans, canvas sneakers, and a cap. \n Go casual with a pair of skinny jeans, a loose-fitting white t-shirt, a pair of canvas sneakers, and a beanie. \n There is nothing wrong with that. Just be sure to layer different textures, colors, and patterns. Here are some ideas to get you started: \n Try a red, plaid uniform skirt and a white, button-down shirt. Don't forget to wear a pair of fitted biker shorts under your skirt, especially if you plan on doing some skating that day. \n If it's a hot day, try wearing a pair of shorts and a white cropped, fitted top. Pair this with a light-colored beanie or a loose-fitting macramé top. \n Pair a black fitted shirt with a pair of shorts and black canvas sneakers. Wear a red plaid flannel shirt over this to complete the layered look. \n If you like wearing long pants, you can show off your girly side by pairing loose-fitting jeans with a pink tank top. You can also pair a loose t-shirt with some floral-printed skinny jeans. \n Don't limit yourself to just one wristband. Try wearing several. You can also pair a cap with some fingerless gloves, or a choker necklace with a pair of earphones draped around your neck. \n 
 of kefir grains into a jar. Add ½ to ¾ cup of raw or non-homogenized milk and let sit in a dark environment for 24 hours. \n \n If it’s thick and creamy, drain the yogurt from the Kefir grains using a strainer. \n Stir in ¼ to ½ cup of kefir yogurt., Always test the temperature while stirring to obtain the exact temperature. While waiting for the milk to warm, dilute ¼ tsp. of liquid animal rennet into ¼ cup of purified water., Stir for 30 to 60 seconds and cover for 1 hour., If you have a clean break, it should like Jell-O and will leave a hole. If it is still liquid like, cover for another 30 minutes and try this step again., Resist the urge to keep checking on the milk; it needs to retain the heat for the fermentation process to begin. \n After 4 hours, the curds should have sunken to the bottom of the whey and will have connected back together. \n Try your best to make one solid level piece similar to a pie. Poke several holes on the top of the curd. You will then see whey accumulate in the holes that you created., This should be done right away to get a base line of the pH. Normally, it will be around 6.2 at this point, but it will vary., As a rule of thumb, the desired pH is 5.2. However, this is subjective. For a tougher and denser mozzarella, a desired pH would be 5.3 to 5.4. For a softer mozzarella, a desired pH would be 5.0 to 5.1. \n The fermentation process can range from 2 to 18 hours depending on the amount of cultures present in the kefir and the climate that you live in. Test periodically after the initial test and then every hour once the pH has reached 5.5 to 5.6 range. \n It should be one solid dense piece at this point. Cut the curd into half inch squares., Place the chopped-up curds into the first bowl, fill the second bowl with cool water and the third with ice and water., Do not pour directly onto the curds, but rather around the rim of the mixing bowl., Sprinkle 1 tbsp. of salt onto the cheese curds and then dump 2 to 3 more cups of hot water into the bowl and let sit for 1 more minute., If they are ready for stretch, they should stick together and not fall apart. Scoop the curds up and let gravity do its work. The cheese should stick to the spoon and begin to stretch on its own. \n You can assist the stretching by grabbing the bottom of the cheese and pulling it down. If it is too hard to stretch, simply place all the cheese back in the hot water and let it sit a little longer. Stretch into a long 2-inch-wide strip and fold over 3 to 4 times. \n Do not over work the stretching because doing so will make for a tough and dry mozzarella cheese. Once you have repeated this process 3 – 4 times and the mozzarella is smooth, it’s time to form the fresh mozzarella balls. \n Squeeze the bottom of the ball and break it off., Repeat this step until you have made all of the mozzarella balls and let them sit in the cool water for 10 minutes or until they have all cooled down., This preserves the shape of the fresh mozzarella. \n There you have it: you have made fresh mozzarella using cultures. It is ready to eat at this point and is always best right after the stretch. \n 
 PokEdit is compatible with the 3DS, 3DS XL, DSi, DSi XL, DS, and the DS Lite. \n This allows you to connect to the PokEdit server so you can obtain your Pokémon character., Your Nintendo console and computer must be connected to the same network for this method to work., A list of popular Pokémon characters will display on-screen., Basic details about that particular Pokémon character will display on-screen, such as its gender, appearance, special abilities, and more., You can change its name, level, gender, language, held items, abilities, moves, mood, stats, hatch location, and more., GTS stands for Global Telecommunications System, which is the Internet protocol your Nintendo console uses to communicate with your network and the PokEdit server., The Global Terminal is located at the Pokémon Center for the Black and White editions, in Goldenrod City for the HeartGold and SoulSilver editions, and in Jubilife City for the Platinum, Diamond, and Pearl editions., Your character will drop into the GTS room, and you’ll be awarded with the new Pokémon character you created using PokEdit.
\n The school districts collaborate with the colleges but do not set the requirements. They are decided by the state education agency in coordination with the state teacher colleges. \n During the usual alternative certification, you will not do practice teaching because you will already be working as a full-time teacher (you will avoid the traditional, college undergraduate teacher training program that would have been required while the student was a junior and senior in the traditional collegiate training). \n In some states, for example in Texas, there are state credentialed teacher training companies that are setup under state law as organizations to recruit and prepare already degreed persons to receive alternative certification, without going back to college. The candidate must pass state required general and subject-area (content) teacher tests. Every time you pass a content test it makes you Highly Qualified (HQ) in that subject-area. This is an important step in qualifications for getting hired and certified. There are options, for the candidate, for the required training from the company "online" or a combination of "face to face and online". The initial cost in the program is a small down payment to the training company, then after being hired by a school district and working as a teacher you must pay the balance on an installment plan.One option is for one year training while teaching full-time. Then the candidate receives a state probationary certificate in that program, and the company will provide training for additional cost after being hired by a school district and working as a teacher. You may pay the balance on an installment plan. \n A second option is "Clinical Training", where the candidate can get certified in one semester by doing student teaching in the program. \n Vocational education teachers do not need much or perhaps need no college coursework or only a state certificate in the craft or skill for teaching technical crafts and trade class subjects in general -- but they would be licensed and certified in their field of crafts and skills such as in the building trades and automobile mechanics and other similar areas and courses of training, work and study. \n When there is a vacancy for availability to be hired -- then you would be asked to schedule for an interview to be hired. \n There may be several candidates, and the interviews may be crucial in your being the one chosen/accepted by the principal of the school and hired. \n Dress and behave professionally; be pleasant and calm. \n You will be asked on the application and during interviews: \n Why do you want to be a teacher. \n What are your long term career goals. \n How will you handle classroom discipline, and similar questions. \n Be ready to explain your system of classroom management with consistent teaching practices, "firm but fair discipline (treating everyone as equals, but as individuals where applicable)", such as: a "progressive discipline" process -- first post and explain 5 or 6 rules; then for instance speak to an offender (and make a record ), next-time schedule a before or after school detention for 5 or 10 minutes in your room , next make a phone call home. Only plan to send a student to the principal/or assistant principal, if you can not reasonably handle the difficulty, but never letting it get out of hand (very rarely a student might need to be escorted from your room by office personnel, or a hall monitor). \n \n You might in some cases be allowed to try again on a probationary basis to pass the test by a certain date while teaching, or reassigned until your pass the test, if the local district needs or wants to keep you. \n \n To be eligible for consideration for such teaching you would be required at least the minimum grade average and number of college credit hours, for example: some states require at least being classified as a senior in good standing with a GPA (grade point average) on a 4 point scale "C+" (2.5), or "B-" (between 2.5 and 3.0) average in college, and possibly require a "B" (3.0) average in your teaching field subject such as math or science.\n \n A teaching field may be similar to taking a minor in a subject: some states require 18 or 24 approved college hours including 12 advanced level credit hours to be completed to become "permanently/or provisionally" certified. \n While your degree may be earned in any valid degree subject, and most degree subjects are potentially teaching fields, yet some may not be taught in the schools, yet you may still be hired for teaching a needed subject, if you possess the minimum qualifications. \n Teaching fields become classified as "needed" teaching fields as determined by the school district -- depending on their needs and state law. \n 
\n For example, descriptions of autographed manuscripts and documents need to include type of autograph e.g. typed letter signed, handwritten letter signed, size, date, and condition. Descriptions of books containing autographs need to include information about the book e.g is it a first edition? and condition of accompanying dust jacket. Potential buyers also need to know details of any inscription that accompanies an autograph on a book or photograph. \n This number is the least amount of payment you are willing to accept on the sale of your item. Setting the bottom limit protects you from having your item sold at an unreasonably low price or at a significant loss. \n Check autograph collecting publications, such as "Autograph Collector", that list advertisers from autograph auction companies, and websites like Roger Epperson's Autograph Alert Truth for reviews of autograph auction houses. \n For example, some auction houses specialize in autographs from famous sports personalities, others may specialize in notable personalities who have autographed stocks and bonds. \n Public records show that "Remember When Auctions" and "RRAuctions" have been involved in lawsuits related to autograph fraud. The Universal Autograph Collectors Club has issued warnings on at least one autograph auction company from New Hampshire. \n Autograph auction houses usually supply their terms on request. Often, this information is downloadable from their website. \n Unless you are a professional autograph dealer, the auction company should take responsibility for proper evaluation of your autographs, and also provide guarantees of authenticity to their customers. \n Is the auctioneer properly licensed in states that require licensing? Is the auctioneer a full-time autograph dealer or a front for an autograph dealer? \n Be prepared to send them copies of your autographs. \n This includes commissions, production costs, catalog photos, mailing and packaging, applicable taxes, and interest on cash advances. Get all of their fees in writing before proceeding further. \n
 To file for divorce in Delaware, either spouse must live in the state or be stationed in the state as a member of the military for at least 6 months before the filing of the petition. Only one spouse must meet the residency requirement in order to get divorced in Delaware. Therefore, if you or your current spouse is a resident of Delaware and has been for the past six months, you may file for divorce in Delaware. \n If neither you or your spouse has lived in Delaware for at least 6 months, you will have to get divorced elsewhere, or wait to file until one of you meets the 6 month residency requirement.\n In Delaware, the court will enter a divorce if the parties’ marriage is “irretrievably broken” and reconciliation between the parties is unlikely. You can show that you and your spouse will not reconcile due to one of the following reasons: \n You and your spouse are voluntarily living apart. You and your spouse are separated due to your spouse’s “marital misconduct.” You and your spouse are separated due to your spouse’s mental illness. You and your spouse separated because the two of you are incompatible. , You must file a petition for divorce in the county where you or your spouse lives. This county is where your divorce hearings will take place, and where you will turn in all of your paperwork. , Delaware courts will “equitably distribute” property when a couple divorces. “Equitable distribution” means that the court can distribute all property that either spouse or both spouses have, regardless of whose name it is in and when the property was acquired. When determining how to divide the property, the court, without regard to marital misconduct, will consider the following: The length of the marriage. \n Any prior marriages of the parties. \n The age, health, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties. \n Whether the property award is in lieu of or in addition to alimony. \n The opportunity of each spouse for future acquisitions of capital assets and income. \n Each spouse's contribution to or dissipation of the marital estate, including the contribution of a party as homemaker. \n The value of the property owned by the parties. \n The economic circumstances of each spouse at the time of the division, including the desirability of awarding the family home to the party who will have custody of any children. \n If you and your spouse have children, the court will come up with a custody and child support arrangement that is in the “best interests of the child.” This could mean that you and your spouse will share custody, or the court could award one party full custody. The court will not give any preference to the mother when awarding custody. To determine what custody arrangement is in the best interests of the child, the court will consider the following factors: The wishes of you and your spouse regarding where your child or children will live. \n The wishes of your child. \n The child’s relationship with his or her parents, grandparents, siblings, or any other residents of the household or persons who may significantly affect the child's best interests. \n The child's attachment to his or her home, school and community. \n The mental and physical health of the parents and child. \n Past and present compliance by both parents with their rights and responsibilities to their child. \n Evidence of domestic violence against the child or against either parent. \n The criminal history of either parent, and of any person living with one of the parents. \n A party may request alimony for a length of time that is up to 50% of the length of the marriage, unless the parties have been married for 20 years or longer, in which case there is no limit to the amount of time that a spouse can receive alimony. Delaware only allows an award of spousal support (alimony) to a party that is “dependent” on the other spouse. To qualify, the asking spouse must show that he or she is “dependent” because he or she: Lacks sufficient property, including any award of marital property made by the Court, to provide for his or her reasonable needs. \n Is unable to support himself or herself through appropriate employment or is the custodian of a child whose condition or circumstances make it impossible or extremely difficult to work. \n Is dependent on the other party for support, and will not be provided for by anyone else. \n While having an attorney to advocate on your behalf may insure that the divorce process goes smoothly, you may be able to complete the divorce without a lawyer. \n If you and your spouse agree on how to divide your property, and if you there are no children involved, you can probably file for divorce on your own and save money. If you do not have an attorney, you and your spouse will be responsible for filing all of your paperwork, and will each talk to the judge without getting any help preparing. \n If you and your spouse do not agree on how to separate your property, or if you have children and need to come up with a custody arrangement, you should hire an attorney to assist you. A “contested” divorce where the parties do not agree can be extremely complicated, and you should have an expert to help you get the best possible outcome. \n If you decide to hire an attorney, you should research possible candidates to find one that is right for you. To begin the process, considering doing the following: \n Get a referral from a friend or family member who has used a divorce lawyer before. Find out who they hired and if they would recommend the attorney. If you can’t get a referral from anyone you know, check online websites like Find Law, Avvo, and Yahoo Local to find a qualified attorney. \n Once you have a list of attorneys that you think may be a good fit, set up “consultation” meetings so you can meet face to face. During the meeting, you can ask questions about your case and situation, and gauge whether you get along with the attorney. \n After meeting with potential attorneys, decide which one is the best for your particular situation. You should consider the amount of experience the attorney has, the price he or she will charge, and how well you got along with the attorney. \n If, after meeting with an attorney, you think of other questions you would like to ask, don’t hesitate to call back and ask. You should make an informed decision, and the attorney that you are considering should not have any problem answering any and all questions that you may have. \n If you cannot afford an attorney, you can try to obtain legal help on a “pro bono” (free) basis. To get help finding an attorney, call 302-478-8850 if you live in New Castle County and 1-888-225-0582 if you live in Kent or Sussex County. , To begin the divorce process, will need to fill out a “petition” to divorce. The petition tells the court why you want to get divorced, and provides the court with your information and your spouse’s information. The petition can be found by clicking here. To fill out the petition, you must include the following information: Your name and address (put in the “petitioner” spot if you are filing for divorce). \n Your spouse’s name and address (put in the “respondent” spot). \n Both your date of birth and your spouse’s. \n Both your occupation and your spouse’s. \n The names of any children of the marriage. \n The date that you and your spouse separated. \n Details regarding your spouse’s “marital misconduct,” if that is the applicable reason for the divorce. \n Details regarding your spouse’s “mental illness,” if that is the applicable reason for the divorce. \n Whether you want an “uncontested divorce,” or a “contested divorce.” Choose “uncontested” if you and your spouse agree on the issues, and “contested” if you do not. \n The petition must be signed in the presence of a notary public. Do not sign it until you are in the presence of a notary, or you will have to complete the petition again. , In addition to the petition, you must complete an “information sheet” and a “vital statistics form” in order to begin the divorce process. Additionally, if you have children with your spouse, you may have to fill out additional forms. \n Information Sheet: This form provides the Court with general information about the parties which allows the Court to adequately notify the parties about upcoming proceedings. \n Vital Statistics Form: This form will contain similar information to what was included on the Information Sheet. However, the information on this sheet is provided directly to the Division of Public Health and Vital Statistics for their records. This form must be filled out in black ink or typed. \n In order to give your spouse “notice” of your divorce, you will fill out a Request for Notice form. On this form you will tell the Court how you want to notify your spouse about the divorce action. If your spouse lives in Delaware and you know his or her address, you must ask the Court to personally serve him or her with a copy of the petition. This means that someone will deliver the petition to your spouse. \n If you do not know where your spouse lives, you must ask the Court to publish a notice of the petition in the newspaper at your expense. You must also complete an Affidavit that a Party’s Address is Unknown. \n Take all of the paperwork that you have filled out (the Petition, the Information Sheet, the Vital Statistics form and the Request for Notice) to the courthouse in the county where you or your spouse resides. Be prepared to pay a filing fee at the time you file. To find out what the filing fee is, you can look at the Family Court website or go to the Family Court Resource Centers located in each courthouse. \n In Kent and Sussex Counties you may file your papers at the Resource Centers on the first floor of the Family Court Building. In New Castle County, you may file your papers at the Resource Center on Lower Level 1 (LL1) of the New Castle County Courthouse. , Your spouse has 20 days from the date of service (the date that he or she receives your petition) to respond to your Petition for Divorce. Your spouse may file an answer to your petition where your spouse may admit or deny any of the statements that you made in your petition. On the answer, your spouse may also “counterclaim” for divorce. A counterclaim means that your spouse is filing his/her own petition for divorce, and can ask the court for a different distribution of property or child custody arrangement than the one you asked for. \n The “answer” uses the same for as the “petition” and can be found by clicking here. \n However, be aware that you must prove any allegations of misconduct by presenting evidence of the misconduct to the Court before a divorce will be granted on this ground. \n Your spouse was served with the Petition for Divorce and either responded within 20 days or did not respond. \n You have completed the required Parent Education Classes and filed the Certificate of Completion with the Court if you and your spouse have children. \n You and your spouse have not lived together for the 30 days preceding the divorce action and have not had sexual relations during that time. \n Once your petition for Divorce is trial-ready, you will receive a Notice from the Court telling you that your petition is trial-ready and that you can proceed with the divorce process. \n If your petition is uncontested and you marked on the petition that you wanted the Court to proceed without a hearing, you can be granted a divorce without attending a hearing. If you chose not to have a hearing, you will receive a “Notice of Trial-Readiness” telling you that your petition is trial-ready and that you have 20 days to file the following forms: Request to Proceed Without a Hearing: Within 20 days of the date on which you receive your “Notice of Trial Readiness,” you should file this form with an attached copy of your Notice and mail one copy to your spouse. If you fail to file this request within the allotted time, you will have to appear in court to obtain your divorce. \n Affidavit in Support of the Request to Proceed Without a Hearing: This document must be filed along with your “Request to Proceed Without a Hearing.” On this document you are swearing that the information contained in your divorce petition is true. The Court will rely on this information when making a determination regarding your divorce, so it is extremely important to be honest. \n If the court grants your request to proceed without a hearing, your divorce will be completed. If not, a hearing will be scheduled for you. \n If the petition was uncontested and you marked on your petition that you wanted to proceed with a hearing or if your spouse contested the divorce petition, you will receive a “Notice of Hearing” notifying you of the date of your hearing. You must come to Court on the day of your hearing for your divorce to be granted. If you fail to appear at the hearing, the Court may dismiss your petition and you will have to start the process over and pay the filing fee again. Make sure you are on time to your hearing, judges often hear more than one divorce at a time, so you do not want to hold everyone up. \n If the judge asks you any questions, address him or her as “your honor” and make sure to be polite and respectful. \n Whether your divorce is decided at a hearing or by agreement, you must comply with the "terms" that are included in your divorce order. The divorce order is the "law" of your divorce, so failing to follow the instructions in the final order could result in legal consequences, such as paying a fine or, in some cases, going to jail. \n If there is something in your divorce order that you want or need to change, contact the clerk's office at the court where you were granted your divorce, and ask about "modification." \n If your former spouse is not complying with the terms of your divorce agreement, contact an attorney to determine your options for making him or her comply. \n 
\n Brown both sides of the meat in it. \n If some of the flour has burned in the pan the wipe away the burnt oil and flour with a paper cloth. Flour almost always burns on, so a consequential removal of burnt residue is virtually unavoidable. \n Add the wine and the tomato paste and then the meat. \n It should boil somewhat throughout the entire cooking process of 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The meat should be very tender after 1 1/2 but, it can be cooked for up to 2 hours if you want to be absolutely sure it's done (larger cuts). Once it's done remove it from the liquid. Keep the meat warm and covered with aluminum foil in your oven-at a warming, not backing heat temperature. Strain the liquid into a metal bowl and use a spoon to press the vegetables squeezing as much of the liquid out of them as possible. \n They should be the very last thing that's ready and when you strain them the rest of the meal should already be on the table, waiting to be served. \n Stir in the strained liquids, the heat should be set high because the sauce must cook vigorously till it thickens, you will have to stir (also vigorously) while it cooks to keep it from burning at the bottom. \n
 Take off the cap and wash it. Cut the bottom, and along the sides. This will create a flat sheet. It is okay if the sides are somewhat jagged, as you will trim it later. Once you have the flat sheet, roll it backwards along the table to undo the curve the can naturally has.\n Cut that rectangle out and trim any jagged edges still there. Be very careful not to cut yourself. Recycle the other pieces. \n If it helps, fold it along a ruler. Unfold after you've done this. \n Cut along these lines and trim the pieces that hand off. You should have one half being 6cm x 9cm and the other being 4cm x 8cm. \n Line two edges of the smaller edge with this Blu-Tac, then flatten it out slightly. \n Press the Blu-Tac under the metal. Next, line the top of the piece you just folded over with more Blu-Tac, directly over the other bead of Blu-Tac. \n Be gentle, making sure to not tear the metal. If possible, use small pliers. \n It is not very important for the edge to be perfectly straight, but it helps a lot if it is. It should now be approximately 9cm long and 4cm wide. \n If necessary, fold it in half then flatten it. \n Wrap the first one so it is completely covered twice, then add the second straw, continuing to wrap the Blu-Tac around both straws until the Blu-Tac is used up. Make sure to add enough Blu-Tac so that the straws are well-secured by a good plug of Blu-Tac. \n Add some more Blu-Tac until it forms a good seal. Remember the Goldilocks principle: not too much, not too little. \n Fold the two outer pieces up, and squeeze them with the pliers. Add any needed Blu-Tac. \n \n Test that it is airtight by putting it underwater and blowing. If you see any bubbles, give that area a gentle squeeze with the pliers and try again. \n Leave the top closed when you do this. If it opens using the carton itself, use the end that is not open. If it uses a bottle top, use the side without the bottle top. \n Cut out any Windows, and decorate it as you see fit. Put aside the cabin to attach later with glue, tape or Blu-Tac, attach the 'cabin' to the boat. \n It may be easier to cut this part with a knife. If desired, twist the knife around in the hole to scrape the edges so they are smooth. \n Snip off any extra that extends past the end of the boat. \n Once you have successfully taped the straws to the bottom, cover the hole on both sides with Blu-Tac. Quickly test the boat to see if it's watertight. If not, add more Blu-Tac. \n Attach it with glue, tape or Blu-Tac. Your boat and cabin are now complete. \n You can also do it by sucking water into your mouth. Once prepped, tape the straw back to the boat. \n After a few moments, the boat will being to move forward in the water and make its signature popping sound. \n
 Avoid allowing situations to rule your life -- not being too upset by: \n ~ "People" that might even seem to try to disappoint you -- but accept them as they are, and expect your own best by not letting others' coldness or paranoia to stop your outgoing, positive efforts. \n ~ "Circumstances" that might easily disappoint you, but work through them and keep going toward your goals. \n ~ "Yourself" by not thinking of yourself as a disappointment to others or to yourself. Do your part, and be above board: sincerely engaged and say: \n "I'm still trying."\n \n Keep growing into a higher calling to go beyond disappointing circumstances. \n "Knock-knock!" \n \n Let yesterday and its events go. Do not bury them deep in your mind where they will turn sore/sour and even poisonous (to your own attitudes): \n "Get rid of it!" Get busy today, carrying good attitudes into tomorrow. \n Don't let anyone be your enemy -- but seek to demonstrate friendship, even if the other party is not seeking your friendship. \n \n Don't let the tides of life throw you off your plan -- or your course for your career, family, friends. \n Let each passing day stay in its place (the past). Let today be your day of unfolding hope, faith, truth and love! Love without keeping score: unconditionally, while setting goals for yourself to go beyond. \n Then be looking for the flood of opportunities in life (also called "problems" to solve) that the future holds for you and yours. \n This may be working, studying or practicing more than ever, thinking proactive thoughts, such as: "I'll show them that I can be/do great!" Then do better than anyone would expect by using weakness to spark a flow of energy! \n Sustain your efforts, working smarter, not just harder or longer -- to build-up some talent with faith and hope for real success. \n 
 By listing your obstacles, you can begin to address and overcome them. \n Be honest with yourself when making your list. Don’t write, “I have no time” if the real reason is that you don’t know how to get started. \n Creating an honest list of reasons can also help you see that you don’t have as many obstacles as you thought. \n For example, you may think you have lots of obstacles to you meditating, but after writing them down, find out that you only have two or three.\n \n If you don't have time to spend an hour meditating, or you get frustrated easily, then try half an hour. Or ten minutes. \n One true moment in meditation will be greater than one hour spent fidgeting and grumbling. \n Try meditating first thing in the morning or last thing at night. At these times, you will probably be least busy and will find it easier to be motivated to meditate. \n Moreover, early morning meditation may help you focus throughout the day, and late night meditation may help you sleep more deeply. \n While simply scheduling it in may not motivate you to meditate, at least you won't have anything else to do at that moment. And since you don’t have anything else to do, why not meditate? \n Get out your calendar, planner, or agenda and write the time in for meditation each day or every few days. \n Add it to your daily To Do list or set a daily alarm on your electronic device. \n You may want to start by scheduling about half an hour for your meditation session and then increasing it over time. \n If you feel physically uncomfortable in one posture, then motivate yourself to meditate by trying another position. \n If you are uncomfortable, you'll hardly be able to motivate yourself to practice meditation on a regular basis! \n Try sitting on a pillow, cushion, or mat if you are going to meditate on the floor. You can lean against a wall as you sit if you need to. \n Meditate while sitting in a chair. Sit back in the chair and make sure you feel comfortable before you begin meditating. \n You can also meditate while lying down. \n But, you can motivate yourself to meditate if you remind yourself that in meditation, there is no such thing as failure.Or success, really. With meditation you are attached to the process, not to your results. \n Tell yourself, “I can’t be good or bad at meditating. I can’t succeed at it or fail. But, I can do it.” \n If you must think of things in terms of success or failure, then consider it a success anytime you attempt to meditate. \n For example, if you can only meditate for a minute or two at a time, then give yourself credit for that! \n By thinking about your reasons you will be addressing obstacles to you meditating. And just by focusing your thinking on this one topic, you will actually be meditating. \n For example, focus your mind on the thought, “I can find a way to overcome the obstacles to me meditating.” \n Allow your thoughts and concerns about meditation to flow freely. Gently redirect your thoughts if they stray from the topic of meditating. \n You might say to yourself, “I’m thinking about dinner. Let me think more about meditating.” \n As you think of obstacles, ask yourself, “How can I overcome this obstacle?” \n 
 Vasopressin is a polypeptide or protein hormone that is secreted by the pituitary gland from its posterior part. Its secretion is not regulated by hormones from the hypothalamus such as occurs for all hormones of the anterior pituitary gland. Instead, its secretion is stimulated or inhibited based on the state of osmolality of the blood.\n Increased osmolality of the blood stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete more of this hormone. On the other hand, low osmolality of the blood inhibits its secretion by the same gland. In addition the volume of blood is also a crucial factor in the stimulation or inhibition of the secretion of this hormone. Increased blood volume or hypervolemia inhibits the secretion of this hormone while low blood volume in the arteries stimulates its secretion such as occurs in a of state of shock. \n The main function of this hormone is to stimulate the re-absorption or conservation of water in the kidney tubules. One of the clinical symptoms to this function is an increase in blood pressure with subsequent development of edema. \n The first disorder that involves this hormone and which is discussed here is the diabetes insipidus disorder. This is a disorder of the posterior pituitary gland in which it secretes the hormone vasopressin to the blood circulation in deficient amount. This can occur for example after a surgery to the brain in the region near the pituitary gland which can affect this gland also. \n The net result is the lack of stimulus for the kidney to conserve water in the kidney tubules into the blood circulation with subsequent development of polyurea with very dilute urine. This condition must be distinguished clinically from other diseases that can cause polyurea also such as diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure. \n In this case the pituitary gland secretes this hormone in normal physiological quantity. The only problem arises due to kidney problems in which its cellular receptors for this hormone do not respond properly for the stimulation by the hormone. This type of the disease is called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. \n This disorder is called syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion to the blood. It involves the secretion of excessive amount of the hormone vasopressin to the blood circulation. \n In addition, many diseases on the central nervous system are associated with increased secretion of this hormone to the blood circulation ectopically. \n The clinical picture of this disorder is of increased amount of water that is conserved in the kidney tubules causing elevated blood pressure or hypertension with subsequent development of edema. The treatment for this condition is to remove the source of malignancy that is causing the secretion of the hormone by surgery. \n This hormone is usually metabolized and neutralized in the liver. In the case of liver failure this metabolism is disrupted so that the half life of it becomes longer which would allow for its lingering in the blood more time. Thus it exerts more effect on the kidney to conserve more water. This would give symptoms that are associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. \n 
 Remove the guitar strings and then unscrew the neck of the guitar from the body. Once the body is standing alone, unscrew the screws and knobs on the front of the guitar. Remove the screws on the pickups and bridge of the guitar.If there is a faceplate over your volume knobs, you'll have to remove the plastic portions of the knobs before you can lift the faceplate off.\n Once all of the screws are out on the face of the guitar, you can lift up your bridge and pickups, which are connected by wires. Snip these and solder them later when you put your guitar back together. If you feel unsure about taking your guitar apart, take it to a guitar store so that they can safely do it for you. Make sure all the electrical wiring is removed from the guitar before you start painting it. \n Set your heat gun or hairdryer to the lowest setting and move it back and forth, across the body of your guitar. The heat from your hairdryer or heat gun will soften the finish on your guitar and make it easier to lift up the paint. Continue heating the paint for five minutes and then use a sharp tool to poke at the paint. If the paint feels soft, you can go onto the next step.Do not hold the heat gun in one spot for too long or you may burn the wood that's under the paint. \n Start by scoring a small location on the softened paint. Use your putty knife to lift off the old finish and don't worry if it cracks off. Continue to scrape the paint and remove the old finish without damaging the wood under it. If the paint isn't coming off, use the heat gun again to soften it. Once you're done removing the finish, you should see the wood grain under it., Use a 100 grit sandpaper at first and sand over the surface of the guitar's body in the direction of the grain. Sand down irregularities so that the body of the guitar is as smooth as possible. Follow the contours of the guitar and sand the sides and edges of the guitar as well. Once you've sanded it with the 100 grit sandpaper, you can move to a 200 grit sandpaper to sand out smaller irregularities.Use a sanding block if the sandpaper is hurting your hands. \n As you sand down your guitar, you're likely to find bumps or divots in the body. Fill divots that you can't sand down with an automotive filler. Once the divots are filled, let it dry for at least 20 minutes so that the automotive filler can cure.Bondo is a popular type of automotive filler., Once you've filled in all divots and the guitar is relatively smooth, you'll have to do one last sanding with the 100 grit sandpaper. Continue to sand until the automotive filler lies flush with the body of the guitar., Don't saturate the wood grain on your guitar to prevent moisture from getting absorbed into to the guitar. Take a microfiber cloth or a clean rag and wipe over the surface, making sure to remove any sawdust or debris that might be on the guitar. \n Debris or dust left on the guitar will get sealed into the paint job. \n Lay down drop cloths under the guitar so that the paint doesn't stain the surface that you're painting on. Alternatively, you can hang the guitar from the ceiling and spray it as it's suspended in the air., You can purchase wood sealer online or at a hardware store. Purchase a water based wood sealer that has a high gloss. If you are painting your guitar a lighter color, use a white sealer and if you're painting it a dark color, apply a gray sealer., Saturate a dry rag in the sealer. Once the rag is saturated, drag it along the grain on the surface of your guitar. Make long movements and do not scrub in a single area with the sealer. Once the back of the guitar is sealed, turn the guitar over and finish sealing the front and sides.Once your rag looks dirty, dispose of it and use another, clean rag. \n Let the sealer dry for an hour or two and come back and apply another even coat of sealer. The sealer will help the colored coats of paint adhere to the body of the guitar much easier. Continue adding more coats of sealer until you've covered the guitar three to five times in total.Remember to let the sealer dry in between each new application. \n Feel over the sealer to make sure that it's no longer wet or sticky. Make sure that the guitar dries in a well-ventilated area so no one gets sick from the sealer's fumes., Using a 200 grit sandpaper, carefully sand over the shiny parts of the sealer. Make sure not to sand too hard or you may expose the wood grain underneath. If you do do this, simply reapply more coats of sealer to the guitar and allow it to dry before moving on. When you're done, the guitar should have a dull white or gray color., Typical guitar paint includes polyester, polyurethane, and nitrocellulose. Polyurethane and polyester will result in a harder, more plastic-feeling finish on your guitar while nitrocellulose is lighter and thinner. If you're unsure of what kind of paint to get, look for spray paint that's made specifically for guitars., Position the nozzle on the spray can 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 cm) away from the body of the guitar. Remember to cover the edges of the guitar. Press down on the button on the spray can and go in long, sweeping back and forth motions across the body of the guitar., Touch the surface of the guitar to make sure that none of the paint transfers to your hand. The paint may still be sticky and you'll still be able to see the sealer under the basecoat that you just sprayed., Once the guitar is dry, flip it over and spray down the other side of the guitar. You should now have one solid basecoat of paint over the front and back of your guitar., Allow each coat of paint to dry for five minutes before applying the next coat. Continue flipping the guitar over so that the entire guitar gets even coverage. Continue to cover your guitar in coats of paint until the paint gets darker and richer. This could take anywhere from three to seven coats of paint., Once you're done laying down the base color for your guitar, you'll have to let the paint dry for another one or two days in a well-ventilated area. Once it's completely dry, you can move onto the next step. , Once the color coat is dry, run your fingers over the surface, sides, and back of the guitar to see if the paint is smooth. If the paint rises too high in some spots or has become bumpy, you should sand it down with a wet sandpaper. Saturate the sandpaper in water overnight, then work it along the rough parts of your guitar while it's still wet.Wet sandpaper will not scratch the surface of your guitar. \n Clear lacquer paint will give your guitar a shiny finish over the paint. You can purchase clear lacquer paint at a home improvement store or online. Spray the clear lacquer the same way you sprayed the base coat, putting four separate coats of lacquer on the guitar and letting the paint dry in between sprays., Don't touch your guitar for three weeks as the paint dries. During this time the paint will cure and should be a rich solid color, but will be missing the polish that guitars typically have., Saturate a rag or cloth with car polish and work it on the surface of the guitar using small, circular motions. This should refine the shine in the guitar and make it more reflective. One you're done polishing the guitar, it should be shiny and reflective.
 We humans are well-tuned to each others body language on a subconscious level (you can usually know that someone is frustrated or upset at you without them even saying anything) but we do not have the same instinct for dog body language. To "listen" to your dog you'll need to be more conscientious. \n For example, among the signs below, for two or three weeks pay attention only to your dog's tail. \n As you become familiar with your dog's nuances with his tail, spend another few weeks paying attention specifically to his posture. \n Your dog is unique and while the signs below are a good place to start, if your dog's body language does not match up with its actions according to the guide below, then accept that your dog may have a different "body language vocabulary". \n It mean the dog is relaxed, but alert. He's waiting in anticipation of something happening. He or she expects something to happen (for example, a walk).\n It means the dog is telling you that he doesn't understand your command, and is asking you what he wants himself to do. \n It means that he's issuing a quiet challenge to your authority, since he feels that he is the dominant dog. \n It means the dog is acknowledging to you that you are in charge. He is prepared to listen to you. \n It means that he's projecting a high degree of alertness. \n It means the dog has accepted your challenge. \n It means he's letting others know that he is the leader of the pack. It's only a "gesture of a very confident canine." \n It means he's relaxed and content with the way things go. \n It means the dog is uncertain or just has the "blahs". Play with the dog, or do something out of the ordinary, for a little while. \n It means the dog is critically in fear of something painful happening. \n It means the dog is responding to a challenge or threat, and is letting his adversary know there's no way that he's not backing down. War will ensue, if two dogs adopt this stance. \n It means the dog is telling you that he accepts your dominance. \n It means something in the situation is making him unsure of himself or of what will happen next. The paw will return to the floor, when he knows the clear understanding of what's going on. \n It means two rivals have resolved the issues between them and the dog it's being placed on, is the submissive dog. \n This is an attention grabbing device. Do not interpret this as a challenge to your authority. \n This means he's eager for you to pay attention to him. He's challenging you and expects you to respond firmly. \n This means he thinks he's in charge and that if you don't accept, misbehavior ensues. \n This action means that he's letting you know that he's ready to play. \n This means he's giving you a submissive message ( such as under a possible ensuing punishment). \n This action means he's expressing nasty aggression. but don't run away from the dog-back away from the dog super-slowly. \n This action means that he's expressing curiosity and that he's paying attention to any new event in his environment. Make sure the tone of your voice and your gestures express the same mood. \n This action means the dog is expressing fear. He's reflexively trying to get his ears out of the way of whatever he perceives to be threatening to him. \n This action is a mild signal of discontent and it will usually pass by without intervention. \n This action means he's very mad and won't take it. \n Yawning means he's miffed and is the canine reflex reaction to stress. \n This action means his wanting to let the challenger know that a fight is not in the cards. If the aggressor continues to menace, look for obvious display of mission (rolling over)., This action means that he's protecting his turf (such as while he's eating), This action is a low key sign to tone down the intensity of whatever is happening between your pet and you. \n This action means they're relaxed and happy. Take advantage of it, by indulging in a little gentle playtime. \n 
, Always include this section after your name on the resume, so that the prospective employer will know who you are and what you are looking for. \n Include the names, city and state of the school, as well as a phone number. \n Every transcriptionist must highlight his/her experience in the resume. In this section you need to include all related work experience you have regarding the job for which you are applying. This leaves an impact upon the company and assures them that they have chosen a right person to work for their company. Specify the type of transcription work you have done before as it helps the prospective employer to knowing your skills, showing how versatile you are as a transcriptionist.

It may be related to your education or work. \n So you must also mention about your knowledge on Word and Word perfect as they are very useful for various transcription jobs. Make sure to mention your typing speed as well as accuracy, your ability to edit grammar and the capacity to understand different accents in this field. \n All references should be persons who are familiar with you and if asked, would give you a favorable recommendation letter. \n 
 While it is incredibly exciting to bring a new puppy home, it is also very important that you decide the different duties each family member will play in training your puppy, and the rules you will have for you puppy. Discipline is key-and not just for your pup. \n For example, if you have decided that your puppy should sleep in a crate until house trained, do not let anyone allow the puppy to sleep in its bed the first few nights.\n The puppy needs clear rules from the first day it arrives at your home. You’ll want to make the rules easy to follow. For example, if you don't want the puppy upstairs, put up a stair gate. If you don’t want a dog begging for food at the table, never feed a puppy food from your plate. Remember not to scold the puppy too much or his/her trust in you will go down \n It is nearly impossible to train a puppy without some kind of reward involved. Most puppies respond well to food rewards. However, be aware that when training with food rewards, or "treats," you should use small treats, even pieces of regular dog food work! \n Feeding large treats each time you give a reward will soon make your dog unhealthy and overweight. Use high value treats for new work, for example turkey is very healthy for dogs, and lower value foods, like a piece of dog food, when doing re-training work. \n Some puppies respond better to toys. You can reward a dog that loves fetching by throwing the ball each time he does something correct, or another dog by playing a quick game of tug-of-war. However, toy rewards take up more time, can get the puppy too excited and wound up to train, or may get boring after a while. Toys work especially well for agility training, although agility cannot be trained until 18 months of age because puppy joints and bones can’t handle this type of training. \n Different breeds of dogs are very different, so it would be a good idea to read up on your breed to know what to expect. Each breed needs specific training in order to thrive, so make sure you know what the specific needs of your dog are. \n In combination with any other reward you choose to give your pup, you must also use verbal praise. When your puppy responds correctly, praise it in a high-pitched, kind voice. Puppies respond to a pleased and happy tone. \n Clicker training is also very helpful. In this training, you purchase a clicker and each time you say the command you immediately use the clicker. \n On the other hand, when your puppy disobeys, you should use a stern voice to reprimand your pup. It is important that puppy learns the difference between your pleased voice and your voice that tells her she did something wrong. Always make up with a dog after you need to scold them. \n Also try to keep the sessions full of new, fun things, like little games you make up yourself. If you see the dog begin to get bored, distracted, or frustrated, end the session and take a break. \n If you begin to get frustrated, end the session. However, try to end on a good note, with praise and rewards. This way the puppy will look forward to the next training session. \n Try to stay committed to a 10- 15 minute session every day, so the puppy will learn new commands faster. \n Keep in mind that puppies 12 weeks or under do not have full control of their bladder or bowels. Even if they wanted to “hold-it” they simply cannot do that, so do not harshly reprimand them when they eliminate in your house. Most puppies are not fully house trained until they are six months old, and in some cases even older than that. \n When house training your pup, it is important to keep a positive attitude even when you encounter an accident. \n Puppies can generally only hold their waste in for the number of months they are old. So if your puppy is four months old, he should not be left without access to the outside for longer than four hours.It is different at night, as puppies shut down the way we do at night. By the time your puppy is four months old, he should be able to go the entire night without needing to go potty. \n As you may be able to guess, a big part of when a puppy goes potty is when it is fed. In order to speed up the house training process, establish a regular feeding schedule and stick with it. Unless advised by a vet, do not “free feed” (leaving a filled food bowl out at all times.) \n Free feeding will give your puppy a random elimination cycle (when she pees or poops) and will not establish you as the provider of the food (which is important in teaching your puppy that you are the pack leader and in charge.)Do not feed your puppy anything in between meals. \n Young puppies generally need to potty every 30 to 45 minutes. You should create a consistent schedule for when you take your puppy out. Puppies should be taken out every hour, as well as shortly after meals, naps, and playtime. You should always take your puppy out first thing in the morning, before you and the puppy go to bed at night, and before you leave the puppy alone for any extended period of time. \n Give your puppy a treat and verbally praise it when it pees or poops outside. Try to bring your puppy to the same spot each time to teach her that this is where she is meant to go potty. When you bring her to the spot, say “go potty” and wait for her to go.Bringing the puppy to the same spot will help it associate the smells of the spot with going potty. Smells can often prompt a puppy to eliminate. \n Stay with your puppy outside while it is potty training so you can immediately praise it when she goes potty. Keep in mind that some puppies will go potty as soon as your take them outside, while others may need to sniff around or play a bit before they can eliminate. \n Common signs are sniffing, circling, whining, leaving the room and pacing. Take your puppy outside as soon as possible when you see these signs. You must watch your puppy carefully. \n If you see your puppy begin to eliminate in an inappropriate spot indoors, clap twice sharply. Your clapping will startle your pup, stopping it in midstream. Quickly run with your puppy outside, either by leading it with its collar, or encouraging it to run beside you. \n Once outside, keep the puppy in one place and allow it to eliminate. When it does, verbally praise it and give it a treat. If the puppy doesn’t have anything to eliminate, don’t worry, just make sure to try to be there the next time it does so that you can bring it outside. \n Don’t scold the puppy and never rub its nose in an accident. Just clean up the mess and try to get the puppy outside next time. \n This is especially important to do when you are not home. Choose a crate or area that you can block off with a pen or baby gate and ‘puppy proof’ the area. Lay down newspapers and put its bed, toys, water and food bowls in the space. Over the course of a few weeks, you will notice that your puppy begins to pee or poop in one particular spot in the area.You can begin reducing the amount of newspaper you use in the space, so that eventually only the place the puppy has designated as her elimination spot is covered with newspaper. You will then be able to slowly start moving the newspaper to other locations closer and closer to the outside door and the puppy will continue to eliminate on them. \n If your puppy eliminates somewhere other than the designated spot, you may have reduced the amount of newspaper too much, or moved the newspaper away from the original spot too quickly. Potty training a puppy takes a long time, just remember to be patient. \n Praise your puppy when it eliminates in the designated spot. If your puppy has an accident but you do not catch her in the act, you should not reprimand her. She will not understand why you are reprimanding her for something she did an hour ago. If you do catch her right after she has had an accident, hold her near the accident and firmly say “no.” \n When your puppy has become generally reliable in using its ‘potty area’, you can begin to let the puppy explore more of your house. Its best to open the house up to your puppy one room at a time. Only do this when your puppy can be supervised--any time your puppy cannot be supervised, but her back in her ‘den.’Put your puppy on a leash when it is exploring a new room. It is much more difficult for your puppy to get into trouble when you are attached to the other end of the leash. \n Puppies explore their new world through their mouths. So they will probably bite you during their exploration or when they are playing. Puppies don’t know that their teeth can feel like razors piercing our skin when they gnaw on us, which is why it’s important to train your puppy not to bite at an early age. \n Puppies don’t know how hard their biting can be. When you are playing with your puppy, allow it to mouth on you if it is doing so already. When it bites too hard, yelp or let out a loud ‘ow!’ Doing this will startle your puppy and make it stop biting you. Ignore your puppy for 10 to 20 seconds after it has bitten you, or walk away for 10 to 20 seconds. Then go back and resume playing. When it bites too hard again, say “ow!” again and ignore it for another 20 or so seconds. Doing this teaches your puppy that gentle play continues, while painful play stops. \n Once your puppy has stopped biting you very hard, you can begin to teach it to not bite even moderately hard. Repeat the steps listed above when it bites you moderately hard. Continue this process until your puppy only mouths on you gently or doesn’t mouth on you at all. \n If you puppy likes to ambush your feet while you walk, carry a toy in your pocket. When you puppy begins nipping at your foot, freeze, take out the toy and wave it so that it gets his attention. When your puppy has started chewing on the toy, begin walking again. Eventually your puppy will learn that chewing on toys is better than chewing on feet.If you don’t have a toy, freeze when your puppy begins nipping at your feet. When it stops, praise it and go get it a toy. \n When you see your puppy chewing on something like a shoe, furniture, or sock, take the object away from him and scold him verbally. Direct its attention to something it can chew on, such as a favorite toy, and praise it when it begins chewing on that instead. Doing this teaches your puppy what objects to chew on and what not to. \n If your puppy continues to chew on things it shouldn’t be, you can use a taste deterrent, like bitter apple, to get it to stop chewing on those objects. You can buy taste deterrents at your local pet store. Bitter apple works well, as the bad taste will cause your puppy to stop chewing on the object immediately. \n Every dog should know the sit command. If you want your dog to be obedient, safe, and able to learn more complicated tricks, you must teach the sit command first.Have a treat ready to go. You should use a treat to teach this command, unless your dog doesn't like food rewards. \n Your puppy should be on a leash. The leash will help you to guide your pup’s movements. \n Hold the treat in front of your puppy's nose. While gently pulling the leash up, move the treat upwards, keeping it by your puppy's nose. \n Your puppy will most likely follow the treat up, automatically landing in a sit. If not, gently push your puppy's rear down. As soon as your dog lands in a sitting position, say "Sit!" Then give a treat and praise. \n Repeat the steps frequently and be patient. Some dogs take longer to learn than others. Once your puppy begins to recognize the word "sit," say it just before your dog actually sits. With time, patience, and practice, your dog should eventually learn to sit on command. \n Once your puppy learns to sit, it needs to learn to lay down on command. Start with your puppy in the sitting position. Once again, have a treat ready. Your puppy should be on a leash so you can control its movements.Hold the treat where your puppy can see it, in front of its nose. You may want to kneel so you are lower to the ground. \n Keeping a little pressure on the leash, so the puppy can't get the treat, move the treat slowly onto the ground. The puppy should lay down to get a little closer to the treat. \n If this doesn't work, apply slightly more pressure to the leash. Pull the collar downwards, while moving the treat. Once your puppy is laying down, say "down" and give the reward. \n Eventually say "down" right before the puppy lays down. Continue to practice these steps eventually your puppy will learn how to lay down when he hears the command. \n This is another important safety command. You need to have control over your dog and know that it will come to you when asked. \n Keep your puppy on a leash. Tell it to either sit or lay down. Take a few steps away and kneel down. Have a favorite toy with you. \n Encourage your puppy by saying its name in an excited voice. Do not apply pressure to the leash. Show the puppy its toy. Pat your knees. Continue to talk in an encouraging voice. \n When the puppy begins to come to you, say “Come!” When it gets to you, praise and reward it. \n Continue to practice this, gradually doing these steps from further away. \n Once your puppy knows the command, try calling it while it’s playing. \n This is one of the most important safety commands. Your puppy must know how to stay in one spot. This is important when taking walks, playing outside, greeting other people and dogs, etc.Keep your puppy on a leash. This time, do not show it the treat, but keep it ready to reward the puppy when the time comes. \n Have your puppy sit. Firmly, say "Stay." Hold your hand in front of the puppy just above its head. Your hand should be where the puppy can easily see it. Until your puppy has learned the command, do not move your hand. It will help it stay focused and get the message. \n Very slowly, while maintaining eye contact with the puppy, take a small step backwards. If the puppy begins to move, say in a sharp, loud voice, "Ah ah!" That will get the pup's attention and let it know it has done something wrong. Do not be upset, it does not yet know the command. Instead, firmly but gently put the puppy back in the same place, once again in a sit. The puppy must be in the same place or it will think that it can get away with moving forward even in a stay. Repeat the command and try again. \n When the puppy stays, say "Okay!" and let it get up and come to you. Praise the puppy and give it a reward. \n Continue practicing the command. Once the puppy has learned the command, gradually move farther away from it and have it wait longer until you give the command to break the stay. \n After your puppy has learned the basic commands, and is following your commands consistently and promptly, you can work on “trick” types of training. There are many good books and internet articles around that can help you find out the best tricks for your puppy to learn and the best way to teach these types of commands. \n Teach your dog how to roll over. Your friends will be impressed and overwhelmed with how cute your dog is when it rolls over. \n Teach your puppy how to high five. Its important to get your kids involved in the training process of your puppy, so why not have them train your puppy to do something both the dog and child will both enjoy? \n Teach your dog how to do the doggie dance. Can you think of anything cuter than a puppy doing a little dog dance? \n Teach your puppy how to shake hands. Shaking hands is a classic trick that all dogs should learn. \n Teach your puppy to play fetch. Puppies have a lot of energy. Why not teach your dog a trick that will burn off some of that puppy energy? \n Join in a puppy training class so your puppy can learn from other puppies, and their owners, and learn in a more distracting environment. Your local veterinarian, extension service, or pet store can help you find a good puppy training class in your area.
 Take your small car base piece and attach a 4 x 12 long piece to the back four raised studs of your base.This will form the bed and front cabin of your truck.\n The recessed area of your small car base is where the cabin of your vehicle will be and where you LEGO driver will sit. Put the steering wheel and the seat in the dropped-down area., Start by taking both your square windows and stacking them, one on top of the other. Then attach these in front of the steering wheel to complete your windshield. \n Connect your fenders in front of the windshield, so the half circles point downward on either sides of the front of your truck. \n Your front end piece, also called the license plate holder, should have two studs on top and a contoured front stretching four studs wide and two studs tall. On the recessed studs on the rightmost and leftmost side of your front end add your 1 x 1 clear orange pieces. \n Your clear orange pieces should have mad the contoured front of your front end even, which will allow you to put on a flat 2 x 4 piece on top of it. \n Now the orange pieces should be sandwiched between the 2x 4 plate the the front end piece. \n Place the sloped sides of these pieces to face off to each side of the truck. \n You should add the flat, smooth 1 x 2 piece between the sloped clear pieces. Then, below this, put the 1 x 2 flat piece with a middle circular stud directly below. \n The front-most part of your base that you have already attached fenders to will be the landing zone for your front end. Attach your front end to the free two studs at the very front of your base. \n The hood piece should fit evenly, covering all free studs on the top of your front end. On top of the hood should be two free studs. On these, you should attach the 1 x 2 air intake piece. \n Then: \n Use 1 x 8 and 1 x 4 pieces evenly to the outside of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece to make you truck bed walls. \n Leave one row of studs at the very back of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece for the hitch and license plate. \n Much like you did with the front end, you will use your license plate holder piece to create the back of your truck. On the left and right recessed studs on the top four-across row of your rear end, add red sloped pieces, slopes facing outward. Between these, attach your license plate. \n This includes a flat, yellow 1 x 4 piece with black diagonal slashes on it. This will be your read bumper. Attach it so that it stretches across the bottom of your license plate holder piece. \n On the free four studs at the very back of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece, connect your rear end. Make sure the edges meet with the walls of the bed of your truck and the rear end piece is firmly fastened. \n Then, stretching across the gap made by the 2 x 8 pieces: \n Attach two 2 x 4 blocks, on on top the other, so that both are flat against the back wall of your cabin. \n Attach two 1 x 4 pieces behind the 2 x 4 blocks. \n This should create an flat surface that is level with the roof of your cabin. \n A single row of studs should hang free the hood/window area of your truck. \n Attach your sloped window atop the 4 x 8 on the front-most studs. \n The hood cover should go in the front-center of the 4 x 8 piece for the most realistic effect. Use 1 x 8 smooth pieces on the top of the walls of the bed of your truck. \n Leave two free studs on the walls of the bed of your truck closest to the cabin. \n On top of this block, add a 2 x 2 flat piece, and atop that add a 2 x 2 spinning piece. This will allow the front wheels of your car can turn left and right. Now you can press your wheels onto the circular axles on the outside of the 2 x 4 axle piece. \n Then: \n Attach the wheel assembly so the wheels stick out under the half circles of the fenders. \n You're going to need to fashion two 2 x 2 half axles into a single piece to give the rear wheels of your truck more width. Use a 2 x 2 piece attached to the underside of the two half axles to create one 2 x 4 axle. \n Then on the 2 x 4 block, add two 2 x 2 pieces, or a single 2 x 4 piece, so that all piece form flat sides. \n Then push your wheels onto the rear axle to finish the assembly. \n Attach your wheels so the back edge of your connecting block is beneath the fourth stud from the rear of the bed of your truck. \n You might also experiment with rear wheel placement to find what looks best for you. \n Do not attach your wheel assembly to the very back of the underside of the bed of your truck; you will need some space to attach the hitch of your truck. \n Your hitch begins with a 2 x 6 flat piece. Take this 2 x 6 and add to the back-most two studs a 1 x 2 hitch piece. The hitch piece should have a round, upward facing part, which is the hitch. \n You should allow your hitch to stick out from the back of your truck about three studs. This will make your truck hitch look more realistic. \n The bed of your truck closest to the cabin still has a slight gap. Close this off to complete the bed of your truck. Do this by attaching two 1 x 2 pieces on top of each other. Then: \n Attach your 1 x 2 pieces between the walls of the bed of your truck closest to the cabin. \n Then put a 1 x 1 piece with a circular stud on the side on the rear corner of your 2 x 4 flat where it attaches to the sloped piece. \n The 1 x 1 piece with a circular side stud is where your LEGO truck can be filled up with fuel. \n The free hanging back four studs of your flat 2 x 4 piece should be pressed into the bottom of your car base beneath the driver's side door. Then, open the door and put a LEGO figurine inside. It's time to go truckin'! \n 
 They need to play no part, it's best to be around people you enjoy being with as this will help you feel at ease.\n Clothes, hair, aftershave, teeth - nothing over the top, dress appropriately, comfortable a must! 4 sprays of aftershave - behind each ear and on each shoulder. Nothing extreme, no bright colors, relaxed approach (unless you are heading somewhere which requires this). \n People go to these places knowing there are going to be other people there. They are prepared to TALK. \n You are not trying to pull tonight, you are still in training. With a pub as a scenario, don't hang outside the toilets waiting for your prey! Instead - go solo at the bar (this may sound scary, but this way no pressure, your friends can sometimes be off putting). When ordering drinks, look around casually, if you make eye contact with someone - SMILE but then turn away, remember these are skill building techniques. Spot someone of interest next to you - say hi, if you are given a positive response then follow with "having a good evening?" again, if their reaction is positive then "Okay cool, catch you later". \n This will happen naturally, we as humans are designed for conversation, it's a natural occurrence regardless of our physical appearance. \n Now all you have to do is simply add to the conversation: (Ex. "so, are you going to a bar or club after here?" or "Let me get this drink for you") \n The thing you have to remember at this stage is, if its not going too well then there is a compatibility issue, when you find the right person, you WILL click. \n \n The answer is variable - you need to strike a balance between " I'm not a stalker & hard to get" Basically not to soon and not too late. My recommendation is as follows: \n DO NOT ask for a date right now \n If you are a guy asking a girl, remember this can be delicate - I would recommend the initial meeting place to be the same venue as when you first met - the reason for this is it's a familiar place to your date and will help to make them feel at ease. \n Pre date nerves - don't worry, they will feel exactly the same! \n Remember you have one the hard part, this is now easy, you have clicked already, you have spoken, now you use this time to get to know each other. Make sure you show interest in your date, combine talking about yourself to asking questions about them and it should work both ways. \n That's down to you and your date how quickly you'd like to progress things. Just go with the flow, the combination of two people is a natural occurrence and the first kiss is included, you will both know when the time is right. \n 
 If you drive on the right you will likely involved in a serious collision, or killed, and will be arrested for dangerous driving which is a criminal offense and may end up with a custodial sentence.\n Bonnet, boot, windscreen, tyre, bumper, gearstick, mobile, car hire, roundabout, motorway, A-road, B-road, RTA, slip road, dual carriageway ...make sure you know what these mean before driving on UK roads. \n If you cannot drive a manual car, you will have to hire an automatic car because you will not be qualified to drive or insured to drive a manual car. If you have an accident whilst driving a manual that you cannot operate, you may be arrested for dangerous driving which can result in a heavy fine and maybe a custodial sentence. \n Often, there are adhesive or static shields that can be applied to the headlamps. Some cars even have a simple mechanism under the bonnet for adjusting the beam pattern. \n The UK has very strict drink and drugs regulations and many police officers pull over cars to carry out drink and drug tests on random drivers. The view of the police and the courts is that alcohol immediately makes you guilty in an accident, even if it was not your fault. Refusing to provide a breath or urine sample when asked to do so is an offence itself, and will result in your arrest. \n Always do as you're told without a bad attitude and never assume that if you are polite you will get off any offense you have committed. Always provide ID when asked. You should always carry a valid drivers licence and proof of vehicle insurance when you drive. It is a criminal offense to refuse or give false details which will result in arrest. Unlike in the USA and maybe other countries, the UK police do not need permission or a reason to stop and search you, your belongings (handbag, rucksack or pockets) or your vehicle if stopped while driving. Do not attempt to stop them as you will be detained or arrested. \n In the UK, the left hand lane is considered the "slow lane" and some drivers may pull over without checking properly which can cause an accident. Be aware that using the hard shoulder of a motorway to undertake vehicles will also result in a possible arrest. \n These are fixed cameras, mobile speed traps and are also fixed to most police vehicles. These automatic systems in police cars can also confirm whether or not the vehicle is insured or not. \n Always make sure you have the correct motor insurance policy, failure to do so will result in your vehicle being seized and you being arrested. Make sure the vehicle is road legal to UK standards, failure to do so will void any insurance policy and result in the vehicle being seized. If driving a friend's vehicle always get their permission and check your own insurance policy to make sure you are permitted to drive other vehicles. \n The speed limits on the motorways are 60mph (96km/h) for goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, 60mph (96km/h) for buses and coaches and 70mph (112km/h) for cars. , Image \n Only public buses, taxis, motorcycles, bicycles and emergency service vehicles are permitted to use this lane. Anyone else will be photographed (automatic cameras) and fined £60 for using this lane. (Approximately $100 USD). \n 
 Factors to take into account when choosing a carrier are coverage, price, texting/web/multimedia plans, customer service ratings.\n Mid-range users tend not to purchase phones with multimedia players as these tend to add a significant cost increase. \n Such phones, however, are really more for studying and may be less convenient in the daily use. \n Ask yourself if you misplace things often or if you drop things often. Choose a cell phone that is covered by cell phone insurance. An additional fee is required per month but it will save you hundreds of dollars if your phone is lost, stolen or if there is any physical or liquid damage. \n For example: only displaying the time when service is available, limits on text message storage, and shutdown sounds that can't be turned off (really embarrassing at the movies). Ask a sale person or a friend who owns the same model about specific features before you buy. \n Often if a handset has been out for a month users will have already found out about any major problems with their handset and posted on a consumer websites. You can be confident you are choosing the right mobile phone before making your high ticket purchase. \n Get a feel for the handsets and a look at the various sizes, display screens and operating systems to see what best suits your personal abilities and hand size. You can also get demonstrations and any questions you may have. They will try to encourage you to sign up but you can always say no thanks once you have the information you want. Then go home and check online for better offers. \n 
 If you are currently married to the other parent, you can petition for custody once you start one of the following cases: \n Divorces, annulments, or legal separations, which are cases you will file if you want to end your marriage with the other parent\n Domestic violence restraining orders, which you will file if you have been the victim of domestic violence\n Petitions for custody and support of minor children, which you will file if you and the other parent do not want to get a divorce, but you want to set up a custody arrangement for other reasons; or \n Child support agency cases, which occur when you are the subject of a local child support enforcement case., If you are not married to the other parent, you can petition for custody once you start one of the following cases: \n Parentage cases, which are filed when parents are not married but have children together\n Domestic violence restraining orders\n Petitions for custody and support of minor children, which can also be filed when you and the other parent were never married at all; and \n Child support agency cases., After you have opened an appropriate family law case, you will need to file a petition for custody of your child. The remainder of this article will take you through that process. \n If you can afford a family law attorney, you should consider hiring one to help you navigate the custody process. See this article for directions on how to find a good family law attorney. Even if you cannot afford a full-service attorney, many attorneys provide limited services at a reasonable cost. This means you may be able to hire an attorney to prepare your documents, give you limited legal advice, or potentially even teach you about this area of the law, without having to pay the attorney to take on the entire custody process. \n You will file your petition for joint custody in the same court you opened your family law case in. Generally, you will open your family law case in the country where your child lives.This is true even if you live in a different county. \n In order to petition the court for joint custody of your child, you will have to fill out a request for an order.This form will require you to divulge information including your request for custody and the facts supporting your request.These facts should indicate why you deserve custody of the child and how your custody request will be in the best interest of that child. \n Because you are petitioning the court for joint custody, you will need to decide what type of custody you are going to seek. You could seek either physical or legal custody, or you could seek to share either or both of those duties with the other parent. Regardless, because you are filing for joint custody, you will not be asking for full control of both the legal and the physical responsibilities of the child. \n Once you have filled out the required forms to request a custody trial, you will want to review them carefully. These forms are going to be the basis of your custody argument, so you want to make sure they have been filled out accurately and completely. If you will not have the help of an attorney, consider using some of the free legal resources available to you. For example, in California, you can contact a family law facilitator or a self-help center for assistance with these forms.If you are in California, use this link and this link for more information about those resources. \n Once your forms have been reviewed and you have determined they are ready to file, you will want to go to your local courthouse to file them. At the courthouse, file your forms with the clerk of courts.The clerk of courts will take possession of your forms and will require you to pay a filing fee.Fees will differ from state to state, and even county to county. If you cannot afford the fee, you can always ask for a fee waiver.In order to receive a fee waiver, you will need to show some sort of financial hardship.For example, you could show that you are receiving public benefits or that you do not have enough income to provide for basic necessities and pay the filing fee., When you serve the other party, you will hire someone (the sheriff or another competent adult) to give a copy of your filed documents to the other party to look over and respond to. To serve the other party, the person you hire must provide the required documents to them, either in person or through the mail.If you are serving someone through the mail, it must be sent by certified mail. In Pennsylvania, this process must be completed within 30 days of filing your documents with the court.In some states (e.g., Michigan), your answer must also be served on the other party at least five days before the hearing if you provided service through the mail, and at least three days before the hearing if you have the other party served personally.For more information about serving another party, look here. \n In addition to serving the other party with the documents you filed with the court, you will also serve the other party with a blank response form and a blank Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.These documents will be used by the other party in order to respond to your filed lawsuit. \n Once you have successfully served the other party with your petition for joint custody, the other party will have an opportunity to respond to your petition. When the other parent answers your petition, they will have the option of agreeing with your requests or denying some or all of your requests. Also, the other parent may fail to file an answer at all. \n If the other parent declines to file an answer, you could file for a default judgment. \n A default judgment cannot resolve all issues, however. For example, the court can modify visitation if the child is in your state but the other parent lives out of state. But the court probably cannot modify an order for child support from the out-of-state parent. \n If the other party filed an answer and you did not get a default judgment, some courts will require you and the other party to take part in mediation before you can go to court.If your court requires mediation, you and the other party should make a good faith effort to agree on the terms of custody there, which will allow you to avoid the trial process. For more information about mediation, look here. \n If you and the other party took part in mediation, and you came to an agreement allowing you to have joint custody of your child, get the agreement signed by the court and that will act as your valid custody order. \n In California, in order to validate a custody agreement, you must first fill out a Stipulation and Order for Custody. Once you fill out this form, you will obtain the judge's signature on your stipulation and you will file it with the clerk of courts., If you were unable to reach an agreement during mediation, or if your court does not require or offer mediation services, you will have to go to court and tell a judge why you deserve joint custody of your child. Since you are asking for joint custody, the court will look to a variety of factors to determine what is in the child’s “best interests.”These factors will differ by state. They will be listed in either a statute passed by the legislature or in a court opinion issued by your state supreme court. \n Courts will look at different factors, depending on the state. Michigan, for example, considers: the love and affection existing between the parties and the child; the ability and willingness of the parties to provide food, shelter, clothing, and medical care; moral fitness of the parent; stability of the custodial environment; and mental and physical health of the parties, among other factors.Among a variety of factors, Kentucky considers the wishes of the child; the child’s adjustment to home, school, and community; the mental and physical health of all individuals involved; as well as the interaction and interrelationship of the child to each parent and to siblings.To find the specific factors for your state, search online for “best interests of the child” and then your state. \n Understanding what you must prove at court will clarify the kinds of evidence you should seek during the discovery process. For example, you will need to prove your physical health, your willingness to provide food and medical care, as well as a stable home environment. You will also need to fend off attacks to these same characteristics. \n Studies in developmental psychology have shown that the child has formed deep attachments in the first three years of life. Severing the attachment between one parent and the child, especially if the child lived with both parents during these years, can have psychological ramifications.This concept is well-known throughout domestic relations courts, so if the child has been in the custody of both parents for three years, simply state to the court that it is in the best interests of the child to continue to have relationships with both parents. \n In order to show that you're considering your child's best interests, include evidence that you live close to the child’s school in the home that the child grew up in, that your job would not take time away from caring for the child, and that you do not have any illnesses that could interfere with the child's care. \n Write down what classes he or she is taking. Write down who are his or her doctors, teachers and other important influences. \n Include details about memories that you have with your child from when you last had custody. If you have visitation with your child currently, make sure that you ask him or her what is going on in school and with friends. \n If you are unable to get information on your child’s current activities, make sure you know basics about your child, such as your child’s age and grade in school, before attending the hearing. \n To show that you can provide a safe and stable environment for your child, show that you live near your child’s school. This will demonstrate that your child will not be taken out of their routine when they stay with you. They will also not have to endure a long and stressful commute. \n You should demonstrate that you will be in the home when your child is there. This means that you will not regularly leave your child with a babysitter or alone while you work or are otherwise busy. Otherwise, show that you will have someone who is familiar to the child stay with him or her if you must be away from home. \n For example, if you have to work some nights that your child would be staying with you, you could show that the child’s grandparent or other relative will available to stay with the child while you are gone. \n To have custody, you must prove to be mentally and emotionally fit and physically able to take care of a child. You cannot have a physical or mental sickness that could cause you to neglect your child or put your child in danger in any way. Establish proof of good physical and mental health with a statement or medical records from your primary physician. \n Someone who is suffering from an extreme case of paranoid schizophrenia would not be able to gain custody of a child. Because of this condition, the child could be placed in a dangerous situation. \n If you do have any conditions that could interfere with your ability to be the primary caregiver for your child, you should show the court that you have taken steps to proactively address the condition. Additionally, explain why the condition will not interfere with your abilities and duties as a parent. \n For example, if you have been diagnosed with mild depression, you should disclose your medical history to the court. Explain that you regularly see a therapist and that you have been on medication for X number of years. \n You should also include information that shows that you have never put your child in danger because of a medical condition. This could simply be a statement stating “I have never put my child in danger because of my condition (whatever it is).” \n Show that you do not have issues with abuse. This includes mental, physical and sexual abuse, as well as drug and alcohol abuse. \n It’s a good idea to think about reasons that joint custody would be the best for your child. If you are worried about remembering your arguments, feel free to write them down, along with any other thoughts you have on the custody process. \n The first pretrial stage you will encounter will be discovery.During discovery, you will have the opportunity to collect facts, get witness statements, find out what the other party is going to say at trial, and get an idea of how good your case is.If you take part in informal discovery, you may conduct interviews with witnesses, collect documents, and take photographs.These are all considered informal discovery processes because they are things you can do on your own while working with cooperative people.If you need to use formal discovery, you will utilize various tools to require uncooperative parties to give you information you need.These tools include: interrogatories, which are written questions the other party must answer; depositions, which are in-person interviews with an opposing party or witness; requests for documents, which asks the other party to produce documents you want to see; and requests for admissions, which will involve you asking another party whether certain statements are true., Oftentimes, during the preliminary stages of a custody lawsuit, the court will require you and the other parent to go through a custody evaluation, which will then be submitted to the court. A custody evaluation will usually be a report, written by a professional, opining on the parenting skills and abilities of you and the other party. \n You will likely have to take part in multiple interviews, some being conducted with the other party and others being conducted alone.The evaluator will ask questions to try and determine if giving you joint custody will be in the best interests of the child. For example, you may be asked, “How do you show love for the child?”Also, you may be asked to provide the evaluator with community and school records. The evaluator may want school records, such as disciplinary violations, or a record of the community activities the child participates in. You will need to sign a release for the evaluator to access them.The evaluator may also want a “home record.” This consists of information about the child’s behavior (outgoing or withdrawn), as well discipline problems and relationships with siblings., Towards the end of your preparations for trial, you will have to schedule a time to actually conduct the trial. To do this, contact the clerk of courts and request a trial date. You may have to go in front of a judge in order to convince them that the trial date that is set will work for both parties and that everyone will be prepared. \n When your trial date arrives, get to the courthouse early. You will be required to go through a security checkpoint, which will look and feel a lot like airport security. Once you get through security, go to your courtroom and wait until your case is called. \n An important part of being successful in court involves dressing professionally. A courtroom is considered a professional and serious venue, so you need to dress that way. Always wear a suit if you have one. You should always avoid wearing shorts, sandals, and hats. \n You or your lawyer will need to give the judge a roadmap of what the evidence will show. The opening statement should be brief, but should summarize what evidence will support your claim to full custody. \n Do not engage in argument. Emotions can run high in a custody hearing, but there is nothing to argue about during the opening statement because no evidence has been admitted into court yet. \n As the petitioner (the person seeking joint custody), you will present witnesses first. The respondent (the other parent) will then have an opportunity to cross-examine each witness. \n Do not ask leading questions.A leading question states a fact and then asks the witness to agree. For example, “You never spank your child, do you?” is a leading question. Instead, the lawyer should ask a series of questions such as “How often does your son misbehave?” “Do you punish him?” “How do you punish him?” Then the attorney can ask, “Have you ever spanked your son?” \n Ask witnesses to identify any documents you want introduced into evidence. You must first elicit testimony that a document is what you claim it is before it can be admitted into evidence. \n The purpose of cross-examination is to either discredit the witness or to minimize the testimony by showing that the witness is biased or lacking in sufficient knowledge to testify about the matter. \n You can impeach a witness with a prior inconsistent statement. If a witness ever praised you as a parent, then that statement can be introduced if the witness now claims on the stand that you are a bad parent. \n If someone testifies that you and your child fight, then you can minimize the damage by highlighting how infrequently the witness sees you with your child. \n Always try to remain calm. If you feel anger overwhelming you, close your eyes for five seconds and breathe deeply. \n You or your lawyer will summarize your case, explicitly linking evidence to the best interest of the child factors provided in you state’s statute. \n Counter bad facts as best as you can. If you don’t have a clean criminal record, then concede that fact before highlighting the evidence that shows you have lived responsibly for the past several years. \n Once your trial is over, the judge will make a decision regarding your case. If you prevail, you will have obtained joint custody of your child. If you were unsuccessful at trial, you can choose to appeal the judge's decision if you think they made a mistake. \n 
 If you don’t have access to the Internet through Wi-Fi, get online by running an Ethernet cable from your computer’s LAN port to the LAN port on your router. \n Macs don’t use wireless drivers. If you’re having trouble with your Mac, see How to Fix Common Computer Network Issues for Mac. \n \n To determine the best driver for your wireless card, you will need to know what the wireless card is called. You can find that information in the Device Manager. \n The Device Manager will now appear on the screen. \n This will expand a list of all network adapters on the computer, including one that has the word "wireless" in its name.If you can't find one labeled "Wireless," right-click each driver and select "Properties." The wireless card should say “Wireless Card” under “type.” \n The wireless adapter name is at the very top of the Driver tab.An example of a wireless card name is “Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235.” \n This is where you’ll find links to download drivers for your device. \n For example, if your wireless card was made by Intel, visit www.intel.com and click “Support.” \n This is the name that you wrote down earlier. Once you find the wireless card, click the link to visit its product page. \n You may have to click a link that says “Download,” “Software,” or “Drivers” to find the download links. \n Most companies provide drivers in a “.exe” file, which makes them extra easy to download and install. \n Save the download in a location you will remember, like the Downloads folder or the Desktop. \n Now you’ll prepare to remove the current driver. \n The entry for the wireless card will now disappear from the “Network Adapters” list. \n This should launch the setup program that will install your wireless drivers.If the file ends with “.zip” instead of “.exe”, right-click the file and select “Extract All.” Select a folder to extract the files to and click “Extract.” Finally, double-click the .exe file located in the folder you selected. \n The device manager will now scan the computer for hardware without drivers installed.If a driver is found, Windows will install it automatically. To confirm that a new driver was installed, expand the list of network adapters and look for the entry for your wireless adapter. \n If a driver is not found, you may be prompted to browse for the folder where the driver files are located. Navigate to the directory to which you extracted the .zip files, then click “OK” or “Install.” \n The screens will be different depending on your system and wireless card, but you’ll usually have to agree to the manufacturer’s terms before arriving at an “Install” button. \n If the installer asks you to restart the computer once the installation is complete, click “OK” or “Restart Now” as indicated. \n To test your connection, remove the Ethernet cable from the LAN port on your computer. This ensures that you’re testing the right connection., If the drivers were the culprit, you should now be able to access wikiHow using your wireless connection. \n Try restarting the computer if you can’t connect. Then, open the Device Manager and run “Scan for new hardware” again. \n If you are still having issues, your problem may not be driver related. \n 
 Also select the options for "By Owner" and "Has Title".\n Ask if the person you are speaking to is the legal owner of the car and if they currently have the title to it. You need to speak to the owner of the vehicle. \n Ask the owner if they have documentation to prove that their vehicle would pass any such testing requirements as it sits. Ask for the expiration date on their current registration. You need to know if you'll have to shell out additional monies to bring the car up to specifications before you can register it, should you choose to purchase it. \n Open a new browser and select a service record/accident reporting service website. Key in the Vin number and check for any accidents/repairs that might indicate that the car is likely to have serious mechanical or structural problems. Look for a previous "Salvage" title on the vehicle and the most recent odometer reading. It is more difficult to register and insure a vehicle with a "Salvage" title, and a vehicle with high mileage (high odometer reading) may require more expensive maintenance and repairs in order to get it to, or keep it in roadworthy condition. \n Make sure you see the vehicle during the daytime and can spare up to an hour to examine it yourself, and have a mechanic check it over for you. \n This will afford you the opportunity to arrive early and observe the owner driving the vehicle into the lot. As they arrive, you should be looking for things like: Is there smoke coming from the vehicle? Is the vehicle making any strange knocking or ticking noises? Do the breaks or tires squeal as they turn into a parking space and come to a stop? When the owner turns the vehicle ignition off, does the car immediately stop running, or does it make odd choking/knocking noises? And finally, what does the owner do when they exit the vehicle (assuming they have not seen you yet)? Does he or she wipe down the car to ensure it looks sparkly? Or does the man or woman grab a bottle out of the car and pop the hood to top off fluids? \n Ask to see the title and registration and compare them with any inspection stickers you may find on the windshields of the vehicle. Note any discrepancies and question the owner about them. If in doubt about who the car is titled and registered to, ask for the owner's drivers license and the vehicle insurance paperwork. If there is any discrepancy, regardless of your feelings about the person or vehicle, find another car. The name should be the same (signature included) on each piece of documentation. \n Walk around the vehicle and visually inspect each tire and wheel well. Look for signs of tire weakness or failure. Run your hand over each tire, feeling for uneven tread wear. (this may indicate poor wheel alignment gone unchecked, or worse, a wracked car frame causing uneven contact between the tires and the ground). Stand at the front corner of each side of the vehicle and look down the body for indications of dents or abnormalities in the body that might indicate a previously damaged vehicle. Such indications might include: wavy body panels, inconsistencies in the paint texture or shine, inconsistent rust patterns, or a suddenly way-too-talkative owner. At the front and rear of the vehicle, kneel down and look under the vehicle. At the front, look for a different paint color or overspray consistent with the vehicle paint color. Look at the inside line between the front and back tire on each side of the vehicle for obvious alignment problems or evidence that the car has been in a frame-wracking crash. Make sure all light lenses are in good condition. At the rear of the vehicle, examine the first few inches of the tailpipe with a flashlight. Look for rust or holes, then examine the length of the pipe for defects such as missing clamps, holes, excessive rust. While you're on your knees, examine the entire undercarriage of the vehicle for rust, failing pieces (even if you're unsure what each piece actually is), and deep scrapes or scratches that indicate significant impact against the underside of the vehicle. \n Often, while you're looking closely at their vehicle, an owner who's neglected to mention problems he or she is aware of, will begin acknowledging, or even pointing out indications of an accident, repairs, or damage done to the vehicle, and provide you with details that can help you decide whether the vehicle is a good investment., Upon opening each cabin door, check to ensure that the windows and locks perform properly and that the glass is solid. Inside the driver's side door, on the frame of the vehicle, you should find a sticker with the vehicle's Vin number stamped on it; compare this number with the Vin number the owner has provided you. Examine the interior, and atop and under the seats for rust (a window, windshield or sunroof leak left unrepaired for a period of time will result in rust on the interior fabrics that is difficult to remove. If you see any, feel along the gasket of adjacent windows for signs of weakness or failure). In the trunk, look for signs of rust, loose compartments, missing or damaged spare tire/tire changing equipment. \n If you spot nothing, get up and start your examination under the hood. Look for any visible sign of a bent frame near the grill area, then examine the radiator for damage to the screen or holes. If nothing else of the engine is visible, ask the owner for any repair and maintenance records they might have and where they have their vehicle serviced. Look for indications in the records that the motor or transmission has been changed. \n Follow them to the service center and observe how the car drives and how the owner drives it. If, at leaving red lights, the owner punches it instead of driving normally, make a note to ask your mechanic to check for potential transmission problems. If the owner has to re-start the vehicle at any time during the drive, be wary. Watch for braking problems and steering problems. If the car looks like it is crabbing down the roadway, like the front and back tires are not in a straight line, the car frame needs thorough inspection for significant frame damage. \n Relate what the owner has told you about the vehicle and ask if what he or she sees is consistent with what you've been told. Ask them if they would buy the vehicle for the price the owner is asking, and how much it will likely cost you to make any necessary repairs to the vehicle. \n Take a moment to gather your thoughts and process what you've heard and seen regarding the vehicle. If, after a few moments, you feel unsure and hesitant, thank the owner and proceed no further. If, on the other hand, you are certain that this is the right car for you, at nearly the right price, return to the owner and make him or her an offer to purchase the vehicle. Use the information you've gained from your examination of the vehicle and your mechanic's advice to negotiate with the owner until you agree on a purchase amount. \n Make sure you have the title to the vehicle signed and dated by the owner and by you before you leave. Under no circumstances should anyone except you drive the vehicle from this moment forward. The owner will need to make arrangements to return him or herself home, but it would be unwise for you to accompany them, or provide them with a ride. \n

 Before the opening credits flashed, the host would generally say "On your mark...get set....Go!!!!" then a game would be played. Though the directions of this game were never formally introduced to home-viewers, by watching this game, you'd see how each of these games were played.Generally, players had to fill a beaker of water that contained a large yellow line, or toss a number of props across a line to another player on stage with a number of different games. Sometimes it would be a water relay where players would have to fill a beaker with water from a variety of items, to sometimes players having to throw and catch props that could be any number of possible items into bigger-sized mock stage-props where their teammate would be situated. Once that toss-up challenge on stage was completed, a dinging sound would be heard and the game would end. The introductory credits would then display with a loud "splash" sound as the title pane appeared. Contestants would walk up to their contestant podium to dry off and complete the rest of the game.\n This will be described below., Once dried off, the host would introduce both teams (team structure and team colors will be talked about later). He'd go over the rules. Generally, it sounded like these rules were well rehearsed and the rules never changed from episode to episode and never dropped or changed even the simple rules. The team who won the introductory round won control of the first question. The host would generally use these lines: "I'm going to ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer or think the other team hasn't got a clue, you can dare them to answer it for double the dollars. But, be careful, because they can always double dare you back for four times the amount, and then you'll have to either answer that question or take the physical challenge." )., They could answer it or pass it to the other team (or by playing strategy if they knew it but wanted more money and thought the other team might not know) - saying "Dare". The question would then fall on the other team onstage, who could answer it or pass it right back - all by saying "Double Dare". However, when it got passed back to the initial team who originally passed it (with the "Dare" response), the team could answer the question or take what's called the Physical Challenge - a short game (most games lasted no longer than 45 to 60 seconds) that utilized the team's physical traits or muscle. After several of these question-answer-challenges were asked, points were doubled and more questions were asked. After a brief set of advertisements, the show came back, and there was another toss-up round without the "on your mark" mentioning. Dollar or point values were doubled following this and were answered in the same style as before the advertisement. The team with the highest point (and later money) values on the board generally won the game and was able to go for the grand prize in what was called the 8-itemObstacle Course. \n Players would win points (and later money) for answering the questions(or for completing a physical or toss-up challenge or to the full extent). Generally, it was $10 ($20 for toss up or during Family Double Dare ($50)/Double Dare 2000 ($25 with normal questions winning $25 points upon not having a dare placed, and having won a physical challenge ($40 later escalating to $100 during Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000) there'd be money involved and control of the next question., Although Physical Challenge challenges varied, physical challenge times varied not only by the type of challenge that occurred, but by the year the episode was taped (and most often by the exact show that was shown in the series). Most often times, this challenge lasted 45 seconds but could have been changed to become longer or shorter as the challenge varied. \n Sometimes during the series run of both Super-Sloppy and Family Double Dare run, the host would mention that each physical challenge is tried with sample families and always tested to be easy enough to complete. But time and time again, some challenges are easier done off-stage than on and some challenges just didn't make the cut for some players to successfully complete. \n If the teams passed these obstacles, they'd end up winning a grand prize. If teams got partially through the obstacles, each obstacle that was successfully played, they'd win a prize for while others that weren't completely attempted never resulted in a prize won and they wouldn't be able to complete the remainder of the challenges. Players on the teams reaching this stage of the game had to win the obstacles, by finding a marked hidden red flag on the top of a pole that was as high as the obstacle allowed them to reach or in a mess of Nickelodeon rather edible liquid concoctions (such as the event The Sandwich or the pizza or the famous "In Da Nose" (where players had to reach up into a giant nose to find a flag inside the giant nostrils). Whether it was rolling down a slide filled with gooey substances (that were actually edible) to find a flag as you went down it, a ball pit-like pool (or sometimes was filled with water and mock alligator balloons) where the contestant had to make his way across to find the flag at the top of the pole or reaching down into a huge pool of colorful whipped cream that represented ice cream or one of a variety of things, as long as you were able to hand off the red triangular flag with the number of the obstacle on it to your partner who would rush from the end of your obstacle to theirs and completed theirs and switched off, completed that obstacle and handed that one off, your team would win the grand prize along with all the prizes successfully accomplished along the way. \n The obstacle course was a timed challenge. Generally, the obstacle course would last for no more than 60 seconds, though sometimes to a kid, this felt a whole lot longer... \n Although this varied by show, by the time this show became called Family Double Dare and later Double Dare 2000 (both of these you will learn about later in this article), the grand prize generally was trips to various family-fun places including sometimes Universal Studios Florida (later called Universal Orlando) (However, with this being taped at Universal Studios Florida at the time, this kind of broke the fun for the family for another separate family vacation here, when they've been in this park already.) If teams got partially through the obstacles, each obstacle they got through they'd win a prize for while others that weren't completely attempted they wouldn't win the prize for., During this show, Nickelodeon supplied players with a free T-shirt with the Double Dare, Super Sloppy Double Dare, Family Double Dare or Double Dare 2000 logo (depending on which exact year this show was being filmed). Players were given either a blue shirt or red shirt along with an interesting (and sometimes even rhythmically rhyming) name. While the blue team would stand to the host's right, the red team would stand to the host's left. Players would also be given a free pair of sneakers - most often times these were Reeboks, while at sometimes later this changed to become Nike's when the promotional product placement contract changed hands. \n During the first season of the show, all players wore red shirts, but due to a new TV game show on Nickelodeon (called Finders Keepers) in the second year, Double Dare changed their shirts so that each team wore different-colored shirts to designate the two different teams for the host to respond to so confusion didn't constantly happen. \n While watching, you'll see that during both Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, teams were composed of two kid players. When this series became Family Double Dare and was revived in 2000 (for Double Dare 2000), these teams held four players each (Family Double Dare generally contained a mother, a father and two kids who all interacted intelligently for each team.), Look for what the contestant desks looked like, along with the score-board for the team and what the stage looked like where the Physical Challenges were played. \n Although the contestant desks stood on a podium that was long enough for both players from the team to stand behind, there would be a towel rack on the left side of the desk (when watching, you'd see the towels on camera on this towel rack). \n Above the player podium, would be the players scoreboard. This scoreboard would not in any way be attached to the desks. Depending on the team colors, they would designate in digital form the numbers to the amount of money or points the team would accumulate. Each of these scoreboards would have rounded corners (on the earlier episodes these were tall triangular boards that contained a line of digital numbers for the score along with the program icon below it) and each portion of the backdrop of each number would be set on a black background. \n In between the two teams would be the host's desk that looked a bit like the contestant's desk but was meant to fit just the host. It had the picturesque icon of the Double Dare name (interconnected D's (DD)) on a plaque (placard) at the center-most portion of the host-desk. Above (in back of) the host of the show, there would be a revolving time clock. From the "waiting position" containing the interconnected DD insignia, the time clock would revolve counterclockwise around when a physical challenge was needed revolved back clockwise at the end of the stunt. \n The floor in front of the team's desks would be where the Physical challenges would be held. The floor always seemed to be spotless before a Physical Challenge was held. Depending on the wetness of the challenge, it was the stage crew's responsibility for cleaning it up while not showing themselves on camera (more on that in a minute, as there is at least one popular name that will come to mind in the fan of this show). The floor was this blue checkerboard with crisscrossing lines of greyish yellow, that was fairly large (about a quarter of the width of a given football field) \n In between the Physical challenge area and Obstacle Course, the fan would sometimes see two steps where contestants could walk down (when the camera wasn't turned on them) to get to the Obstacle course. However, these steps would never be used in any challenge, but were visible in some camera shots during the Obstacle course run. (These steps were less visible during the Double Dare 2000 taping, but were still present) \n In front of the Physical Challenge area would be a large area wider than the Physical Challenge area that held the Obstacle Course. It contained eight obstacles on the floor. In back of this and to each of the sides you'd generally see the viewer seating to watch as the episodes were taped. Also, you'd see in between the Obstacle Course and the home-viewer seating all the cameras and equipment that would make for a fantastic production number. \n Viewers who chose to take a studio tour during this time and/or go in for a taping would notice what was happening in the hallway nearby. The hallway in back of the show area contained several other obstacles that weren't being used in that day's taping, but could be used on other episodes. \n Although Marc Summers was the starred host of this show for most of the series' run (from the creation of this show in 1986 till 1993), this show was shot with him as being the host from Double Dare to Super Sloppy Double Dare till Family Double Dare and concluding in 1993. However, when Double Dare was revived in 2000, another host came up onstage instead; This host's name was the little-known Jason Harris who did little along the lines of other gameshows that were set for TV. While Marc Summers had a few other TV shows he was responsible for, following his taping on Double Dare ("What Would You Do?"), it was Double Dare that really brought Marc the fame and glory for the great name on his resume. (Marc Summers later hosted the documentary of how certain packaged food products are prepared on the Food Network show "Unwrapped".Double Dare 2000 had some of the same rules but it had several additional challenges and some changes to the Obstacle Course. \n Although the name of this article says some of it, Nickelodeon brought the viewer these games, during a programming block between 4 and 5 pm (Eastern Time). It shot and aired over 592 episodes (525 of which aired as either Double Dare (10/6/1986 - 2/19/1988), Super Sloppy Double Dare (10/6/1986 - 2/19/1988, daily) or Family Double Dare (8/13/1990 - 2/6/1993)). These aired between 1986 and 1993 as was stated before. Each of these episodes generally ran anywhere between 21 and 24 minutes (though some aired no longer than 26 minutes long, but tallying with advertisements, all episodes fit neatly into the 30 minute time block that was allotted per show. Although there were some shows (Super Sloppy Double Dare) that ran daily, each show ran only on Saturday nights on Nickelodeon. for Double Dare, Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000. (Double Dare 2000 aired between 1/22/2000 and 11/10/2000.), During a production or in the final presentation of the episode to the TV viewer, when the host mentioned the names Robin (it was rather common to hear this name on-screen), recognize that Robin Marella and Dave Shikiar (1986-1990) or even Jamie Bojanowski and Chris Mileswere all just stagehands that helped in preparation of the show and during cleanup of the production stage between the toss-up question and physical challenges, all without being seen on camera (down on their knees with off-white colored towels). Robin sometimes brought out the stage props for Physical Challenges., Although all fans of Double Dare recognize the narrators, fans should recognize three names. There was one who went by just his first name upon the program (he was called Harvey) taping, there would sometimes be heard other names of other narrators that would help out on other shows. When Family Double Dare came to air, the name "Doc Holliday" showed up as the narrator instead on some episodes of 1992 and all episodes of the 1993 airings. When Double Dare was revived for Double Dare 2000, Tiffany Phillips replaced them all and became the new narrator/announcer. \n Harvey would sometimes be seen on camera when Super Sloppy Double Dare was being taped and aired. But this wasn't normal to see his face present. \n Although the concepts remained the same when the show was brought over from Nickelodeon to the FOX Family Channel in the 1990s, the hosts differed along with the sets and overall end game and even point values/money changed in how things were set up. \n CBS also had a game show that they called Double Dare that was hosted by a very young Alex Trebek. But it had a completely different set of rules and end result for the game along with almost everything else during the game and should never be compared to the Nickelodeon game show. (These episodes air in syndication on BUZZR, and these don't generally make it much to YouTube.). \n This game theme music was called "On Your Mark" and any fan of this show will remember it from memory, though Double Dare 2000 had a revised edition of this song used during it's run. \n Also, recognize the short musical segue between the time the end of the host introducing the obstacle in the Obstacle Course and when the prize was shown. \n 
 Try to stay within this estimated budget. Then, once you’ve spent a semester or two actually homeschooling your child, revisit your original budget estimates and figure out how much you’ll actually need to spend on classes and materials, and how much money you can earn while still effectively educating your child at home. Use the actual data on your costs and earnings over the course of your first semester or two to allocate future money for classroom materials, textbooks, and so on. \n Books, pencils, and other school materials can add up quickly. Deciding on your maximum expenditure will help you manage these costs and buy cautiously when building your child’s curriculum. \n Don’t feel locked in to your budget. You should use it as a guide, but don’t worry if you go slightly over the budget. \n You might find your budget varies from year to year. \n Free or discounted materials for younger children tend to be easier to obtain than those for older children. \n Reevaluate your budget at the beginning of each school year to ensure your budget is realistic relative to your child’s needs and your finances.\n For instance, if your child and another are close in age and learning ability, you could teach them one subject, while the other parent could teach them another subject. That way, each of you will only need to invest in one set of learning materials, but your kids will have access to two different classes. \n Work together with the other parent to develop a curriculum in each class that you’re both happy with. \n This approach will also save you time, since you won’t have to prepare for the class that the other parent is teaching. \n Sharing classes can help you cut down on your budget. \n Alternately, you could just (at discounted rates) buy secondhand materials from other members. \n For instance, if your child is in the third grade, they will not need materials from their second-grade curriculum. Try to find a parent who is looking for materials for their second-grader and sell them to that parent. \n Then, locate a parent in the network whose child is a bit older and no longer has use for third-grade materials. Obtain these materials through purchase or trade. \n By obtaining all or many of the materials necessary for a certain grade level at once, you can save time. \n You can often get flashcards, books, DVDs, and learning software for free or at discounted rates from parents who no longer have use for them. \n Sharing class materials will help you keep your educational costs low. \n All you need is a marker and some notecards. Write the appropriate information on each side and you’ll have your very own set of educational flashcards. This will help you slash your budget for learning materials. \n For instance, if you’re making flashcards for a German course, write English words on one side of the card and the German translation for each word on the opposite side. Your child can use these to study. \n Junk mail is often a prime candidate for reuse in a homeschool setting. Reusing paper is not only thrifty, but eco-friendly as well. \n If possible, get unused paper with printing on just one side from friends and neighbors, too. \n These sales often offer steep discounts on notebooks, pencils, pens, and other school materials. Look for coupons that can help you score even bigger discounts at the checkout line. Getting materials on sale will help you figure out how much money your materials budget really needs. \n If you’re really patient, you can sometimes get even better deals once the school year has gotten underway. Stores will try to liquidate their surpluses by offering their school supplies at discount rates. \n Check dollar stores, office supply stores, and pharmacies for discounts on these materials. \n Getting school materials on sale is an easy way to cut back on your overall budget. \n Homeschooling often means that one parent sacrifices their career in order to homeschool their child. However, if you are that parent, you don’t necessarily need to be entirely unemployed. If you can get a job where you can work from home, you’ll still be able to provide instruction to your child and make yourself available to them if they have questions. Good employment options for a parent who homeschools include: \n graphic designer \n writer \n artist \n musician \n Many parents choose to send their kids to public schools to participate in classes with expensive materials, or classes that are best learned through interaction with other students. For instance, you might choose to send your child to public school to take, art, drama, and debate classes. Sending your child to public school for certain classes can help you cut down on your overall budget. \n 
 This source can include rain, well, spring, sea, river snowmelt or pond water. Water which covers an area of 21 by 21 feet (6.5 by 6.5m) is generally regarded as large enough to gather pure water., Water that may have bodily fluids from animals or humans is also unacceptable. Discolored water should not be used. \n Make sure to use safe water to perform this ritual; in some warmer areas of the world, water may contain naegleria fowleri, an amoeba that, if inhaled into the nostrils, can cause a rare but usually fatal type of brain infection. The CDC has guidelines on how this type of ritual ablution can be done safely. , You should perform Ghusl with water as soon as you find a water source., It does not matter if you engaged in sexual intercourse or not - it is also required after unlawful acts and after wet dreams. Ghusl is not required for discharging madhiy (urethral fluid) which sometimes seeps out after thinking of or desiring intercourse - wudhu is sufficient in this case. \n This extends to bleeding after childbirth. If there is no bleeding after childbirth, it should be performed on the 40th day after childbirth. \n Those who died in Jihad don’t require Ghusl. \n This is preferred but not required. \n When a disbeliever is converted to Islam. \n Before Friday Prayer. \n Before Eid Prayers. \n After washing a corpse. \n Before undertaking a pilgrimage to Makkah. \n The intention is inside your heart and saying it verbally is recommended. \n \n Wash your right hand up to and including your wrists. Rub between the fingers and repeat three times.. \n Repeat three times. Remove all traces of semen (men) or vaginal discharge on the private parts with water and rubbing of the hands. \n Take water from the clean source and pour it into your mouth. Swirl it inside your mouth and spit it out. \n Depending upon your preference, you can repeat this three times. \n Blow the water out into your left hand. Repeat three times. \n Wash it three times from your hairline to your chin and jawbone. Extend the washing from ear to ear. \n Men should wash their beard. They can take a handful of water below the chin and rub it through the beard. Drag the wet fingers through the beard once. \n Repeat with the left arm. \n If men or women have braided hair, they should wet the base of the braids and hair. If they can’t wet the base, they should un-plait the hair. \n Repeat with the left side. \n Rub every portion of your body with the water to ensure your entire body is clean. \n Wash the feet, right then left, up to the ankles. Make sure to pour water between the toes and rub with your little finger. \n Ensure you wash the soles of the foot. \n All washing should be completed three times. \n Don’t delay in covering your body. As long as the entire body was washed three times in this order, you are considered eligible to perform Salah.
 If not, then go to http://www.blender.org to download it.\n Click on it, then choose "Blender Game". This is the Blender Game Engine. You can only use physics when you are in the BGE. \n Mouse over it and scroll with the scroll wheel all the way to the right of the bar. Click on the Bouncing Ball icon. This will open up the Physics options. \n An orange outline will appear around it. \n Choose Rigid Body. This will change the cube into a rigid object that is affected by physics. \n This will disallow it from deactivating when it has stopped moving., Then set the Margin to 0.000. \n You do not have to change the drop-down menu (which has "Box" currently selected) for the cube you are adding physics to is a box. If you are adding physics to a sphere, change it to "Sphere", and if a cylinder, then change it to "Cylinder" and so on. \n The cube should begin falling, but will never stop. We want it to stop at some point. Press ESC to end the simulation. We are going to create a ramp below the cube so that it will hit it and slide down. \n Then with the cube selected, press G on your keyboard to be able to move it. Then press Z to lock the movement to the Z axis (going up or down)., Press the left-mouse button when you are done. \n Many options and submenus will appear below it. \n Click on Plane. A plane is a flat surface with four vertices. For this mesh, you do not have to set the Physics options to Rigid Body, because if you do, it will move downwards like the cube, and the cube will never come in contact with it. Instead, leave it as Static, meaning it will stay in place. \n When you are happy, press the left-mouse button. \n We want the ramp to be at only a slight angle, so now type 15 on your keyboard to rotate it by 15°. \n The cube should fall and collide with the plane, then slowly slide down and begin falling again. Press ESC to end the simulation. \n
 This does not mean being unrealistic, or saying you're going to go professional within a year. Instead, you should take a look at what you are, and figure out where you think you would like to be. Give yourself a suitable amount of time to achieve that goal, and break it down into smaller parts if the goal is especially big.\n Being good at sports means more than physical strength and speed. In order to be truly great, you need to apply that positive attitude to the way you treat other players, even if they're on the other team. If you lose a match, accept the loss and show respect to the other player for their victory.If you set an example of good sportsmanship, you'll receive the same respect in turn when you win. \n No matter what you do, skills are often slow to build. There is always going to be someone who can do it better than you, at least at first. Impatient athletes tend to make poor ones. If you're not patient, you will try to leap into more advanced techniques long before you're ready. Your motivation will sap away when you don't see improvement immediately. Keep the long-term goal in mind, and hang tight in the meantime while you make it a reality. \n When you play sports, you will inevitably receive criticism. Whether from a coach, other players, or spectators, you need to take most of it with a grain of salt. Are they angry because you missed a pass, or do they sincerely want to help you improve? Learn to distinguish the constructive criticism from the hurtful remarks. In a lot of cases, you can use criticism as motivation to get better in whatever area they bring up. \n Don't let yourself get defensive.Your thinking becomes more limited if you allow yourself to become emotional against criticism. \n One of the biggest reasons people join sports teams in the first place is to make friends with new people.If you join a team, you're bound to run into a lot of people. Chances are you'll develop friendships with at least some of them. Making these friendships a priority is a good move if you want to become great at sports. You can practice together on your own time. The morale boost of playing with friends helps as well. \n Team sports like soccer can have some skills practiced in solitude, but for others (like goalkeeping and passing) another person is needed. It's helpful to have this other person as a friend. It'll make the practice process more enjoyable in the long term. \n It's possible to get so obsessed with being good at something that you lose track of why you want to be good in the first place. Not taking the time to enjoy the sport you play results in a fast burnout. Whether you're practicing or playing a competition, try to remember the other reasons why you play sports. This may include the natural satisfaction you get from exercise, or quality time spent with friends., If you want to become a sports superstar, joining a team is a good way to start. Even if your skills are currently low, joining an amateur league will sharpen up your skills. Sports teams are everywhere, and most of them are free to join. If you go to school, you should go for team tryouts when they're happening. Recreation centres are often host to sports teams as well.If you're not in school, you can find or start a sports club online., Great coaches come in all shapes and sizes.Certain coaching personalities will suit you better than others. The best scenario is having a coach who genuinely wants to see you succeed. In the early stages, enthusiasm is often more helpful than scientific know-how. \n Across the board, communication skills are the most important trait a coach can have.There are different levels of sports coach. Most after-school coaches are volunteers with a working knowledge of the sport and enthusiasm for the game. You can hire a sports coach with full training and education, although it will set you back a lot of money., If you want to be truly great at sports, it's not enough to focus on a couple of sports alone. It is important to set your sights wide with your exercises. Don't specialize in skills unless you're already a great athlete. Find ways to train every part of your body. Whether this means playing multiple sports or doing an all-encompassing exercise routine, training your entire body will boost your sports performance. \n There's a lot of evidence to suggest that athletes are better if they play more than one sport., it's a common misgiving for young athletes to want to jump into the advanced stuff quickly. This isn't an effective way to spend training time. You need a solid bedrock foundation before you move on to bigger things.If you're new to a sport, take as much time as you need to get the basic movements down properly. It will make advanced skills a lot easier to grasp in the long run. \n Some argue that fundamental "movement skills" (such as jumping and kicking) should be mastered properly before moving on to applied sports skills., In an actual competition, things aren't usually going to play exactly by the books. While you're practicing, you'll usually be playing under optimal circumstances. In order to make sure you'll be up for the unforeseen challenges, you need to predict the conditions of the competition.Ask yourself if you are learning a skill, or if you're learning to actually use that skill in the competitions you'll be in. \n Remember this motto: "Train the way you want to play."There's no way to perfectly replicate a competition in practice, but playing with other people can get you used to the scenarios you'll need to beware of. \n It is common for bodies to adapt to a level of strain. Progress will slow down if you don't keep upping the stakes as you go along. Bodybuilders and strength-oriented athletes do this by increasing their reps or the weights they work with. As a competition athlete, the best thing you can do to keep progress going is to practice the skills while under fatigue.Studies have shown that skill execution goes out the window when you get tired, so it's a good idea to practice under those conditions. \n Building up your speed is important too. Speed usually comes with practice, but you shouldn't try to rush into speed until you have the basics down pat., If you're wondering at what point a skill becomes mastered, it is when you're able to do it automatically and without thinking. This is called the autonomous phase, and it's where you want to be at if you want to play sports competitively.Given enough time and repetition, a skill will eventually fall under this category. When you're in the fray of a game, you won't have time to think everything through, so practice until it's all automatic, so you'll know you're ready. \n When you're playing a sport like football in a competition, you're going to potentially need to throw a ball while getting chased by several competitors. You can't replicate this stress in private practice, so you have to make sure your tosses perfected beforehand. \n Keep practicing. Practice is never something that should stop. even if you become great at sports, you can always become better. If you stop practicing, chances are that someone more determined will beat you. \n The best athletes know that training doesn't stop at sports skills. You want your body to be as sharp as it can be for whatever sport you're playing. On the downtime away from sports, keep your body in general shape by going to the gym. Although it may seem daunting or expensive, it is absolutely worth the investment if you want to be good at sports. There are lots of benefits to going to a gym. As you'll know from playing in sports teams, exercising with others is very motivating.Do some research into a prospective gym before you pay for a membership. Go for a tour, and ask for details. Make sure the gym fits the circumstances of your life before you make your first payment., This is especially true during times of intense practice or training, where things get so busy it becomes hard to cram everything into a regular day. Nonetheless, your body needs its full rest. At least 6 hours is good, but 8 will ensure your body's had its full time to regenerate. \n Everyone should make a point of eating a diet that benefits their body. This is especially true if you want to be great at sports. Eating junk food will work against whatever efforts you make n the gym. Base your diet on leafy greens and legumes.Cut back on "empty calories" (like soda) and replace them with things that improve your health. \n If you're lactose intolerant, try going without dairy. It may sound hard, but you'll see benefits within a month. \n As a general rule, the more you drink it, the better you'll feel. Water regulates everything, and you should expect to lose some of your natural hydration via sweat while you exercise. The common "8 glasses a day" guideline isn't mandatory, but you should try to keep water next to you whenever you can. It's especially important to stock up on water while you're exercising. \n Keep a refillable bottle of water around with you. Refill it when it goes empty. You'll find your water consumption goes up a lot if you simply keep it near you. \n Drugs and alcohol aren't recommended if you want to be great at sports. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it drains your body of hydration.Your body will expend resources trying to get rid of the alcohol, and it can have a negative impact on your sports performance for days after the fact. \n In the long run, the amount of calories you digest from alcohol like cider and beer can have a negative impact on your gut., The competition will be stiff enough, so it's not worth it losing your edge just because you weren't willing to sleep at least 8 hours. \n While it wouldn't be regularly recommended in a diet, athletes should load up on their carbohydrate intake.Carbs essentially give your body energy, and you'll need lots of energy if you're playing a sports competition. \n Stay away from sugar for a few hours before a big competition. Sugar and starches dehydrate your body. That is something you want to avoid in the midst of competing.Keep yourself up to pace with snacks.Longer matches will be a test of endurance, and something as simple as an energy bar can mean a big difference. \n Warm ups are important for any physically strenuous activity. They can be fairly light, but a proper warm up will help prevent early exhaustion and injury. Aim to warm up around half an hour before the start of the game.Stretch out your arms and legs. Run in place. Work up a bit of a sweat. This will get your body in the right mode for the competition. \n Warm ups also help fight off anxiety. Pre-game anxiety can be an issue for some players, so you should keep that in mind if it's something you suffer from. \n Having a good idea what to expect with the opposing side is important, regardless whether you're going one on one or playing as a team. If you want to know which techniques you should be using in the midst of certain competitors, it's a good idea to study their methods in the days and weeks before a big game. If there is any footage of those players during a game, give it a shot. \n The science of analytics turns the respective skills of your teammates and competitors into a sharp formula.Matching each player to their best strengths is integral to a team's success. Professional sports analysts make it their specific business to analyze the sporting behaviour of athletes. \n Life is always complicated, and there may be things in your personal life that are bothering you. However, at least for the course of the game, you can't let any of that stuff get to you. It may be easier said than done, but if winning the game means enough to you, it should be a straightforward matter to keep your eyes on the prize. \n A lot of the best athletes may have had a natural aptitude for it, but the reason they ultimately succeed is because they want victory more than any of the competition. That's a tricky thing to develop inside yourself, but if the desire is intense enough, you will do just about anything to make your dreams a reality. This broadly applies to the mindset of training, but it's incredibly important during a competition. How much you want to win will have an effect on how far you end up pushing yourself. Sometimes, the distance between winning and losing is very small. A world of difference is made from that added bit of effort. Passion is the key to most kinds of success, and the same applies to sports. \n 
 Brown leopard print material works well, but you could use non-toxic fabric paints to make your own pattern if you wish.\n Remember to have the cloth back to back so that you have both sides of a giraffe, rather than two right sides or two left sides of a giraffe. In other words, the two sides will be "mirror images" of each other. \n Use it to cut the fabric as in the previous step. \n \n Note: You may need to use a seam ripper to adjust the length of the top seams if the belly pieces are not lining up well at this point. \n Too little stuffing will prevent the giraffe from standing up on its own. \n This particular project utilizes four thicknesses of floss (6 strands each). \n Pull floss through. \n Pull floss through. \n Tie floss in a knot. \n Tie floss in a knot. \n Tie ends of floss for "horn knobs" \n Tie ends of floss for "horn knobs". \n Completed "horns" \n Completed "horns" are shown. \n Knot the tail twice, once near the body and once at its end. \n Knot the tail twice, once near the body and once at its end. Alternatively, you could knot the tail on the rump and braid it for an inch or so before knotting at the end and clipping the excess length off. \n Display proudly or give to a friend to double your enjoyment of the giraffe. \n 
 Driving in a highly populated metropolitan area is very different from those dirt roads out in the country where no one is around. Try to notice how people drive, what habits people seem to have, and what people do in response to certain situations.\n Unfortunately bumper-to-bumper traffic is often stop-and-go instead of moving along at a stead slow pace. \n First of all, go the speed of traffic. It is very dangerous to be going 35 mph (56 km/h) on the interstate when everyone else is going 70 -- plus it blocks traffic up, and people won't thank you for it. \n Other drivers can't read your mind -- they have to rely on things like your turn signal to know what you're going to do. If you are turning, put on your signal about 10 car lengths before you plan to turn. Always use your signal when you're changing lanes, and check, double-check, and triple-check to make sure there is a spot open before you change lanes. \n This is common sense; it is safer to go on another block and turn around, and it's not going to cost you more than a minute or two. \n Not only is it rude to try to speed up to pass them, it can also be dangerous. \n It is EXTREMELY rude, and you could find yourself in a rear-end collision, which would be YOUR fault. \n This is common sense and it can mean the difference between a preventable wreck or a safe commute. \n Everyone is trying to get to some different place, and people are usually more preoccupied with their own lives than looking at other drivers. \n If they do, try to figure out what you may have done that prompted it and try to change this behavior. Realize that the person may have just been having a bad day, and let it go. \n
 When you first wake up in the morning, your legs have been slightly elevated or at least horizontal. As a result, your legs are likely not as swollen as they might be later in the day. This will make it easier to put on compression stockings.Try elevating your legs while you sleep by resting your feet on a pillow. You can also slightly tilt the foot of your mattress upward by putting a 2x4 piece of wood underneath the mattress end.\n If your legs have any moisture on them, you might not be able to pull up the compression stockings. Sprinkle talcum powder or cornstarch on your feet and calves to absorb any excess moisture., One of the easiest ways to put on compression stockings is to turn the top part of the sock inside out. You’ll want to leave the toe of the sock right side out. Reach into the stocking and grip onto the toe., Pinch the toe so that it stays right side out while pulling the top of the stocking down over your arm. This will result in the top being inside out. \n Carefully slide the stocking off your arm so that the top remains inside out while the toe is ready for your foot. \n Putting on compression stockings can be difficult, especially if you have trouble reaching your feet. Try sitting down on a chair or on the side of the bed so that you can bend down to reach your feet. \n Wearing gloves will make it easier to grip onto the stockings and pull them up. Choose latex gloves such as those worn by healthcare professionals, or similar type gloves. Dishwashing gloves will also work., Slide your toes into the end of the sock and align the sock so that the toe of the sock is even and straight. \n As your toe holds the bottom of the sock in place, pull the bottom of your sock over your heel so that your entire foot is inside the sock. \n Use your palms to draw the stocking up and over your calf. The inside-out top part of the sock will roll upward to be right-side out. Your gloved hands will be able to grip the sock better than a bare hand. \n Do not pull at the top of the sock to get it up your leg. This will likely rip the sock. \n Make sure to keep the sock straight and smooth while you bring it over your calf. Smooth out any wrinkles as you go. \n If you are wearing knee-high compression stockings, they should come up to a point 2 finger widths below your knee.Some compression stockings go up to the top of the thigh. \n If your doctor has prescribed compression stockings for both legs, follow these instructions to put the sock on your other foot. Try to have the stockings come up to the same point on both legs. \n Some prescriptions may only require a compression stocking for one leg., If your doctor recommends that you wear compression stockings to improve blood flow, then it’s likely you’ll need to wear them every day. Otherwise, it can be difficult to get them on your feet.Take off your compression stockings when you go to bed every night. \n If you have trouble reaching your feet or putting on your compression stockings, you might benefit from using a sock aid. This is a device or frame that resembles a foot shape. Put the sock over the device and slide your foot into the device. Then remove the device and your sock will be properly placed on your foot., If you are having trouble putting on your compression stockings because your feet or legs are swollen, try elevating your feet above your heart for 10 minutes. Lie down on your bed with your feet resting on a pillow, Before you go to bed, remove your compression stockings. This will give your legs a rest and will also give you a chance to wash your stockings. \n Gently pull down at the top of the sock with two hands. This will pull the sock down your calf so that the sock is inside out again. Remove the stocking from your foot., If you are having trouble getting the stockings off your ankles or feet, especially if you can’t reach your feet very well, try using a medical dressing stick to grip onto the compression sock and push it off your foot. This does require some arm strength, which can be difficult for some people., Hand wash your stockings with laundry soap and warm water. Wring out excess water by rolling your stockings in a towel. Hang them up to dry.Try to get at least two pairs of compression stockings, so you can have one pair to wear while the other is being laundered. \n Leg pain and/or swelling can be uncomfortable to live with, and compression stockings might make your legs feel better. Talk with your doctor to see if this option will reduce your discomfort.If you have poor blood flow in your legs, compression stockings are not the right choice. \n Your doctor will check to see if you have varicose veins, venous leg ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in a deep vein), or lymphedema (leg swelling). If one of these conditions is present, your doctor may prescribe compression stockings for you. \n You may need to wear compression stockings daily for up to two years., Almost one-third of pregnant women will develop varicose veins,which are veins typically in the legs and feet that have enlarged because of increased pressure in your veins.Wearing compression stockings can make your legs more comfortable and will promote blood circulation. \n Ask your doctor if compression stockings will help your condition. \n In some cases, compression stockings will be prescribed for patients post-surgery to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), or the formation of blood clots in your veins. If your post-surgery recovery restricts your mobility or requires extended bed rest, your doctor may prescribe compression stockings., While research about the health benefits of wearing compression stockings during exercise is mixed, recovery time after exercising is decreased as blood flow is improved.Many runners and other athletes now wear compression stockings either during exercise or afterwards. It is up to you whether you find them comfortable enough to wear. \n These are usually sold as compression socks, and are available at sporting goods stores and other athletic supply stores. \n The compression in the stockings is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).Your doctor will give you the proper pressure grade of stockings so that you are getting the proper treatment. \n Compression stockings are available in varying lengths, including knee-high and ones that reach the top of the thigh. Ask your doctor which length you need. \n Your legs will need to be measured so that you know the proper size of compression stockings to get. Your doctor may measure your legs; if not, a clerk at a medical equipment supply store should be able to help you., Locate your local medical equipment shop and verify that they carry compression stockings. \n Compression stockings are also available through some online retailers. It is preferable to visit a professional to get fitted for the proper compression stockings, but if this is not an option, try shopping online for stockings. \n Some health insurance plans will cover compression stockings.You will likely need a doctor’s prescription for these stockings to be covered. \n 
 Many people have this idea of “the one” as being this perfect, god-like person who will solve all of your problems and make every day of your life a fairy tale. However, the real way to know if you’re with “the one” is to see that you’re with a person you love whose flaws you are able to accept. If you’re able to deal with the loud belching, the bad taste in music, or the messiness of the man you’re with instead of cringing every time he does something you deem imperfect, then he’s the one. \n This doesn’t mean that you can’t talk about having him change some of his flaws, like learning to clean up better. But if he’s not the one, then you probably can’t stand his imperfections.\n If you’re with the one, it doesn’t mean you’ll be feeling butterflies 24/7, contrary to what you may think. However, if he’s really not the one for you, then you won’t feel a thing when you get ready to meet him or come home to him. You should feel a sense of excitement and expectation when you’re about to see him or spend time with him if he’s the one. \n If you don’t feel any kind of joy about seeing him, then you may be looking at him more as a friend, or may just have gotten bored with him. \n The next time you get ready to see him, ask yourself how excited you are. Does your heart race a little? Have you been looking forward to it all day? You don’t have to be over-the-moon happy every single time you hang out, but it should be something you look forward to for sure. \n If he’s the one, then you should already be thinking about living the rest of your life with him, whether this means getting married, having kids, and all the traditional things, or if it means being life partners and exploring life together. If you look forward a few years, or even think about what you’ll be doing next summer, and can’t imagine him being by your side, then you know he’s not the one. \n Another sign that he’s not the one is that he’s never mentioned a future with you in it. If he gets nervous or changes the subject every time you bring up the future, then it’s a sign that he’s not serious about you. \n Try to imagine your life in ten years, as crazy as that may sound. Does it seem impossible to picture him by your side, or not by your side? If you absolutely can’t see it, then he’s not the one. \n If he’s the one, then you should feel like you’re able to be yourself around him, instead of having to dress up or fit a certain role in his life. You should be able to look like yourself, talk like yourself, and express your views without worrying that you’ll upset or disappoint him. Though you can feel a little bit nervous just because you like him, you know he’s not the one if you’re constantly stressed out, anxious, or worrying about how he feels about you. \n If you’re constantly worried that something you say will upset him or set him off, then he’s not the one. \n If he’s the one, then you should feel comfortable telling him the truth, whether this means where you’ve been or what your worries about the relationship are. You shouldn’t feel like every little thing you tell him will make him angry, jealous, moody, or just reserved. If he really cares for you, then you should feel like you can tell him anything without making you feel afraid or anxious. If he makes you feel scared every time you want to tell him what’s really on your mind, then he’s not the one. \n If you feel like you have to lie to protect him or to keep him from getting angry, then he’s not the one. \n If you feel like you can open up to him about your doubts and that he will listen and take you seriously, then he may be the one. \n You can sit down with your best friends and family members and you can go down a million checklists about whether or not he’s the one, but in the end, you’re the only person who can figure this one out. It can be helpful to turn to sources like wikiHow for advice, but at the end of the day, you’ll be the only person to know if the guy is not the one, no matter what anyone else says. \n Remember that what is perfect for your best friend or favorite aunt may not be great for you; people can help you, but they can’t make the decision for you because you’re different people with different needs. \n However, one sign that he may not be the one is that you’re on this page. If you’re already having your doubts about whether or not he’s the one, then you may have a problem. \n As corny as it sounds, you’ll know whether or not he’s the one in your gut. It’s an intuitive feeling that you sometimes can’t explain. There may be a chance that you already know he’s wrong for you in your gut, but are looking for confirmation. \n Everyone flirts a little bit here and there, and if you flirt every once in a while in a harmless way, it’s not the end of the world. However, if your man is constantly flirting with other girls, talking about other girls, and disrespecting you by checking other girls out, then he’s just not the one. You can’t make excuses for him and can’t convince yourself that he doesn’t mean anything by it; if he really cared about you, then he would never show this type of behavior. \n It goes without saying that if he cheats on you, then he’s not the one. It’s one thing if he cheated once and deeply regretted it and you’re working to forgive him and another if he’s a serial cheater. If he repeatedly cheats on you, then the sooner you get out, the better. \n Even if he doesn’t cheat on you and it doesn’t go past flirting, the fact that he would do it in front of you or in front of your friends is a sign of major disrespect. \n If he’s the one, then he should be proud to show you off, to hold your hand or have his arm around you in public, and to spend time with you when he’s also with his friends or family. If he always makes up excuses about hanging out in public or having you meet his friends, then he’s not looking for a serious relationship. If he’s eager to hang out in your bedroom but won’t go to the movies with you, then he’s not the one. \n Don’t make excuses for him or think he’s really busy when he doesn’t want to go out with you. If he really cared, he’d make the effort. \n If you’ve been seeing each other for a long time and he’s never mentioned going out and meeting his friends, then he doesn’t take you seriously. \n Of course, this doesn’t mean that you should make him change who he is, but that, if there’s certain behavior you’d like him to change, such as flirting with other girls or not calling you back, that he should be willing to do that for you. If he’s stubborn and absolutely refuses to change in ways that would make him a more caring, considerate boyfriend, then he’s not the one. \n It’s not easy for a man to change, but he should at least be open to a conversation about it. If he gets angry if you even mention something you’d like him to change, then he’s not the one. \n If he’s the one, then he should respect your love for running, your hard work in nursing school, or all the time you spend writing songs. He doesn’t have to participate in all of these hobbies, but he should ask you about them and be impressed that you’re putting in the effort and that you care so much. If he’s the one, then he should be appreciative of the person who you are and the person you want to be. \n If he puts down your hobbies and makes you feel like they’re not important, then he’s not the one. \n If he puts down your goals and makes you feel like you can’t achieve them, then he’s not the one. \n This is one of the most important signs that he’s just not the one. If he can’t go an hour without lying to you and you find yourself constantly catching him in a lie, then he’s not the one. If he lies about everything from where he’s been to what he had for lunch, then it’s a sign that he’s keeping secrets from you and that he can’t be trusted. If he lies to you, then he’s just not the one. \n If you have evidence that he’s been lying and he denies it when you call him out on it, then that’s a red flag, too. \n If he respects you, then he should give you his honesty instead of making you look like a fool. Think about it. If he was really the one, would he feel the need to be dishonest? \n If he’s really the one, then he’ll be there for you when the going gets tough just as much as he would when you were having the time of your life. If he’s there for the parties and the fun road trips and falls off the radar the second your grandmother gets sick, then there’s no excuse for it—he’s just not the one. True love means being with a person through the good times and the bad, and if he flees the scene every time you’re struggling, then he’s not the one. \n Sure, he may be the perfect gentleman when you’re on a fun date or just chatting over the phone. But if he has nothing to say or has to go when you’re having a family crisis or lost your job, then he’s not the one. You can find someone who will be there for the hardship, too. \n If your man is abusive, then there are no ifs, ands, or buts about it—you have to get out of the relationship, and fast. There is no making excuses like, “He’ll never do it again” or “He really loves me, he just has a lot of problems,” when it comes to physical or emotional abusive. If he puts a hand on you and hurts you, then he is definitely not the one, and you should get out of the relationship as soon as you can. \n Nobody said it was easy to leave a man who is abusive, especially if you’re afraid of leaving him. However, you need to talk to your friends and family and get some help in leaving him as soon as you can and as safely as possible. \n If he’s the one, then you should come to think of him as your best friend, as the person that you can tell anything and the one you feel the most comfortable opening up to. If this is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, then you should feel this way. Of course, if you have many close friends, then it can take a while to get here, but this is the feeling you have about him. \n If you feel like he’s your romantic partner but like you can’t really open up to him, then he’s not the one. \n Everyone has communication problems, but if you feel like you and the guy can barely talk to each other without fighting or misunderstanding each other, then he’s not the one. If he gets angry every time you try to have a serious conversation, then he’s not the one, because he’s not willing to have an open, honest relationship with you. \n If you avoid bringing up serious topics or things that are bothering you because you know he won’t do anything about it, then he’s not the one. \n If you feel like he barely listens to you or even looks at you when you try to tell him something important, then he’s not the one. \n You may not think this a big deal when you first start dating each other, but once you’ve been together for a long time, it’s important that your man gets along with your friends and family. These are the closest people to you and they share at least some of your values, and if he can’t get along with a single one of them and doesn’t even try, then he’s not the one. \n Of course, it may not be possible for him to get on with your friends and family 100%, and there may be a few people he just can’t click with. You may also have a particularly difficult family to please, and that’s fine. The most important thing is that he makes an effort—if he doesn’t get along with the people you care about and seems fine with it, then he’s not the one. \n The best part about being in a meaningful relationship with your soul mate is that you really do complete each other in some way and make each other feel better when you’re together. Your man should make you feel like a better person and should encourage you to grow and reach your potential. If you feel like he puts you down and makes you worse instead of better, then he’s not the one. \n Think about how you’ve changed since meeting him. Have you become more driven, more motivated, or just a happier person, or have you started feeling more down on yourself and less capable of fulfilling your potential? If he’s slowed you down, then he’s not the one. \n Of course, it’s important that you encourage him to be better, too. \n If you want to spend the rest of your life with this person, then you have to make sure you see eye to eye on a lot of things. This doesn’t mean you have to share the same religion or the same political affiliation, and there’s something to be said for opposites attracting, but if you feel like his take on the world is so different from yours that you can’t see eye to eye on a single thing, then he’s not the one. \n If you’re a true optimist and he is always complaining and bringing you down and can’t find something to be happy about, then he can still be the one, but you have to ask yourself if this is something you’re willing to take for the rest of your life. \n If you believe in charity and helping others, while he thinks it’s a waste of time, then you have to think about how important this is to you. \n Though political affiliation alone isn’t a reason for a break-up, if being a liberal is very important to you and is a big part of who you are, then you may need to ask yourself if you want to spend the rest of your life who is opposed to so many of your ideas. \n This is the bottom line. If he’s the one, then he should love and appreciate the person who you are. He shouldn’t tell you he wishes you were skinnier, dressed more sexy, talked less, or stopped doing the things you care about. Though you can work on growing together and addressing your mutual flaws, he should like who you are at your core and should encourage you to be the person you want to be instead of trying to change you. \n If he doesn’t really get you, criticizes you for having opinions or wanting things that are different from what he wants, then he’s just not the one. \n If you find yourself trying to change just to please him, then he’s not the one. \n If he doesn’t give you the basic respect you deserve, then he is not the one. \n 
, Add a teaspoon of olive oil, and lightly brown the onions and pine nuts. Be careful not to burn as they will be cooked again into the meat. Remove onions and pine nuts and let cool., Take a handful of meat, like you were making a hamburger patty and mix onions, pine nuts, bulgar and spices into the meat. Very similar to seasoning hamburgers or any other types of meat. Keep rolling the ingredients and press the meat lightly together as it’s sometimes difficult to mix these ingredients into your lamb or beef. The size of each kibbeh “patty” is to your own choice, but keep in mind the thicker the meat, the longer the time it takes to cook., This recipe is clearly not the only means of cooking kibbeh. Be reminded this is only one method., Take about four patties of meat, or however many your pan will contain, and begin to pan fry the patties., However, if its turning black or smoking, or smells like its burning, you are obviously running the meat and need to lower the heat of the oven or add more oil for moisture., Let cool, but serve while its still hot. Often kibbeh is served with plan yogurt, or homemade style yogurt that dates back centuries., Often the hardest part is gathering all the materials together. Be reminded that appearance is not essential for this kind of food, granted you do not want to look unappetizing or spoiled, but taste is much more important. Be patient when cooking these foods, and take your time. Perhaps try making each dish separately before taking the ambition to cook all four recipes all at once. Or make it an evening affair and invite your friends over to try something new. But, once you are accustomed to the routine and demand of cooking and baking Lebanese cuisine, you will have no problems adjusting to other styles of Mediterranean foods and become eager to know more.
 Get a #2 yellow pencil, an eraser, a ruler, a compass or varied round objects such as dishes to use as a circle templates.\n You can use watercolors of any type, tubes or dry pads, an array of watercolor brushes, a water bucket, a piece of old terry toweling to hold supplies, and tissues or napkins. \n  This will guarantee fresh, dark, ink that won't skip or disappear halfway through your project.  If your design has small, complicated areas, also purchase a black Sharpie with a tip that is pointed. \n  Hold the paper either horizontally or vertically and using a ruler, draw a light pencil line, dividing your paper into four equal quarters.  These light lines will help keep you on track and will assist you in keeping all lines straight. \n  Pick something that is meaningful to you and draw it in the center of the paper, any size you wish. Draw it free hand or use stencils from the art store. \n Use a ruler, and drop horizontal and vertical lines to surround and outline the central figure.  Work symmetrically, having the shapes the same on both sides of the center line.  Divide all of those spaces again, breaking them into smaller shapes, if you wish. \n  Use plates, saucers, cups, etc. as templates to get rounded shapes.,  Always try to use the biggest brush possible to cover an area on your work. Premix tube paints thoroughly on the palette with enough water to make it easily spreadable, but retaining the illusion of luminosity. Have your paint transparent enough so the white of the paper shines through.,  You can do random colors or devise a color plan, keeping the painted shapes symmetrical, or the same color on both sides.  There is no correct or right way to work the window panes.  Just enjoy playing with beautiful colors and making a pleasing array of colors. \n  This will give bold dividing lines similar to the leading in stained glass. Do this freehand. Go slowly and follow the guide lines you drew initially. Use the sharp pointed Sharpie marker for details. Look on the internet for stained glass watercolors to see how to break up larger areas of color into smaller shapes. \n  If any section needs enriching, repeat with a second coat or layer of the same or another color. Just remember to keep it sheer so the white of the paper shows through.,  Pat the section dry.  Always bear in mind to work for the illusion of light coming through the window.  If you remove too much, simply dry the piece and retouch more color onto an area. \n 
 Some symptoms of a concussion can occur immediately after your injury, such as losing consciousness (“blacking out”), nausea, headache or a feeling of pressure in the head, dizziness, confusion, and ringing in the ears.However, sometimes you feel fine immediately after an injury, and symptoms do not begin until hours or even days later. If you hit your head, fall, or jar your head or neck like with whiplash, immediately stop what you’re doing and do not return to activity that day. \n Do not try to walk or stand immediately after your injury, unless you are in immediate physical danger. Rest seated or lying down until you know you can move without feeling ill. \n Athletes, usually hockey and football players, must be medically evaluated before returning to play.\n If you feel weak on one side of your body, are vomiting continuously, are confused or anxious, have neck pain, or are very drowsy, call for immediate medical care. Severe symptoms like these may indicate a more severe brain injury. \n Someone may have to call for help for you if you are unable. \n If you have neck or head pain, do NOT move until help arrives. Injuries that cause concussions can also result in spinal injuries, which can cause permanent damage. \n Even if you had minimal discomfort immediately after your injury, you should get medical help right away if your symptoms worsen in the next few hours or days. You may have a headache that gets worse and worse, begin to feel clumsy or start to stumble, get progressively dizzier, or feel confused or have problems with speech., Unless you had epilepsy before your injury and have frequent seizures, having a seizure after getting a concussion may indicate a serious problem. Don’t wait to get medical attention.Post-traumatic seizures are those that occur one week after the brain injury. Post-traumatic seizures are common in those who suffer from a severe traumatic brain injury, especially those that have an intracranial hemorrhage. \n In general, your pupils (the black centers of your eyes) should be the same size. If one pupil becomes larger than the other, it may indicate a neurological condition. Go to your doctor right away., Even if you did not lose consciousness or experience immediate symptoms, see your doctor after any head injury. They will be able to evaluate you for other injuries that may have occurred, assess the severity of your symptoms, and give you further treatment advice. They may refer you for a CT scan or an MRI so they can rule out other brain injuries.Bring a friend or loved one with you to the appointment to take notes and help you later. You might have trouble concentrating and need reminders.Sometimes your doctor may refer you to other specialists, like a neurologist if you’re having severe symptoms or problems with your nerves, or a chiropractor or physical therapist to help with pain from your car accident, for instance. \n Young children can get concussions, too, but are often unable to tell you how they feel. If a child receives any injury that could cause damage to their head, watch for behavior changes and problems with balance and coordination. Children with a concussion may:Seem dazed, overly tired, or listless. \n Be irritable, cranky, or very tearful. \n Lose interest in toys and normal activities. \n Appear off-balance or unsteady when walking or standing. \n Experience changes in sleep and eating habits. \n Before returning to play, recovered child athletes should complete a full-course of non-contact exercise, this should include challenges of gradually increasing intensity., For the first 24 hours after your injury it’s important to have someone stay with you to make sure your symptoms are not getting worse.Your caregiver should be someone who knew you before the injury so that they are familiar with your baseline personality and thinking patterns. If your symptoms worsen at all, your caregiver should take you to the hospital or call for emergency medical assistance. \n While you sleep during those first 24 hours, your caregiver should wake you up every 1-2 hours to check on your symptoms. You should be able to wake up normally. They can ask you what your name is, what state you live in, or what day of the week it is to ensure you aren’t getting confused. Neurological checks every 2 hours is important in the course of treatment and care. \n Despite popular belief, it’s okay to sleep when you have a concussion. You will likely require more sleep than usual as your brain recovers. Sleep is a great way to rest your brain right after your injury as well as throughout the next several weeks, so continue to nap throughout the day if you need to., If possible, take time off of work or school or find childcare so that you can rest for up to two weeks. Rest truly is the only medicine for a concussion, and the more you can rest after your injury the more quickly you will recover. Enlist family, friends or hired help to ease your burden for several weeks. \n You may be very sensitive to sounds and light after a concussion, and will likely be more comfortable keeping still than moving around. Your brain needs rest in order to heal, and this includes rest from stimulus. Lie in a quiet room with closed blinds or a towel over your eyes as much as you can. \n Do not try to read, text, or watch TV to pass the time. This stimulates your brain. True brain rest requires calm, quiet, stillness, and minimal brain activation. \n Avoid activities that raise your heart rate, like fast walking or lifting weights., No matter what you do, you may have post-concussion symptoms beginning a few days after your injury and lasting up to 2-3 weeks. Some people experience post-concussion symptoms for months. Symptoms may include dizziness, headaches, and difficulty concentrating.Some people also develop emotional symptoms like depression, which can last for several weeks to months. \n Once a concussion has been sustained, you cannot prevent further symptoms. Rest as much as you can. Be patient and know that this is a normal part of the process. \n Headaches may not develop until weeks or months after a head injury. \n This can be an uncomfortable and challenging time. In order to focus on your recovery, try to keep your stress to a minimum. Meditate daily and try mindfulness exercises. Do deep breathing techniques. Give yourself a hand massage. Do whatever calming, non-strenuous activities you enjoy. \n If you have a headache, it’s okay to take products like Tylenol that use the ingredient acetaminophen. This may alleviate some discomfort. However, do not take Advil, Motrin, or anything containing ibuprofen or aspirin – this could increase the risk of bleeding in your brain., If you have any remaining symptoms of concussion whatsoever, do not do anything that may cause further brain injury. Avoid riding a bike, playing sports, going on roller coasters – anything that may injure or jostle your brain. Second impact syndrome is caused when you get another concussion before the first heals, and it can cause fast and potentially fatal swelling of your brain.The term” second impact syndrome” is used when there is diffuse brain swelling after a second impact to the head. \n Your response time and ability to focus may be impaired after a concussion, which can make driving dangerous.Avoid driving until your symptoms improve. Speak with your doctor about your symptoms and whether it’s safe for you to drive, ride a bike, or use heavy equipment. \n After your initial time of complete rest, return to work, school, and other mental activities slowly. Start with half days, and speak with employers or teachers about having a lighter workload for several weeks as you ease back in to mental work. \n Your doctor will likely be willing to write a note for you requesting this if they think you need it. \n Do not restart any physical activities or even anything that raises your heart rate until you are free of concussion symptoms and have been checked by your doctor. Then return to playing your sport, riding your bike, or exercising slowly and gradually.It is not uncommon to feel symptoms return when you start to be physical. Let your body be your guide as you increase your activity level. If you start to feel sick, stop your activity for the day and rest. You will gradually build your stamina back up. \n Many sports teams have a post-concussion return-to-play protocol to ease you back in to your sport safely. If not, do not let anyone convince you to play before you’re well. Ask your doctor or a sports therapist for guidelines, and take responsibility for your health. \n According to the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine and the American Academy of Neurology, the concern for recurrent concussions has lead to serious consequences such as second impact syndrome and dementia, which has lead to the development of a series of guidelines that address concussion severity and return to play for athletes., It can be frustrating trying to return to your daily life while you are having difficulty concentrating, remembering and thinking. These problems will improve, but in the mean time help yourself by making lists of things you have to remember or writing notes as ideas occur to you. Focus on one task at a time.Consult with loved ones you trust before making any important decisions while your brain is recovering. \n Drinking alcohol or using any drugs that aren’t prescribed to you can delay your recovery. Do not drink alcohol until your doctor tells you that it is safe to do so., Having had a previous concussion is a risk-factor for getting another concussion, and unfortunately the effects of concussions are cumulative over your lifetime. This means that each subsequent concussion is easier to get, and has more severe symptoms than the last. Suffering from multiple concussions can even cause permanent problems after many years. If you’ve had a concussion, consider what activities are safe for you to do.You may need to refrain from contact sports like football, rugby, hockey, and roller derby, in which concussions are common. \n Some people find they can no longer go on roller coasters or handle the loud noise of concerts without feeling unwell. \n Always wear a helmet and protective gear when playing sports or riding a bicycle or motorcycle. Fasten your seatbelt any time you are in a vehicle. Check your home to ensure there is nothing you may trip over, like a loose rug., Some people experience symptoms of a concussion for much longer than others, even months or years. If you have to give up activities that you love, refrain from exercising like you once did, or struggle to be as mentally active as before your injury, you may feel discouraged, isolated or depressed. Find a local support group or join an online community to build solidarity with others who are experiencing similar struggles. \n If you feel deeply depressed, anxious, or have thoughts of self-harm, seek professional care. \n 
 The example uses the Console Application template.\n (ID int, Name varchar(50), Department varchar(50))")\n Other SQL commands may be issued in a similar manner, by passing the command string to ExecuteCommand. \n For instance, to get and display Ted Black's ID number, you could use this code: \n var queryResult = from e in db.Employees \n where e.Name == "Ted Black" \n select e\n var tedBlack = queryResult.First()\n Console.WriteLine(tedBlack.ID)\n This is the entire program shown above.

 So, for example, if you have a workbook with 2880 rows that creates 12 round spheres, 2880/12=240 x,y pairs you want, starting at the top probably. Otherwise, follow the steps below to create such a workbook and calculate the arc length of the sphere via the distance formula. You will need to create a new workbook and 4 worksheets: Data, Chart, Arc Length and Saves. \n \n In Edit, set all the first options to checked except Automatically Convert Date System . Set Display number of decimal places to blank (as integers are preferred). Preserve the display of dates and set 30 for 21st century cutoff. \n In View, click on show Formula Bar and Status Bar and hover for comments of all Objects . Check Show grid lines and set all boxes below that to auto or checked. \n In Chart, allow show chart names and set data markers on hover and leave the rest unchecked for now. \n In Calculation, make sure Automatically is checked and calculate before save is also checked. Set max change to .001 as goal-seeking is not done in this project. Check save external link values and use 1904 system \n In Error checking, check all the options. \n In Save, select save preview picture with new files and Save Autorecover after 5 minutes \n In Ribbon, keep all of them checked except Hide group titles and Developer . \n It helps by placing the cursor between the A of Column A and the 1 in Row 1 in the upper leftmost corner and selecting the entire worksheet.

Now you have the arc length cumulatively along the entire path. If you Edit Go To cell O125, you should see the cumulative total of the first sphere there, the one in the chart, at 7.3507 -- it would be nice to have a way to find these no matter how many integer spheres were input. \n Go to cell P6 and input "=IF(K6/Rows<>INT(K6/Rows),"",INT(K6/Rows))", which formula leaves a blank unless the row number is evenly divisible by the Rows/Spheres (120)=2880/24 calculated up top automatically. Format Fill P6 yellow and make the font bold red size 16. Edit Go To P6:P2885 and Edit Fill Down. Now we have each sphere# in bold red large font to make it easy to find the cumulative totals. \n Then copy a picture of the chart with some of the data of the Arc Length worksheet and with the shift key again depressed, Paste Picture underneath the two sets of data, the formulas and values you just pasted as a good record of how you created the image., THE INTeger function is a relic from the past and is not advertised any more but is valuable.,'CumTotal\n For more art charts and graphs, you might also want to click on Category:Microsoft Excel Imagery, Category:Mathematics, Category:Spreadsheets or Category:Graphics to view many Excel worksheets and charts where Trigonometry, Geometry and Calculus have been turned into Art, or simply click on the category as appears in the upper right white portion of this page, or at the bottom left of the page. \n 
 Eighties alternative rock bands like The Cure are good places to begin. Look at songs besides their singles, and get a feel for the music. When you're ready, move onto less mainstream Gothic bands.\n For the most part, the mainstream sounds that you will be used to are gone. The band Bauhaus is considered one of the most well-known and influential goth bands. Other good starting points can be found in punk and post-punk bands such as Joy Division, Siouxsie & the Banshees, The Damned, Sisters of Mercy or Christian Death. Later you may want to try more specific styles of Gothic music. \n Artists known to play in this style are Jill Tracy, Salon Betty, Rozz Williams, Katzenjammer Kabarett, Voltaire and Rasputina. \n A huge part of "Gothic" music is appreciation of very meaningful and deep lyrics. You can search online for the lyrics. Listen to what they are singing about. The lyrics vary from deeply touching and profound to perforated with a macabre whimsy. \n This is a cool type of music. It has it's own sound, like all genres. \n Websites such as and Gothic International, they're websites dedicated to informing others about the subculture, including its music. \n 
 Include both cardiovascular and strength exercises in your routine. Cardiovascular exercise gets your blood pumping and strength exercises can tone flabby skin associated with age. \n Improved circulation supplies more nutrients and oxygen to your skin. \n Exercise also increases your supply of collagen and fights against damaging free radicals in your body. \n Cardiovascular exercise can also lead to weight loss, and shedding a few extra pounds and some excess fat can drop your perceived age by several years.\n Stress can create more wrinkles and general wear on your skin. Relaxing more often may not undo the damage already done, but it can prevent your skin from aging any faster than necessary from this point on. \n A simple trick to try is to laugh more throughout the day. Laugh decreases stress hormones in the body and forces the muscles in your face to relax. If you don't feel like you have anything to laugh about look up jokes on the internet, or watch a funny movie or a comedian. \n On a similar note, you should also get six to eight hours of sleep each night. Dark, puffy eyes can make you look older, but getting enough sleep can clear those bags away. Keep in mind severe allergies can also cause dark circles, so get your allergies under control by avoiding the things that cause them, or by taking allergy medication (doctor approved, of course). Moreover, sleep reduces the body's production of stress hormone, which is good, because stress hormone can make your skin appear less elastic and less healthy. \n It's a simple trick, but straightening your posture gives the appearance of confidence, and confidence is a trait commonly associated with youth. Walking around with your back straight and your head high can shave a few years off your age in a matter of minutes. \n Use a gentle exfoliating wash on your skin one to three times each week. The process of exfoliation strips away dead skin cells and stimulates the production of new skin cells. As a result, your skin looks clearer, more elastic, and more youthful. \n Age causes skin to dry out, and dry, fine skin is more likely to develop wrinkles. Use a moisturizing cream on your face that is labeled as a face lotion, don't use hand lotion on your face. The reason for this is the hand lotions might be too strong and could cause you to break out. Yes, even we can break out at our age if we use the wrong products! Use hand lotion on your hands that has sunblock in it to help prevent age spots. One trick is to pat your face dry after a shower, and to put the lotion on your face immediately while your skin is still hydrated from the shower. The reason you pat your face is that the more rubbing and pulling you do to your face makes the wrinkles and bags under your eyes happen faster as your skin becomes more fragile and less elastic with age. \n Similarly, you should use a moisturizing lip balm to keep the skin on your lips healthy and plump, as well. They also sell lip plumping lipstick and lip gloss. \n UV rays from the sun can damage and age your skin even faster. Prevent this from happening by wearing sunscreen when you go outside. You should also consider wearing sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat to protect your skin even further. Sun damage can also cause freckles or skin cancer, so it's best to avoid the sun's rays anyway \n On a similar note, you should also avoid the use of tanning beds. The tanning process makes your skin look dry and wrinkled, which will make you look older. \n Smoking wrinkles the skin and turns both your nails and teeth yellow. Quitting the habit will not turn back the clock, but it can at least prevent the clock from speeding forward any faster than it naturally would. \n Your body builds up free radicals over time, and these free radicals can speed up the aging process. Antioxidants battle these free radicals, though, keeping them in check and even reversing some signs of aging in the process. \n Good sources of antioxidants include berries and other colorful fruit, nuts, dark chocolate, coffee, fruit juice, cooked vegetables, and beans. \n Excess sugar in the body can cause your body to undergo a process called glycation. This process can damage the collagen in your skin. When this happens, your skin becomes less elastic and wrinkles can form more easily. \n A glass of wine every few days should not do too much damage, but consuming alcohol in excess can cause multiple health problems. Taking care of your health is a good way to retain your youth. \n In addition to those foods already mentioned, stock up on foods that can provide you with vitamins and minerals your body needs to repair aged, damaged skin.Eat more zinc-rich oysters. Zinc repairs damaged skin. \n Olive oil and avocados contain good fats that can prevent further wrinkling. \n Water-based produce, like watermelon and cucumbers, keep the skin hydrated. \n Guava is packed with vitamin C and can help restore collagen levels. \n Sweet potatoes contain beta-carotene, which can fight against dry skin and improve your cell-turnover rate. \n Women should also eat more legumes, soy, red clover tea, and ground flaxseeds. All of these are good sources of phytoestrogens, which can fight against drooping skin. \n Eat less white rice and white bread, substitute brown rice and whole grain bread. \n For women, one of the more distressing signs of age is the "turkey neck"--saggy skin that hangs just below the face. Fashion scarves offer a quick, stylish way to cover up that patch of skin and shave off a few years from your face. \n Choose a lightweight scarf with a simple design and avoid scarves with unnecessary frills or embellishments. The idea is to cover your neck up without drawing attention to that area of your body. \n Avoid heavy scarves and turtlenecks since they often add too much unflattering bulk to the neck area. \n Gray hair gives away your age. Consult a professional hair stylist and discuss color treatments that can make your hair look more youthful without causing any more damage to it. \n Avoid home treatments since many of the chemicals found in commercial hair dyes can dry out and damage hair further. \n Typically, your best bet is to choose a shade similar to your natural hair color before gray hair started to appear. \n Talk to your hair stylist about options that may work for you. Keep in mind that as hair ages, it tends to weaken. As a result, longer hair often has less body and looks more unhealthy than shorter hair once you reach your 50s. \n If your hair is naturally curly, work with it rather than working against it. Curls can actually look fresher and younger at this age. Moreover, the treatments needed to straighten curly hair may only damage it further. \n Consider adding bangs. Bangs can mask skin imperfections that come with age. Choose long, wispy bangs or sideswept bangs over heavy, straight-cut styles. \n Try getting your hair blown out at a salon. This process can straighten wiry gray hairs while giving the rest of your hair more youthful body. \n Consider getting a softer hairstyle. Harsh hairstyles, such as ramrod straight hair, or an angular cut doesn't usually look good on older women, while a soft hairstyle, with gentle waves softens the face and is generally more attractive. Look at hair magazines for ideas. Can cut out the hairstyles you are interested in to bring into your stylist. Not all hairstyles will look good on you, so take the advice of a hairstylist you trust on what will and won't work. \n You might feel tempted to mask signs of aging by wearing more make-up, but in actuality, wearing fewer cosmetics will actually do more for your appearance. \n Opt for sheer lip glosses, lip pencils, and lip stains. Avoid lipsticks with heavy pigmentation. If you have wrinkles on your lips and your lipstick doesn't stay put you might need to use a lip pencil to outline your lips. If you do use a lip pencil be careful it matches your lipstick as close as you can, you don't want the lip pencil to be noticeable. \n Choose a blush that blends into your skin color and apply it higher on the cheekbone, away from the nose, to counteract the natural sagging of skin that comes with age. Use a powder blush, liquid blush is more difficult to apply evenly and doesn't look as natural. \n Avoid products with a shimmer, pearl or sparkle finish. \n Line the eye with eye shadow instead of traditional liner. If your eyelids droop over your eyes then the shadow might transfer, and might not work for you. In that case you might want to try a gel eyeliner that comes with a little brush. You line your eyes as close to the eyelashes as possible and with a thin line, not thick. I suggest charcoal or brown-black, straight black is just too dark. Your eye make-up needs to look softer and less severe overall. \n Older women usually have some hair that grows on your chin as you age. If it is too much trouble to do this on a regular basis you can get the chin hair professionally removed, but that costs more, and it doesn't always work and get all of it., If your eyelashes have thinned out with age, apply false lashes or lash extensions to make your eyes look younger. Natural styles tend to work better since glamorous ones are more likely to look fake. \n Younger people usually have darker eyebrows, and the color fades with age, so if your eyebrows disappear over time, or are faded then pencil them in with an eyebrow pencil with light feathery strokes following your natural eyebrows, you could also use shadow especially made for eyebrows that is sold in any grocery or other similar store, some eyebrow kits actually have eyebrow stencils, to help you with where the eyebrow shadow should go. Don't overdo it, practice, start light at first and darken up. It is much easier to darken your eyebrows than to overdo it and have to wash it off and start over again., Pluck out or wax away eyebrow hairs that have grown too long. You can also pluck out gray eyebrow hair or dye it a shade or two darker than your hair color. \n One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to pluck out all of your eyebrows and draw them in artificially with eyebrow pencil, or to get them tattooed on. This technique looks unnatural and will age you further, making you look older instead of younger. \n If you've begun balding, you might be tempted to hide your bald spot by combing your remaining hair over it or by wearing a toupee. Both options are not practical, however, since both are generally very noticeable. Moreover, in your desperation to hide your bald spot, you may actually make yourself look older to those looking at you. \n A better option is simply to get your hair cut short. Having short hair looks neater and may make your bald spot less noticeable. Moreover, since men of all ages can wear short buzz-cuts, the style itself does not reveal your age. \n If your facial hair is still growing even after the hair on top of your head has fallen out, you could try maintaining a neatly groomed mustache, beard, or combination style. \n While a lack of facial hair may have given you a "baby face" when you were younger, maintaining it as you get older can draw the eye away from the top of your head. \n Additionally, facial hair has a certain ruggedness associated with it. Your body might be wearing down with age, but facial hair can give the opposite impression and make you look as sturdy and strong as ever. \n Sometimes the beard gets gray before your hair does, if it bothers you too much you can buy over the counter dye kits made especially to dye beards and mustaches where they sell women's hair dye in grocery stores so you can dye it yourself. Just be sure to follow the directions. \n If you still have plenty of hair but see it turning gray or white, talk to your barber about getting the hair dyed. Aim for a shade close to the natural color you sported in your youth. If your hair has already been gray or white for a long time, you might want to consider going for a salt-and-pepper look, instead, since that could look more natural. \n Talk to a haircare professional before changing your hair color. Boxed dyes can contain chemicals that may weaken or damage your hair further. If you dye your hair yourself make sure you follow all of the directions for best results. \n The hair in your ears and nose generally grows faster and longer once you reach your 40s and 50s, so untrimmed hair in these areas is both untidy and a clear sign of age. Trim the hair whenever you can see it sticking out. \n On a similar note, if you have unruly white hair sticking out from beneath your collar, you should trim that every few days, as well. You could also have the neck hair permanently removed to lessen the hassle of shaving it yourself all the time. \n Retinoid creams help the body produce more collagen, and collagen renews your skin, making it look younger and healthier while minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and age spots. \n You can get over-the-counter retinoid creams, but prescription versions are more potent and may have a more dramatic effect. \n Attend to your fingernails. By this I mean look at them, are they normal or have they become yellow and thick? If they have yellowed that might mean you have a fungus, it is easily taken care of and your nails can look youthful again. Check with your doctor, he/she can prescribe an antifungal liquid for it. They also sell antifungal liquid at most grocery stores in the medicine department. \n They now have "invisible" braces to make it less noticeable that your teeth are getting aligned. Having beautiful teeth makes anyone more attractive, no matter your age., Yellowed teeth are another common sign of age. You can use a home whitening kit on your teeth for a quick fix, but for something that will last longer, see your dentist and ask to have a professional teeth whitening done. Keep in mind some foods discolor teeth, as does smoking. If you want your teeth to stay white avoid foods and drinks that are more likely to stain your teeth, such as coffee, for example. \n While acupuncture is technically a form of alternative medicine, you still need to go to a licensed professional to have the procedure done. It is a far more natural treatment than cosmetic injections, however, which reduces the risk of an adverse reaction. \n Acupuncture needles are inserted into the face, neck, and head. They stimulate skin cells and improve circulation, so your skin ends up producing more collagen and elastin. As a result, the skin in those areas becomes firmer and more youthful in appearance., Treatments that use laser waves and radio waves cause microscopic fissures to form in the skin, and these fissures stimulate collagen production. \n Radio wave treatments can be quite painful, but if you can endure them, you should notice considerably firmer, younger looking skin within six months. \n Hyaluronic acid fillers are injected into the skin, where they spread out and fill wrinkles and similar age lines. As a result, even the smallest lines of your face can look smoother within a short period of time.There are different filler treatments available, so talk to your doctor about which one might be best for you. Surface fillers work great on small lines and cause very little bruising, but deeper fillers might be necessary for deeper wrinkles. \n This specialized procedure is used to lessen or eliminate spider veins. Since spider veins are associated with age, removing them can make you look younger. \n The procedure used to be very painful, but newer techniques have made the procedure quicker and less uncomfortable. \n During this procedure, pulsed light is combined with a specialized topical drug to destroy abnormally pigmented skin cells. Within two or three sessions, sun-aged skin can look closer to its natural age. \n Note that this treatment also has a practical purpose since it can be used to target precancerous cells, as well. \n During this procedure, acid is used to burn away the top layers of skin. This removes damaged skin and stimulates new skin growth, which can lead to a smoother, younger looking face. \n Trichloroacetic acid peels are among the most common chemical peels. \n Some treatments can cause scabbing and may take several weeks to heal, but there are a few newer treatments that can result in less immediate pain and discomfort. \n 
, Signs and symptoms to be aware of in babies include: \n Fever \n Unusual sleepiness and/or irritability (such as constant crying) \n Swelling in the fontanel (the soft spot on the top of your baby's head) \n Poor feeding \n Neck stiffness \n This is because the faster that medical treatment can be received, the better, both in terms of preventing spread and reducing your risk of dying from it. It is important to seek immediate medical care if you or someone else exhibits any of the following: \n Neck stiffness in addition to flu-like symptoms. Neck stiffness is one of the cardinal signs that often differentiates meningitis from a general flu-like illness; if you or someone else presents with this symptom, it is important to see a doctor immediately. \n Flu-like symptoms that seem more severe than normal. \n It is important to understand that bacterial meningitis can be very serious and even fatal if not treated immediately. \n If in doubt, seek a professional medical opinion sooner rather than later. \n This is especially important if the affected person was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis. \n Your blood will be examined for an elevated white blood cell count (a common sign of an infection), and your blood will also be cultured in a specialized dish to see what microorganisms (such as bacteria) grow. \n If microorganisms such as bacteria are found in your blood (in what is called the "blood culture"), your doctor can confirm the presence of an infection and can know which bug is responsible for it. \n Your doctor can also test the bug that has grown in the dish for its "antibiotic susceptibility." What this means is that he can see which antibiotics are or are not effective at killing the specific microorganism that has infected your body. \n You will most likely receive this through the Emergency Room, to ensure that you get it quickly. \n The purpose of the CT scan is to evaluate for any unusual swelling in your head area, and to check that it is safe for your doctors to proceed with what is called a "lumbar puncture" (the one test that can confirm for sure whether or not you have meningitis).If there is excessive swelling or inflammation, it may be too dangerous to perform a lumbar puncture (a spinal cord tap) due to the risk of what is called "brain herniation." This is when brain tissue gets compressed, which can lead to death. \n After a CT scan has been performed to ensure that it is safe, your doctor will insert a needle into your spinal canal to get a sample of "CSF" (cerebrospinal fluid). Your CSF will then be tested for the presence of bacteria and other microorganisms, among other things. \n If you have meningitis, your lumbar puncture will most likely show the results of low glucose (sugar), elevated white blood cells (immune cells), and increased protein. \n Your doctor can also culture your CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) to see if any bacteria or microorganisms grow. \n If so, your doctor can perform "susceptibility testing" to determine which antibiotics (or other antimicrobial agents) the bugs that are present are susceptible to (i.e., to determine the most effective choice of treatment for you moving forward). \n This is because bacterial meningitis can be very dangerous and even fatal if not treated promptly. Therefore, doctors are trained to err on the side of caution and to give you the antibiotics until further test results become available. \n If a bacterial meningitis is confirmed, your doctor will likely choose a more specific antibiotic for you moving forwards. \n The choice of antibiotic will depend upon the results of the "susceptibility testing;" in other words, on which antibiotic was shown to have superior efficacy at treating the specific strain of bacterial meningitis that you have. \n These are immune suppressing agents that can reduce potentially dangerous inflammation in the brain area and meninges (the specific area that meningitis affects). \n Note that, in more severe cases, anti-convulsant (anti-seizure) medications may also be needed. \n This is because the infection and subsequent inflammation surrounding the brain area can lead to seizures in some of the more severe cases. \n Elements of supportive care that will be offered and/or recommended by your physician include: \n Stopping all daily activities such as work and other things, and resting in bed until you show enough positive signs of recovery. \n Drinking plenty of fluids to keep your hydration levels in a safe and appropriate range. IV fluids may be given in a hospital setting if oral fluids alone are insufficient. \n Receiving pain medications to reduce your fever and body aches as needed. \n \n If it is determined that you have viral meningitis, the mainstays of treatment are supportive care, as well as plenty of rest and ongoing medical supervision and check-ups until you recover. \n If you have viral meningitis caused by HSV (the herpes simplex virus), you may receive antiviral treatment. However, all other causes of viral meningitis do not currently have treatment available. \n 
 Talk to your defense attorney who represented you in your trial to be sure you know what dates you will be in jail. You also need to know what charge you are being held for. Whether you are being held pending bail or trial or to serve a sentence after conviction is also pertinent.\n Obviously you will need to tell your boss if you will be missing work or if you are required by company rules or a contract. If you are able to structure your jail time so that you do not miss work, you may not be required to tell your employer. Even if you aren’t required to disclose your sentence, you may want to if your boss is likely to find out about it through other channels, though., Some companies offer a leave of absence without pay for up to three months at the discretion of the employer. If you are a valued employee, your offense does not otherwise impact your job, and your jail term is not long, your boss may consider allowing you a leave of absence for the period of your incarceration. , If you have accrued vacation days, you may be able to use them to offset some of the time you will be incarcerated. \n This could be early or late in the day, but generally is not in the middle of the work day. Ask for a meeting to discuss an important personal issue that will impact your work. , Frequently, having a third person there may help you remember things and keep the meeting from getting overly emotional. , When you meet with your boss, don’t beat around the bush. Let them know what is going on and how it will (or won’t) impact your job.Tell your boss you are sorry, but that you will be going to jail. \n Tell your boss the reason you will be going to jail if you hope to keep your job. Keep in mind that criminal records are public, and your boss will be able to find out the reason through other channels. \n Tell your boss the dates you will be in jail. \n Ask your boss if you can take a leave of absence, extended vacation, or preserve your job in some other way. If no, ask if you will be allowed to reapply for your job or a similar job once you are released. \n It is best to do this in person. Some situations make that impossible, however, such as: \n Your boss in not in the same location as you. \n Your boss is on vacation. \n You are incarcerated without prior notice. \n Do not use slang or abbreviations. If a letter, include a return address and formal address block. \n In the body of your written communication, don’t beat around the bush. Let them know what is going on and how it will (or won’t) impact your job. Your first paragraph should:Tell your boss you are sorry, but that you will be going to jail. \n Tell your boss the reason you will be going to jail if you hope to keep your job. Keep in mind that criminal records are public, and your boss will be able to find out the reason through other channels. \n Tell your boss the dates you will be in jail. \n In the second paragraph, tell your boss you would like to take a leave of absence, extended vacation, or preserve your job in some other way. Let them know that you understand if that cannot be arranged, but let them know you would like to reapply for your job or a similar job once you are released if necessary. \n If time is of the essence and you will be missing work, you will not want to wait for a regular mail service to get the letter to your boss. \n It is best to do this in person. Some situations make that impossible, however, such as: \n Your boss in not in the same location as you. \n Your boss is on vacation. \n You are incarcerated without prior notice. \n The person who communicates for you should be someone you trust and who you believe will present the information in a professional manner. This could be: \n Your attorney \n Your spouse \n A trusted co-worker \n A trusted friend or relative \n Be sure this person knows all of the information necessary and how to properly inform your boss. They will need to tell your boss what is going on and how it will (or won’t) impact your job. They should:Tell your boss you are sorry, but that you will be or are going to jail. \n Tell your boss the reason you will be going to jail if you hope to keep your job. Keep in mind that criminal records are public, and your boss will be able to find out the reason through other channels. \n Tell your boss the dates you will be in jail. \n Your messenger should tell your boss you would like to take a leave of absence, extended vacation, or preserve your job in some other way. Let them know that you understand if that cannot be arranged, but let them know you would like to reapply for your job or a similar job once you are released if necessary. \n In most cases, an employer can fire you for missing work because of incarceration. In fact, in most cases, you can be fired from your job for any reason so long as it is not a prohibited reason, such as discrimination. , Many jails have education and job training programs to help you gain employment once you are released., They may be able to help you apply for your old job or one similar to it.
 Be careful not to disturb or damage them while working around them. \n Barely loosen (break loose) each of the 11 bolts (10mm) connecting the OHC (overhead cam) valve cover to the engine. Loosen the 9 bolts around the edge of the cover that connect it to the block (one in on the very end). Two of those 10mm bolts are upon the cover with one about 3 times longer and (it was covered up by that power steering hose) and the one in the center is about 4 times longer than the ones around the edges. Once all are just loosened then finish removing them., The engine should be easy to turn with a socket wrench on the crankshaft bolt since the spark plugs are out and all pressure is released., aligned with the top of the engine head while at the same time you line up the timing mark on the crankshaft harmonic pulley pointing straight up at the same time as the cams are aligned (or use the crankshaft key and slot later in the process when the harmonic pulley is off). \n Caution: the TDC (top dead center) could be 180 degrees off of the correct TDC even when the crankshaft mark or crankshaft key is correctly pointing straight up ("It would then be at the top of the exhaust stroke."); so then align it as explained next. \n Caution: check timing is at the correct TDC (top dead center of the compression stroke) and find the marks are on the back of the sprockets and align them with the edge of the engine head. The older models have a distributor and you can remove the distributor cap to see if it is pointing at spark plug cable terminal number one (for cylinder number 1) when the mark on crankshaft pulley shows it is at TDC. If it points to the opposite side of the distributor then turn the engine slowly 360 degrees on the crankshaft to be back around to TDC ("top of the compression stroke"). Newer engines do not have a distributor and so the correct TDC can be found while the harmonic pulley timing mark is approaching TDC. This is done using the compression stroke air pressure measured in the "number one spark plug hole" by a "compression gauge" to know when the piston is on the compression stroke and then turning slowly and carefully to exactly the TDC as shown by the crankshaft and the cam sprockets timing marks. Compression pressure means that the piston in cylinder one was on the compression stroke not the exhaust stroke which also comes to TDC. \n Required: securely place a "plastic/rubber" stop-block (you may use a bottle stopper from a wine bottle preferably "not real cork" which might crumble) to put it in place to jam the cam sprockets with the "rubber stop-block." Use the stop-block before releasing the tensioner pulley to remove the timing belt, or else when the timing belt is removed the cams will "turn" (in opposite directions) about two notches--pushed by the valve springs pressure off TDC of the cam lobes. Later before the timing belt is re-installed use two "open-end" wrenches or adjustable spanners for 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) on the hex part of the camshaft (not on the sprocket bolt) to slightly nudge the sprockets back and forth (small wiggling) to get the stop block to hold both cam marks correctly aligned while the stop-block is between the two cam sprockets. So it holds both cams at the same time in TDC position (You may purchase a special stop-block made for this purpose if you prefer.). \n Put on the parking brake., Then use a jack-stand to support the car. Do not depend on the jack to support it. You will be removing the wheel adjacent to (next to) the pulleys only., Watch your head., It should work under the air conditioner bracket which is massive on the older models. The engine being supported is because you will remove (not yet) the motor mount in steps when you get to it in a later step; that mount is between the top and lower halves of the timing-cover and is very much in the way of working on the accessory belts, timing belt and water pump., The two toward the firewall of the auto are difficult to reach and even to see. Use a short, small ratchet drive extension., You probably can wiggle and jiggle the pulley while start gently prying and pulling it off the crankshaft. If not, then you may need to use a steering wheel puller or similar puller., This was necessary to be able to remove the lower timing cover., One screw is hard to see in the middle of the cover, right below the motor mount.,
 Be sure to create an account and pay any required fees.\n After you have read all of the test-taking strategies provided in the booklet, take the sample test. This will give you an idea of how far you are from your goal score and the areas which require further attention. \n Write down the areas you need to work on before the exam and decide how many hours you will need to adequately prepare for each section. Once this has been accomplished, look at how much time you have until the exam, and divide your time accordingly. \n The longer you have to study, the more thorough your preparation can be. \n Familiarity with the layout, structure, and content of the exam can improve your performance and help you stay relaxed on test day. It will also help you see if there are any areas you need to revisit before taking the test. \n Make sure to review all of your study materials as often as possible in the days leading up to the test. \n You will be required to present identification and your admissions ticket before you can take the exam. You may also want to bring several sharpened number 2 pencils and a sweater or jacket in case the room is cold. \n You will be tested for several hours, and proper rest and nutrition can help you maintain your focus and concentration. \n 
 Idle efficiency in Windows 7 is improved by reducing resource utilization and enabling hardware to go into lower power states during long periods of battery inactivity. This includes the processor, disk, memory, and network activity on the computer. To demonstrate just how much power can be saved, CPUs consume nearly 0 watts when idle, but up to 35 watts at full power.\n In Windows 7, certain services are only started when triggered by an event such as device insertion or an IP change. This makes it unnecessary to have services starting all the time and reduces the amount of background processes, then reducing your Dell D5318 battery. \n PPM allows Windows 7 to choose the appropriate processor performance state depending on the load and scale performance accordingly. \n Often times however, there are shorter periods of inactivity in between. To save additional power, ADB defines will allow dimming the display. ADB can also utilize hardware sensor technology to adjust display brightness accordingly to ambient light. \n This is the lowest unresponsive power state that a codec can go into. It can also further conserve power when an audio device is not in use. Windows 7 also supports selective suspend technology that extends to USB audio-class devices such as microphones and web-cams. \n Timer Coalescing increases the average idle period by letting the Windows kernel combine periodic software activity. \n 
 1) The bully who taunts and hurts others openly, and 2) The bully who enlists adults to bully others on their behalf. Learning to recognize these two types of bullies will help you avoid suffering at their hands.\n This kind of bully often taunts others loudly and pushes/shoves/kicks in order to get and keep your attention. The danger of this type of bully is fairly obvious. Being taunted with insults can cause temporarily hurt feelings, but the addition of aggressive physical contact takes this type of bully into the dangerous category. These bullies are attracted to those who are popular around them (not often weak or diminutive) and they tend to pursue them openly, despite the presence of adults or physically stronger children. They are difficult to manage and are often a regular presence in detention rooms around the school for their uncontrollable behaviour. \n Make eye-contact brief but meaningful as you pass by them, and greet them as if you are giving a friend a "shout-out" (keeping your voice up and cheerful sounding). \n Wave at them with your arm held high in the air if they shout out to you, and laugh and shake your head as you walk away. \n Treat shoving/kicking/pushing as aggression initiated and stay solid on your feet as you shove them back. Sending a taunting and touching bully reeling into a crowd creates plenty of disruption for you to make an artful escape, and will give you the extra moment lead you'll want to let an adult know about the altercation. \n Give them the impression that you have a mean streak that has yet to be seen, but that you're willing to offer him a personal demonstration if he continues to show interest. \n Once the bully is subdued, quietly tell him/her you'll remember them, smile, and walk away. Repeat this as often as necessary. \n This kind of bully taunts others quietly and seeks out adults to enlist their support in bullying you. They are typically unpopular, are physically weaker than their peers, and tend to be known as tattle-tales by other classmates. These quiet bullies lie to unsuspecting adults (as well as physically stronger peers) and manipulate their sympathies to exact revenge against those classmates who dare to not like them. They have a distorted sense of self worth that makes them feel entitled to the respect and friendship of everyone with whom they come into contact. \n The danger in dealing with this type of bully is harder to quantify. These bullies are not concerned with hurting others physically or mentally, directly (they are aware that their lack of strength, stature, and sharp wit put them at an extreme disadvantage when trying to intimidate their peers). Their goal is to use others to carry out their intimidation and bullying. \n When crossed, because they tend to enlist the support of powerful adults, the quiet bully can indirectly cause others physical harm (corporal punishment administered by school authorities and/or parents) as well as harm to their enemies' future (via notations added to school files, falsely labelling a student as a "bully", which may be used to evaluate their college/employment applications later in life.). \n After you've done that, go to the school counsellor and explain what is happening to you, and express your fear that this little bully will convince the teacher that you are doing things you haven't done. \n Should you wind up in trouble, you'll need your parents to argue any addition to your school records made by these teachers under the direction of the bully. \n 
 For best results, it's ideal to start at least two weeks before the concert you want to attend is scheduled, and the longer in advance you prepare, the better.\n Write down (or print out) where the concert is taking place, how much it costs to go, when it is happening, and who is performing. \n The more they know about it, the more comfortable they will feel about you being there. \n However, discuss the concert with your folks before you buy the ticket, because if they say no after you've bought one, then you might be stuck with an expensive ticket you can't even use! \n Get clear written directions if you have never been there before. The important thing is who will be driving you there and back. Your parents will feel better letting you go if the driver is a reliable, respectable person. As a rule of thumb, the older the driver is, the happier your parents will be. \n (Make sure the driver knows this too!) It may seem dorky, but consider asking your parents to drive you. Riding a bus or other public transportation would work well too. \n Try to make sure your friends don't look too scary when they first meet your parents, and get them to act polite. \n You're safer together than you would be alone. \n Your parents may want you to "earn" the trip to the concert. So if you don't get along well with your parents, make sure your behavior is very good for at least a week before you mention the concert. Be considerate. Do chores without being asked more than once, say "please" and "thank you," smile, and tell them a little about how your day at school was. \n The concert is your time to have fun, but consider choosing an outfit that is reasonably modest and low-key. Your parents don't want you to attract "the wrong kind of attention." Remember, the music will be just as good no matter what you're wearing. \n Mosh pits are actually somewhat dangerous, and your parents may not want you near one. Tell your parents you won't go in the mosh pit, and they will be more likely to say yes to the concert. (But don't say it unless you mean it.) \n Play one or two of their more positive songs, tell your parents about the band's great charity work in Africa, and so on. Be truthful, but show the band in the best possible light. Explain why seeing them live is so important to you. \n Again, your parents like to know where you are and what you're up to, and knowing you'll be home at a certain time gives them assurance. \n You won't be able to hear it ring during the show, but you will be able to keep in touch with your family if there is a problem. Call your parents after the concert, when you're leaving to come home.It would be better to text during the concert. \n 
 This image demonstrates a dress with flair. \n You could also wear cute flats. \n Ashley also has Chanel sunglasses and Louis Vuitton purses, luggage, and dog bags. You don't have to buy designer though, go to a store like Claire's Accessories and buy lookalikes for a fraction of the price. \n Ashley sometimes has causal days where she just wears sweats with her Ugg boots. To achieve this look, wear a pair of sweats, Ugg boots or comfy shoes, and a pair of sunglasses. \n Wear a light red tinted lipgloss, a lot of mascara, and a little bit of highlighter or bronzer. You could also wear eyeliner, and some eyeshadow in a mixed colours any dark colour would work! colors like,pale black,gray or peach. You'll look like Ashley in no time. \n She owns her look and doesn't let anyone stand in her way of getting to it. She knows how to dress to make her proportions look normal and attractive. \n or a volume shampoo if you have thin hair.Then condition.\n Then separate your hair into 5 sections, letting one down and pinning up the other 4 with clips. Then use the mousse/gel to scrunch hair, being sure to disperse the products well. Then scrunch up your hair again and pin in up. Repeat with the other 4 sections. \n
 Select a chair that can be painted with latex or oil-based paint. Wood chairs are the easiest to paint. \n \n Latex paints offer quick and easy cleanup, but take longer to dry than oil-base. \n Oil-based paints are more resistant to chipping and scratching. Oil-based paints have a strong smell, sometimes lingering for days. When using oil-based paint, keep area well ventilated. \n The type of brushes needed will be determined by the type of paint you choose. \n Brushes made of polyester filaments can be used for any type of paint as they do not absorb water like natural or nylon bristles. Natural bristles work best with oil-based paints. \n Primer is used for metal rather than wood chairs. \n Sanding with 100 grit sandpaper should always be done prior to painting. Sand until surface is smooth. Wipe the chair with a damp cloth to remove sanding residue. \n Stir with paint stick. Pour small amounts of paint into separate pan or container for easier portability while painting. \n Allow sufficient time to dry. Most chairs will require a second coat to cover any missed spots. \n Apply each coat thinly for a more even finish and to prevent drips caused by too much paint. Use a third or fourth coat if necessary. \n Use paint thinner in ventilated area. \n\n Wipe out the oil grease from your chair and then leave it to dry. \n Primer paint is the base coating for your paint color of your chair. It adds durability to the paint. Leave it to dry. \n Apply 2 or 3 coatings, and then leave it to dry. \n 
 A pair of forks works well. Beat the eggs. \n Refrigerate this filling mixture for about 30 minutes. The refrigeration step is optional, but it gives you time to prepare everything else. \n You can clarify the butter by skimming off the white solids. \n Keep the butter warm in a small crock pot, over a very low flame, or by storing it in a heavy, ceramic pot. You can microwave it for a few seconds now and then to reheat. \n Measure the filo on the short side and decide if you will cut it into two, three, or four strips. It's better to have strips that are too wide than too narrow. \n You can cut a stack of several sheets at once. \n Folding the dough back along itself as you go can help to keep the cuts straight and parallel to the edge. \n Roll extra sheets tightly in waxed paper and store them in the refrigerator until you are ready to work with them. Filo that dries out tears much more easily. \n The butter makes the filo bake to a flaky crisp. (In the photo, instead of waxed paper, there's a blue silicone baking sheet, for contrast.) \n You can eyeball the quantity according to the size of the strip. \n If there is a bit of extra, tuck it in or simply fold it around and stick it to the outside. \n This is the same fold used for the United States flag, after it has been folded in half twice. \n If you are making the tiropita before an event, you can stack them between sheets of waxed paper and freeze them until you are ready. \n Frozen tiropita will take a little longer to bake than thawed ones. Serve hot. \n 
 Think about how you can translate information about your friend into a physical gift or experience.\n Using the mental list of information that you noted, think of gifts that speak to who they are as a person. Buy your music-obsessed friend an album or a t-shirt from their favorite band’s merchandise. Look into fan-club memberships as well. \n Get art or craft supplies for an artistic person. Think about art projects they’d like to accomplish, or about work that they haven’t finished. \n Look for rare or quirky team memorabilia for a sporty friend. Check out EBay for autographed cards, bobbleheads, stickers or other sports items that others are unlikely to have. \n Buy toys for the person’s pets. Pets are important to their owners, and sometimes a gift for a pet can mean as much as a gift for their owner! \n Continue to think outside the box. Remember that no matter what your friend’s interests are, your gift should be thoughtful and interesting. \n If you're giving a gift to a close friend, a good gift will be one that you and a friend can both relate to, and one with a great deal of meaning. Think of a gift that symbolizes your relationship, and remember, thoughtfulness and effort can mean more than money. Make a gift that may reference things that you have done together. \n Make a scrapbook with all your photos. This can be a great gift, as your friend will appreciate the time you put into it, and it will bring back memories. \n Make something simple like a friendship bracelet or necklace to remind your friend of how much you care. \n Sometimes, a meaningful message or letter can be more thoughtful than a physical object. Pair your letter with a gift and you'll definitely make an impression. Don’t make it too long-winded though! \n Simply spending time with someone can show them that you care, and experiences can be even more fun than a physical item that they might not get much use out of. Take a friend out for dinner, drinks, a concert or a movie. As with physical gifts, think about your friends personality and interests and choose a gift accordingly. \n Buy your friend a membership to a local museum, aquarium or zoo. They will get free entry for a year as well as special perks for joining. \n Go a little crazy! Sometimes, gifts that seem impossible are more reasonably priced than you might imagine. Look into a horseback riding session if your friend loves animals, or skydiving if your friend is a daredevil. Rent a car and check out a state park with an adventurous friend. \n If they're going through rough times financially, sometimes an eased burden is just as meaningful to a friend as a nice gift. \n Make the donation in their name, and they'll get some gifts and perks in recognition of the contribution. \n Sometimes, in gift giving, we go overboard thinking about how to give the absolute perfect gift. However, it’s more important to think about how the gift will affect your friend, and whether or not it is something truly useful and meaningful to them. , But do not reveal that you are going to give or what is in it., Mentally note: \n The person's gender \n Their age \n Whether they live at alone or with family \n Whether they’re in school or have graduated \n Think about things that they like or talk about, whether it’s music, movies, art or sports. Think about any skills, talents or hobbies they may have. Try to remember anything they've mentioned wanting in the past weeks, or anything they've had their eye on. \n They may have posted things that they’ve got their eye on or gadgets that they think are cool. Social media profiles can also give a better picture of their interests. \n They may have a wishlist on a shopping site, which will make gifting easier. You can comb through their registry and find something they’ve already selected for themselves. If they do shop online, ask if you can look over their shoulder and see what they’re shopping for. \n If they’re considering buying an item but decide against it, make a mental note of it as a potential present. \n You may overhear them talking about items they'd like to have while they're around friends or coworkers. \n They may have some ideas, and be willing to help. Ask if they’ve ever given the person a gift in the past, how they reacted to it. This may give you a good idea of what to give them (and what hasn’t gone over well). \n They probably know them very well, and can give some advice. They’ll have more intuition about things that the person has been wanting lately. \n Take stock of how many years you’ve known them, how big a part of your life they are, and how important they are to your future. \n Best friends are deserving of very meaningful, personal gifts that reflect your years of friendship. \n Don’t give people you have just met or don’t know too well overly personal or expensive gifts. Expensive gifts may give them the idea that you’re just trying to impress them, while overly personal gifts might come off as too forward. \n Christmas and birthdays are big, important holidays for which larger gift giving is acceptable. However, there are many holidays like Easter, Wedding Anniversaries, and Valentine’s Day that require different levels and types of gift giving. \n Let your friend know how much you truly care with an extra thoughtful gift, or by throwing them a surprise party. \n Make sure that your gifts fit tradition when attending a bridal or baby shower. A mom-to-be probably won’t appreciate a cast iron skillet any more than a bride-to-be might appreciate a box of diapers!, Gift covers are very effective. You can use a gift cover of hearts if you are gifting him/her for there marriage. You can use gift cover of a baby if you are gifting on her becoming mother. If it is her/him on there birthday you can use a gift wrap of balloons design or bell designed gift wrap. Or if it is your personal occasion you can also create a gift wrap with yours and his/her's images. Just you and him/her. \n 
, Older single pane windows transmit (lose) heat more quickly than newer double or triple glazed windows which are far better at isolating different air temperatures on either side., A space below an attic with insulated floors or located above a basement are considered insulated., Most spaces require 10 watts per square foot of space for homes built since the 1970s. A 12 foot (3.7 m) by 12 foot (3.7 m) room has 144 sq/ft. Assuming a ceiling height less than 8 feet (2.4 m), this room should be heated comfortably with 1500 watts of heat. 1500 watts of heat is a total of 6 feet (1.8 m) of heat, assuming "standard density" baseboard heaters are selected for installation. Standard density heat is rated at 250 watts per foot. There is one other type of heat called "high density" (HD). HD heat has more than the 250 watts per foot that the standard density heat has, but does not heat quicker nor is operated for any less. HD merely provides more heat with a smaller footprint., All of the considerations above (windows type and number, insulation, etc.) will come into play when purchasing heaters. The baseline wattage should be increased by up to 100% if the room suffers from all of the considerations. It is important to note that adding additional heaters will not increase the cost of operation. Additional heaters allow the room to maintain desired temperature during the colder days, as opposed to having the minimum heat (or baseline) installed. If only the baseline calculated amount of heat were installed, it would not be able to replace the heat as quickly as it was lost due to lack of insulation, single pane windows, etc. A room that ideally requires 1500 watts of heat might need as much as 3000 watts if it suffers from all the issues listed above. This applies to ALL types of heat (and cooling in the summer for that matter), regardless of fuel type or technology. Insulation is inexpensive over the long run., The heat can be installed one of two ways. In the example room, install (1) 1500 watt heater or install 2 or more heaters totaling 1500 watts. The latter method can be employed for rooms at the corners of a building - having 2 exterior walls. Typically, heaters are installed below windows, where most of the heat loss occurs. Adding more watts of heat will allow the room to reach the desired temperature faster than if no additional watts of heat were installed., Installing 240 volt heaters is best as wire sizes and number of circuits are significantly reduced. The National Electrical Code allows a 15 amp circuit to carry up to 12 amps, and a 20 amp circuit may carry up to 16 amps. The total watts allowed to be connected can be determined simply by multiplying volts by amps only because this is a purely resistive AC circuit (AC wattage calculations are much more complex for inductive and capacitive reactant circuits that exist in appliances and electronics). The 15 amp circuit is 240 x 12 = 2880 watts. The 20 amp circuit is 240 x 16 = 3840 watts. This is a maximum of 14 and 19 feet of 240 volt, standard density heat, respectively., The thermostat should be located on an interior wall. It should never be located above a heater or other heat source, or in a dead air space such as behind a door., Cut the wall open with knife or hand saw., This may require fishing or snaking of the cable between the points, and will probably be most time consuming. For this reason, many times a single heater sized to heat the entire space is often selected so that fishing or snaking is minimized. Indicate this cable as the "LINE" so it can be determined as such after it has been installed in the box for the thermostat., Examine the heater(s) and remove BOTH front covers from both ends of each heater. Place the heater(s) against the wall at the desired location., Because they are provided, no box(es) need be installed in the wall. Simply create a small hole in the wall for the cable from which to emerge and pass through appropriate connectors at the back of one of the compartments to allow the cables to enter. Connections are to be made in the compartments. This is detailed below., Indicate this cable as the "LOAD" so it can be determined as such after it has been installed in the box for the thermostat., Continue to daisy-chain between successive heaters as needed., Push the cable into the connector until 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of the jacket is inside the wiring compartment., Connect ALL the bare and any green wires together with a wirenut. Install a short piece (8") of bare wire between the bare and green wires to the green screw on the thermostat if it is not already connected., Carefully inspect the thermostat for "LINE" and/or "LOAD" markings., Each of the black and white wires from the panel must connect to one LINE wire or terminal. Under no circumstances should the black and white wire from the panel be connected together., Connect it in the same manner as the LINE side.,
 \n Label and number each wire with tape and its matching hole with the same number, then you could remove all of the spark plugs at once. Don't remove the wire from the distributor unless you accurately number each outlet to match the plug and its cable.\n \n 90% strength alcohol, brake or carburetor/injector cleaner or mineral spirits are good choices that all work well when cleaning spark plugs. \n Rinse well, brush, dig out any goop with a thin wire. Use the alcohol, brake or carburetor/injector cleaner or mineral spirits to quickly displace water to dry them. Dry well. \n Buy HCl available in a quite stronger liquid solution called Muriatic Acid, or Hydrochloric Acid (exact same stuff), at a hardware store, home building supply/lumberyard).Caution: Only dilute any strong acid by pouring it into water (the opposite can cause popping/splattering) of drops of strong solution. \n \n Canned pressurized air will work well to remove tiny bits of debris if you don't have an air compressor. \n \n This is an important step to take even when cleaning spark plugs that appear to be clean. \n \n This extra blast of air simply eliminates any debris left on the spark plugs. \n \n Gap the clean spark plugs to your automobile's specifications using a spark plug gap tool. \n \n If the holes are extremely dirty, you can use the same solution to clean them that you used for your spark plugs. \n Double-check that each wire/cable is replaced onto the correct spark plug as your go. \n Start your vehicle to see how well it runs now that the spark plugs are clean. \n 
 This will be the chin of your tiger, so you can draw it the right size for you. If you want a big tiger, draw a wider U and for a small one, a small U, just don't make it a thin U, as this will look too long. \n Make sure the ears are the same size on both sides, and are at the same level for a symmetrical, more professional look., Draw a line from the bottom of one ear to the bottom of the other. This should complete the outline of the head, so that it looks like a proper tiger., This will be your tiger's nose. Don't make it too thin or too wide, draw it to fit on your tiger's face correctly., This is is the tiger's mouth, and is also a simple way to draw a lion or kitten's mouth., Just to the left of it, draw a line that curves down into the line on the side of the nose. Do the same on the right, curving the line down and into the side line of the nose., You have two options for coloring them. You could just colour them black for a simple look, but for a shiny look, draw a tiny circle in the corner of the eye, then color all of the eye black, apart from that tiny white circle., Repeat on the right, and be sure that the muzzle is the right size to fit the face, just like with the nose., Add a line on the right too, and draw them to be the same length, as a lopsided tiger won't look as good as a symmetrical tiger., Leave a gap in the middle which will soon become legs. The lines you draw across should be the thickness of the leg - if you want skinny legs, leave a large gap in the middle of the lines, and for fat legs, a smaller gap., You should leave a gap between the head and the end of the line. Do this in both sides., The line you draw should be straight with no bumps., Connect back into the body, and don't do the same on the left. This should only be done on the right to add a 3D effect., Draw stripes on it, and color the one closest to the tip of his tail black. Also add little black triangles coming out of the sides of his face, three on each side for stripes. Do this to the sides of the body too., Done! You have a tiger!
 (Some examples are Lynx Town, Cloud City, etc.)\n Call it 'City Hall,' 'Town Meeting Hall,' 'White House,' etc. \n Inside that, create a 'Main Office.' \n They represent the items important to the town and various tasks that are fulfilled in the center building of the town, such as 'Record Book' or 'Secretary's Office.' \n This is your house. If you wish, you could be the mayor, or just a regular citizen. \n He/she doesn't need to have your name, but if not, make sure you remember which person you are. Two ways to create people are: \n Make a folder with their name so that you can show what they are "holding," much like an inventory. You can also change the icon of the folder with downloaded sprites or pictures of people so that they can have identities. If you need to turn pictures into icons, you can download a icon-making program. \n Make a Word document or textbook file and keep track of what they own, their jobs, relationships, what they think, etc. on it. \n If your people are represented by folders, use a Word or textbook document and create a starting amount of money somewhere around $100,000 for each person. \n If you have Word or textbook documents for your people, just type a bold heading 'Checkbook' or 'Money' and keep track under that. \n Everything you build will subtract from that person's amount so give everything a price and TAKE NOTES. \n To do this, make a Word or textbook document outside the City Hall and call it 'Notes.' Take EVERYTHING down here, including prices, history, and any ideas you suddenly get for the future. \n Get a job and make money. If someone needs something like a textbook or a folder, or if someone moves in and decides to buy a house, who ever they bought that from gets the money, and also pays his employees. Don't forget, play everyone's emotions and personalities, for example, if you make someone not pay an employee, that person's probably going to quit their job. \n For example, I found Windows Movie Maker, and, after a while, I researched it, and being creative, made a Movie Studio, and eventually a TV Station, and TV's themselves. Soon everyone had a TV. 3 others and I were large directors, made a lot of movies, and a TV series. Easy way to become rich, ,
 Firstly, you need two pans for this, one for the veg/chili/garlic and one for the meat. \n Put only a teaspoon or two of oil (preferable groundnut oil, but it doesn't matter) in the veg pan, once hot, add the chopped chili first, this infuses the oil with the chili heat and flavor. The first thing you put in the pan is essential. \n \n if you don't have the seeds, and you only have the powder, then add a touch of this now instead, not all at this stage. \n \n You don't need a lot of oil at all, as the meat gives off some good juices. The meat starts to sweat the fat off itself as it starts to brown, once this has happened, pour 95% of the fat juice from the meat into the veg pan, so essentially, the veg is now cooking in meat fats. They soak up that flavor and make them really really tasty!! \n Next put some more of the cumin into the veg, not all of it, and a little bit of salt and black pepper. \n You want the lamb (or if you really want to use beef, go ahead) to be brown but not burnt, keep it moving, sprinkle a touch of cumin on the meat, stir it round, remember, you don't need it 100% cooked, as you're still gonna be stewing it a little later on. \n Making sure you don't overcook it here is key to keeping the tenderness of the lamb. \n Once the meat is at a point you're happy with, and the veg is nicely softened a little (the peppers won't soften so much but they are now packed full of flavor and burst in your mouth when you eat them), add the meat to the veg, or veg to the meat, which ever pan is bigger. \n Add your chopped tomatoes and your chili kidney beans stir around and add all the cumin now, don't be shy with it, it's what gives a good chili real flavor. Add a decent amount of black pepper and salt to taste. \n At this point, depending on how confident you feel you can try experimenting with a few different flavors, you could grate a little nutmeg in now, add a touch of paprika or even cinnamon. Feel free to experiment. \n remember do not think you've put in too little of this, as you can overdo it easily. 10drops max. \n Also works well with tortilla chips, sour cream , and garlic bread. \n The grated carrot and onion give it texture too and the soft lamb is delicious, and because of the RED beans and general red color of the dish, and the YELLOW peppers, and the GREEN peppers, that's why I've named it "Traffic Light Chili". \n
 A container that has previously been opened may be difficult to open if the cap/lid is sealed tight with resin exposed to air. \n Find out the date the can was bottled because resin has a short shelf life; even in sealed, airtight containers, it can become too viscous to effectively coat foliage and flowers.\n It is important to find resin fluid that can be sprayed or air brushed through the nozzle or sprayer bottle directly to the foliage and flowers. \n If the resin is too viscous to be sprayed onto the flower you can carefully sprinkle and pour small drops at a time (This will be further explained below). \n \n Avoid breathing resin fumes. Resin has an extremely potent smell and just a small amount poured can fill a house with the smell for hours. \n Resin can cure and set quickly jamming and plugging your sprayer permanently if you don't disassemble and clean right away., The container bottle should have an information chart with the proper resin/catalyst ratio depending of the size and thickness of the cast., Pay close attention to safety tips and warnings. \n Use caution while mixing and pouring solutions. When resin makes contact with the catalyst there is a chemical reaction which creates significant heat. \n The thinner and closer the petals and leaves are to each other will be more difficult to cast. \n Some leaves and flowers are more difficult to cast because they are more delicate and could stick and clog-up to other leaves and petals. \n Excessive heat and heavy resin layers could cause flowers to to curl, discolor and wrinkle. \n \n It is difficult to spray with resin, you can dip thicker and less dense foliage and hang them dry with good results. \n
 Just because you have a business that you want to operate does not mean that a corporation is the best decision. You should consider the legal options that exist for a business operation in Georgia:Corporation. A corporation can exist for profit, or as a non-profit, or as a professional corporation (PC). The main reason for choosing to incorporate is to separate yourself and your personal assets from the assets and obligations of the business.Limited Liability Company (LLC). An LLC offers convenience, because you report the income of the business in your own tax return. But it also limits personal liability in the way that a corporation does.Sole proprietorship. A sole proprietorship is convenient because you operate the business on your own, without any additional legal organization. You report all profits and losses in your own tax returns. However, you are personally responsible for all of the business’s obligations and liabilities.Partnership. A partnership is legally similar to a sole proprietorship, but more than one person operates the business. The partners each receive their share of the income and assume their share of the company’s obligations. All income and losses are reported in personal tax returns.\n Once you have made the decision to incorporate, your new corporation needs a name. According to Georgia law, your business name must be “distinguishable” from the names of other existing corporations.When you select a name, you can reserve it online at http://ecorp.sos.ga.gov. There is an application fee of $25, which you can pay with a credit card. \n You may also download the name reservation form at http://sos.ga.gov/corporations/acrobat/applications/Form%20-%20Name%20Reservations.pdf and mail it in with the $25 payment. \n After you reserve your name, you have 30 days to complete the remaining steps for incorporation. After 30 days, the name is no longer reserved, and someone else may select it. \n Within 90 days after filing your Articles of Incorporation, you must file an initial annual registration form with the Secretary of State. This form must identify three officers of your corporation. There is a filing fee of $50 for this report.The link for filing this report through the Georgia Corporations Division website is https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/ARForm. \n In Georgia, anyone planning to incorporate a business must publish a notice of intent in the newspaper that is the “official legal organ” of the county where the business is located. You can find a list of these official newspapers at www.gsccca.org/clerks. You can prepare this ahead of time, but it must be filed no later than the day after you file your Articles of Incorporation.The notice can be a simple letter that reads, “Dear Publisher, Please publish once a week, for two consecutive weeks, a notice in the following form: Notice is given that articles of incorporation that will incorporate (Name of Corporation) have been delivered to the Secretary of State for filing in accordance with the Georgia Business Corporation Code. The initial registered office of the corporation is located at (Address) and its initial registered agent is (Name of agent). A check in the amount of $40 is enclosed.” \n If you are filing as a non-profit corporation, you must still publish the notice of incorporation. In the notice, you will refer to the Georgia Non-Profit Corporation Code rather than the Georgia Business Corporation Code. \n You may or may not be required to have an EIN to operate your business. Contact the IRS at 866-816-2065 or research their website at www.irs.ustreas.gov., According to Georgia law, the Articles of Incorporation must include certain minimal information. The law only sets out the required minimums for the Articles of Incorporation to be filed. You may want to consult with legal counsel to decide if you wish to include more., This must be the same name, exactly, as you previously reserved. The name must include some form of “Incorporated,” “Corporation,” “Inc.,” or some clear indication that the business is a corporation., If your corporation operates for profit, you must include in the Articles of Incorporation the number of shares that the corporation will be authorized to issue. This does not need to be a number that is being issued immediately. You may need to consult with legal counsel on certain strategies and options related to issuing corporate shares.You can create different "classes" of stock shares, with each class having different rights or privileges. For example, one class of shares may have voting rights while another does not. \n The Articles of Incorporation need to define the classes of shares that will be authorized and the number of shares in each class., This is for non-profit corporations only. Instead of issuing shares, a non-profit corporation may have “members.” The members of a non-profit corporation generally have voting rights in directing the actions of the corporation. Your Articles of Incorporation must report whether you intend to define membership, and, if so, how many members are anticipated., This must be the legal address where the corporation will receive mail and legal notices. It may or may not be the same address as the location of actual business operations., Every corporation must have at least one registered agent. The agent may or may not be an officer or an incorporator of the corporation. The agent must be someone who is identifiable to receive legal notices and mail for the corporation., The incorporators may or may not serve as officers of the corporation. These are the individuals who have served in preparing the Articles of Incorporation. Personal addresses for each incorporator must be included., The principal office is the location where the actual operations of the corporation take place. This may or may not be the same as the registered address., The official website, https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/, provides links to a wide variety of useful information for doing business in Georgia. Electronic filing is a good idea because your submission will be checked for completeness as you go through the process. You will not be able to file if your information is incomplete. \n There are several options available to you. To being a filing, you will choose the button for “Online Services.”, If this is your first time using the Corporations Division website, you will be prompted to create an account. If you have already created an account, then you can simply enter your log-in ID and password.If you are creating a new account, you will be asked for your name, address, and email address. You will be prompted to select a log-in ID name and a password. \n After you create your account, you will be taken to the Online Services dashboard screen. This lists approximately 20 different options for next steps. Select the button to “Create or Register a Business.”, If this is a new corporation, you will select “I am creating a new domestic business.” If your corporation has already been operating in another state and you wish to do business in Georgia, you will select “I am registering a foreign business.”, The next series of screens will prompt you to enter the information that is contained in your Articles of Incorporation. Answer the questions as they arise, as completely as possible., After you have answered all the questions, you will see a final printout of your information. Review it for accuracy before making the final submission. This will become your Articles of Incorporation. You will be able to amend the filing later, if any errors are identified, but it is much easier at this stage., After all your information is filed and verified, you will be prompted to pay the filing fee with a credit card. The filing fee is $100., This is your formal notice from the Georgia Corporations Division that your submission has been accepted and filed, and that your corporation is eligible to operate in Georgia. Within five to seven business days after you submit your articles online, you will receive an email that your filing has been accepted. You should print that email and keep a copy with your official corporate records., If you are submitting a paper copy of the Articles of Incorporation, you must type the information on standard, white, 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper. The document should be titled, “Articles of Incorporation of (Name) Corp.” Each separate piece of information should be listed as a separate “Article.”, The articles must be signed by one or more of the incorporators, or by the corporation’s attorney, if one is identified.

  Just close your eyes and write what comes to mind as you think the word, "autumn."\n  Ads closely track trends and are illustrated with nice photographs.  Newspapers list fall events.  Clothing ads show cooler weather apparel.  Keep these pictures as references as you work.,  Either format will work well and give you an opportunity to fill the space with many of your favorite fall things. \n Use a pencil and break up the space on the entire paper.  Make various shapes. \n The possibilities are endless, but go back to your list of words and clipping for inspiration. \n  In another space, draw a fallen leaf.  Add apples on branches in another space and keep going until all frames are filled.,  If desired, use a set of watercolors with dry pads you need to moisten and activate with water.  You could also use water-soluable or regular colored pencils.  Colored markers would be fun, too.  Or, do a mixture of all those media. \n  This is an opportunity to showcase the warm colors;  orange, red, red-violet, gold, rust, brown and yellow.  Contrast them with the cooler ones from the opposite side of the color wheel.  Blue, green, blue-violet, an an array of neutrals from pale gray to black.  These will highlight the warmer, brighter colors. \n  Use the brightest and boldest colors to bring out the subject of each rectangle.  Then color the backgrounds for each, working right up to the border. \n  How detailed to make your painting is up to you.  Any approach you pick is acceptable and will show your own personality and style. \n  Either black Sharpie or permanent colored markers.  A small, pointed brush can be used for detail work, too. \n  Take a look at your work from a distance and decide what to do with the white paper around the mini-paintings.  Anything you do is fine, including leaving it unpainted.  An all-over treatment of color will unify your page. \n  Paint another color, up to three, layers over thoroughly dry paint.  Or, to remove color, use a scrub brush or a piece of white kitchen cleaning sponge called a Magic Eraser., As the paper dries, the piece will brighten but the watercolors will appear slightly fainter.  Go back in at this point and heighten any colors that need it, add more detail, and remember to intermingle colors throughout the scene.  Do this by touching small areas with the color of another area.,  Don't be sad if you can't really have haystacks, scarecrows or smoking leaf piles at hand because through art, all things are possible.  Even a row of noisy crows.
 Start with short intervals and increase the time with the bunny. Consider placing a nice plate of greens out for the rabbit to eat while you stroke the rabbit to decrease any potential anxiety. \n Don't make sudden moves or sounds that might alarm your rabbit. Be gentle and soothing when you pet the rabbit. Rabbits are prey animals, so when they feel threatened, they run and hide if they can. \n Sit on the floor to minimize your size and avoid towering over the bunny.\n Never pick up a rabbit by his ears, legs, or tail.Rabbits are very delicate and you could severely injure them if you pick them up incorrectly.Grabbing on to limbs, tails, or ears will cause the rabbit to react by pulling away. Doing so may cause a fracture or a dislocation or tearing of underlying muscle and soft tissue.A bunny new to the household should be picked up and restrained by adults at first. Children can pet the bunny while it is on the floor or while sitting in the child’s (or adult’s) lap sitting on the floor. \n Staying close to the ground for a while is a good preventative measure. Should the rabbit try to escape, they will not fall a long distance and potentially injure themselves. \n Reward the rabbit with a treat afterward. This will help it get used to the feeling of being picked up., Do not pick the rabbit up by the scruff alone, but use this as a handle to prevent forward motion while you use your other hand arm to tuck the hind legs under the bunny and scrunch the bunny in a gentle “bunny ball.” \n Your free hand that is not holding the scruff should be placed on the bunny’s rump. You should roll the back legs underneath, toward the front of the bunny, holding the feet up with your hand. This will prevent the rabbit from kicking out and potentially injuring itself. \n There are differing opinions on whether or not to scruff a rabbit. Scruffing, done gently, does not injure the rabbit., Place one under his chest and one under its behind. The positioning should be comfortable for both you and the rabbit. Make sure you have a firm (but not tight) grip on the rabbit's body so that it doesn't leap from your hands when you lift. \n Make sure to contain the hind legs securely, by keeping your hand on the rump and scrunching the hind legs up toward the bunny’s head. Remember, you are holding the hind legs so that they point forward, toward the head, the opposite direction of where the hind legs would be should the bunny kick out. \n It may help to kneel to get closer to the rabbit, so you don't have to bend and lift. Get down on the ground with the rabbit. \n It's best to lift a rabbit either from a top-opening cage or a confined area in your house. It can be much more difficult to lift a rabbit from a side opening cage. Rabbits will often run and hide when approached, so trying to pick up a rabbit in a room with lots of furniture will also be difficult. \n When removing a rabbit from a side or front opening carrier, do so with the hind legs first out of the opening. That way, if they get out of your grip, they will jump back into the carrier and not down to the ground.Use one hand to hold the bunny’s head away from you, toward the back of the cage, while gently holding on to the scruff. The other hand is used over the bunny’s rump to scrunch the hind legs up into the “bunny ball” hold. Then lift the bunny out, hind legs toward you, and place under your arm so the bunny’s head is given a place to hide. \n If you are getting the bunny out of a top-opening carrier, you can use the same technique, just remember not to dangle the bunny by the scruff. \n If this is a well handled and calm bunny, you are likely to be able to safely pick up the bunny with one hand under its chest and one hand scrunching the rump, without holding on to the scruff. \n Be aware, that if the bunny feels like it might fall, it will struggle and kick and try to get down. If this happens, place the bunny back in the carrier and re-grip or go back to using the scruff to help with restraint. \n If your rabbit tends to run under furniture, coax it out with a treat before trying to pick it up. Better yet, manage the area to prevent the rabbit from being able to get away and hide so that it doesn't have access to hiding places that are difficult for you to access. Try using an exercise pen to confine the bunny, but still allowing them an area large enough to hop around. \n Never pull on a rabbit's legs or tail to get it to move closer to you. It is better to gently get a hold of the scruff to prevent the rabbit from getting away, then you can get an arm around the rabbit’s body and contain the hind legs. Never forcefully scruff a rabbit or dangle it by the scruff. This will cause the rabbit injury. \n If a rabbit thumps a hind leg when you approach, be aware that this is a warning to you that you are in their territory and they are not thrilled with your presence. The rabbit may be more difficult to handle, so be prepared. \n Again, remember to use confinement within an exercise pen or other area to help you manage the rabbit’s access to hiding places and allow you find and restrain the rabbit more easily. \n Do not point its head down because the rabbit may then try to jump down, out of your arms, and may hurt itself. \n The rabbit will feel more secure being able to hide a bit. Your rabbit should be held and carried securely under your arm, nestled comfortably under your “wing.”Some people call this the “football hold.” \n If you are right handed, place the bunny’s head under your left arm. Wrap your left arm around the outside of the rabbit while using your left hand to continue to securely hold the rabbit’s hind legs under it. \n Place your right hand gently over the bunny’s neck, ready to get a hold of the scruff should the bunny move suddenly. \n Do not hold your rabbit extended outward or swing it through the air. \n Ideally, place the rabbit on a table and restrain it while the other person gets a hold of the bunny. Don't try to pass the bunny in mid air. This could lead to the rabbit getting loose and falling from a great height. \n If you ever feel like you are losing control when carrying the rabbit, immediately crouch down to the ground or to a table to decrease the distance that it might fall. This will also give you a surface upon which to regroup and re-grip the bunny. \n Some rabbits really dislike being handled and no amount of treats or petting will change their personalities. For these types, it's best to use a carrying case to move them from one place to the next, rather than attempting to pick them up. \n Use one hand to hold the scruff to restrain the rabbit and get your other hand on the rump and “scrunch” the bunny in a “bunny ball” to transfer to the carrier. \n Be sure to keep a firm grip the entire time, because rabbits tend to try to jump once they can see the floor. \n This method decreases the chance of the bunny kicking out and injuring itself., After spending time in your arms without biting or leaping away, your obedient rabbit deserves a treat. Gently pet it as you give it a reward. The rabbit will realize that being picked up isn't so bad, and next time it may even go more smoothly. \n 
, You can also store this in your frig in an old pickle jar or something until use, in which you just add to your stock pot for extra flavoring \n Just keep a good inventory of your frig and make it a point not to throw away any thing edible, or what was once seen as inedible ? \n Even if the chicken breasts have been fully devoured, save them anyway, and add with lots of vegetables and spices ? \n \n Cook this until the garlic is a medium brown, and just remove the garlic slices and add to stock. Continue cooking remaining vegetables with a teaspoon of liquid smoke until veges are well brown, then add them to stock. \n You can dish out and save the yams and carrots, which can be mashed and used to thicken soups if you please, or they can be mashed up in the stock pot with a potato masher, for they have absorbed the flavorings of all vegetables, meats, and aromatic spices. This is another great method in this process: After 1 hour of cooking at a medium simmer, remove chicken bones, then microwave the bones for 6 minutes at 3 minute intervals, then put bones in a bowl mesh strainer and set back in stock and let simmer for the remainder 30 minutes ( this will bring out a hearty chicken flavor in the soup, then you can place bones back in microwave an cook for an additional 3 minutes to dry them out, then add them to your vegetable garden or toss out. You can also add them in a heavy iron pot and mash them up into powder before adding to your garden. \n One can also use cheesecloth to strain out the pulp to, but the metal mesh screen is easier. \n You can put the cubes in a bowl and microwave, or just put in pot then add a little more water, vegetables, meats, beans, spinach, diced tomatoes, corn, rice, and cook for another 30 minutes or so. \n
 There is no doubt that it is absolutely simple. You will need: \n 1 Rubber Band \n 1 Sheet of Paper \n Scissors or Ruler (Optional)\n Take your piece of paper. Cut or tear the piece of paper into smaller pieces with your hands, scissors, ruler, etc. The small papers should be roughly near 7 cm by 1 cm. Scrunch up the small pieces of paper into a good-sized, tight and firm paper ball. This will be called a mini-paper bullet. Make a few more bullets to add to your ammo stock. \n Wrap it around your thumb and index finger. Make sure to put the rubber band on your default hand (hand that you usually use). \n Pinch it with your thumb and index finger of your other hand. Don't let go of the bullet. \n If you are pulling the closest band towards you, you are doing it correctly. \n Pull the band that is further away from you towards you. This will overlap the band that is closest towards you. Do not pull the band closest towards you. \n This time, pull both bands. \n The tricky part is coming up. Although it is easy to do practically, describing it in words is a different matter. \n Pull it under the band farthest from you. \n Hold the bullet by pinching it with your thumb and index finger of your other hand. \n That is, wrapped around your thumb and index finger. \n Twist the band you are holding and place it in the base of your middle finger. Your middle finger should be resting near the middle of your palm. \n Pull back the rubber band with the bullet. \n Whether in school, home, or work, you've got to hide your masterpiece of fun. In school, you might shoot your bullets across the room but you should hide your weapon so that people aren't suspicious of you. You certainly don't want your enemy or other people using your weapon. The best hiding spot for your bullets is your pocket. Shorts pocket, jacket pocket, all are fine. Hiding it in a pocket is another good thing because your hand could reach it easily. \n Pretend to be writing or pretend to be doing something with your hands. The person you shot might think that your working hands means that it is too busy for games. \n The rubber band makes a twanging sound after firing the bullet so it is a good idea to hide it quickly. If you have a watch, you could use it to cover up your rubber band. Or else you put it inside a pocket or put it next to other bracelets or things on your arm to make it look like everyday stuff. \n You might not get it to shoot well at first, but remember to place the bullet in the right place so the power will go into the bullet. Don't forget to read the tips below to learn more \n 
\n Never wear make-up, although if you have freckles, you might want to use some foundation to cover them up. \n Gold has a wealthy aura. Owning one decent piece is better than a box full of junk pieces. Earrings should be little gold or silver studs, or maybe precious gems. Use real pearls; these are the only acceptable sort for the wealthy look. \n Just because you got some clothes from an upper class store doesn't mean they are preppy. Buy clothes that are classic, and clean-cut. Don't be afraid to splurge on these a little, as preps tend to hold onto clothes for a long time. Remember to make sure your clothes are always clean, and always match. Good fabrics are very important. Get rid of any polyester. Buy mostly 100%cotton, wool and cashmere. Wear preppy colors. Bright and happy, like green, pink, light blue, nautical red, white and navy blue and preppy patterns such as plaid, stripes, gingham, polka dots, argyle, floral, paisley, nova checks, and tartan. \n Here are some suggestions for that type of clothing: \n Polo shirts \n Oxford shirts (unlike polos, oxford shirts should always be long-sleeved if it is warm outside simply roll up the sleeves) \n Rugby shirt \n Cable-knit vests and sweaters (traditional cricket sweaters) \n A jacket or blazer (navy blue is a staple; try seersucker or madras plaid in summer, tweed in winter) \n Chino pants-could have cuffs \n Khaki pants. The prep equivalent to jeans \n Bermuda shorts (khaki, madras plaid, seersucker, linen or preppy prints and patterns) \n Skirts (khaki, madras plaid, seersucker, linen, preppy prints and patterns) \n Tea dresses and summer dresses (in madras plaid, preppy colors, seersucker, or linen). A-line dresses, halters, and flowy dresses are acceptable. \n Tennis- and golf-inspired shirts, skirts, and dresses \n Know the right stores and the right things to buy. Go to outlet malls where clothing is a bit cheaper than at the retail stores. Tommy Hilfiger, Abercrombie and Fitch, Armani Exchange and even Dolce and Gabbana clothing can be purchased for a lower price. Also, check wholesale stores that sell gently used clothing for a much cheaper price then at the actually store(check tips for a minor addition to this section). \n If you're unsure about how to put together outfits, Google "preppy outfits". \n Remember to always be clean: run a comb through your hair, keep your nails dirt-free and neat, brush your teeth and bathe/shower. When spraying perfume, be sure to use just enough, but not too much. Excessive use of perfume isn't attractive and does not improve your hygiene, despite popular belief. Being clean is important; being grubby isn't classy and isn't pleasing. \n It will make you look, annoying, and is sometime insulting to real Brits. \n If you want to be like the one from "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" the 2005 film, don't worry too much about it. \n Did someone use the last napkin? Did someone forget to put the toothpaste cap back on? Remember that you're only pretending; there's no reason to flip a table over a pretend grudge \n Otherwise, your bad reputation (see warnings) may make people accuse them of being "drunk." \n Always have it on you. \n Most people will be jealous if you have money and no worries in life. Get good grades, look nice, act nice, and always enjoy yourself when you're out. Never tell people about "bad things" in your life, this will make people think they are better than you if they have something you don't. If someone has something you don't have or is going somewhere nice, than don't act like it is a big deal, just stay cool, make it seem like it is something normal in your life. \n Post adds on a neighborhood website offering babysitting and pet sitting. If you have a lawnmower, offer to mow peoples lawns or rake leaves. Do something to get money whether that is simply asking your granny or you having to work for it. \n Work really hard at your schoolwork and make sure you get grades no lower than 'B+'. If you do, pout and kick up a fuss (but not to the teacher!) A 'C' is unacceptable! \n It is a must. Use big words. Rich people are often well-educated and thus have good vocabularies. Learn a new word every day like "aberrant," "culpable," or "capricious." Having a vocabulary like this increases charm and wit, which can be considered a MUST in higher circles. \n Aside from good hygiene, you have to dress classy/posh. T shirts and sweatpants will not cut it. A golf shirt and plaid shorts will work at the least, or some designer. If you cannot afford a lot of designer clothes, get some "minor designer" clothing. Some examples are Isaac Mizrahi, Mossimo, etc. A bit cheap sometimes, but some will work. \n Some good wardrobe basics would be a Louis Vuitton handbag, a Burberry scarf and a pair of pearls or diamonds. Also, convince your dad to dress well. Some good choices would be Lacoste/Tommy Hilfiger/Nautica polo's and 2 or 3 Pierre Cardin jackets. An Armani suit would also be good. If you can't afford all these, just convince them to look elegant. \n When friends come over, make your ordinary house look 'rich' by printing poster sized pictures of famous paintings, or you and your family dressed in beautiful clothes, or your parents' wedding and frame them. Then hang them up. On your desk keep all your things neat and tidy. Have a pink or white bedspread, and for your computer, put a cover, (pink or white), over it. The house should be tidy. \n As cliched as it sounds, learn about wines and cheeses. Learn how to pronounce words like Béchamel and Beaujolais. And learn good table manners. Otherwise you will look like a complete fool at dinnertime. Read etiquette books(American Girl is good). \n Having a coffee or tea at hand also makes you look rich. \n
 For the most part, the interesting information that a chemist seeks are electronic energies of atoms and molecules. The calculation can also predict if the compound is stable enough to be existent.\n These orbitals are responsible for the chemical characteristics of the molecules, namely whether they will react with other molecules or not and by which symmetry. \n They are difficult to calculate accurately due to the involvement of many atoms in their molecular structure. However, organic compounds which have small number of atoms are relatively easy to calculate due to the low electron count in them. \n In particular, the interaction between the LUMO of one compound and the HOMO of the other reactant are important. The difference in energetics between these two orbitals as well as the matching of the symmetry will dictate if there will be a reaction between these two compounds. Therefore, it is important to perform calculations on the energetics of these orbitals and not on the inner core orbitals in order to verify if there will be a reaction between these two molecules or not. \n This equation is nonrelativistic and does not account for relativistic effects such as the phenomenon of the spin. The quantum mechanical variant of this equation that involves relativistic effects on atoms and molecules is called the Dirac equation. \n For atomic systems it is solved only for the hydrogen atom in an exact manner. In this case also the solution involves formidable mathematical equations that involve laplacian in spherical coordinates. In addition, it involves also differential equations that are not straightforward to solve for the practitioner chemist. \n For this reason many efforts were done in order to overcome this difficulty by deriving several approximation methods that are called perturbative methods. They involve solving the the energy term of the perturbation itself and then adding it to the general energy of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. \n This is especially important for many electron atoms and molecules. In many electron atoms there are two main perturbations that prevent from solving the Schroedinger equation in an exact manner. These are: the correlation between electrons or the repulsion forces between the various electrons which add a term to the Hamiltonian that makes the mathematics impossible for solving the problem. This electronic correlation is manifested not only in many electrons atoms but also in all molecules. \n It originates due to the relative motion of the nucleus around the electron itself. The movement of the nucleus around the electron generates a magnetic field that can interact with the spin and angular magnetic moment of the electron, thus giving rise to an additional term in the atomic Hamiltonian that impedes an accurate solution of the Schroedinger equation. \n Nowadays there are many perturbative methods such as the Muller plesset method which includes correlation between electrons in the Hamiltonian. In addition a popular method that is being used more and more in computational chemistry is the density functional theory which has the advantage of being less time consuming than the other methods. Additional computational methods especially useful for transition state calculations include the coupled cluster methods. for thermodynamic calculations a very efficient method is the semi-empirical method especially the PM3 method. \n 
, PWC engines can suck rocks and debris from the bottom in shallow waters resulting in a damaged or clogged impeller. Never operate a PWC in shallow water. \n All boats which are underway and up on-plane are required to be AT LEAST 100 feet (30.5 m) from other boats and AT LEAST 150 feet (45.7 m) from shore or docks. The same rules apply to PWCs. \n Boats generally travel in a consistent linear pattern whereas PWC operators often ride in impulsive, erratic "freestyle" patterns of S curves, circles and figure eights, which substantially increase the potential for collision with a boat and may run afoul of the "rules of the road". \n Spatial disorientation and inattention can quickly result by being lost in the moment but increase the risk of being hit by another boat after having quickly but unwittingly maneuvered the PWC directly into the path of another boat's immediate strike zone. Freestyle riding that includes radical maneuvers, high-speed spins, carves, jumps and tricks should be performed in a non-residential cove or remote area of the lake that is not subject to frequent boat traffic. \n Many other people came to the same place for peace and quiet. If it appears that PWC usage is infringing upon the rights of others to have solace, then ride to areas away from other people where no one will be disrupted. Being a public nuisance puts the entire sport at risk for everyone to face PWC bans and heighten restrictions. \n Respect begets respect. \n 
 The only supplies you "need" on the things you'll need list is the light hair and markers, though it is highly recommended that you at least have the comb or brush. \n Section the hair you want to be coloured. You don't need to tie it back or pin it up, but get a basic idea of how much hair is going to receive a part of each colour you have. Flat-iron the whole section of hair before you colour it (optional, but convenient.), If you are worried about the colour getting on your face/head, fold up a paper towel and put it under the hair you are colouring. This also makes colouring the ends more convenient for you., It will not remove the colour, but your hair may get sticky and slightly matted, and the combing helps to remove the stickiness as you go., For most of the colours, you can just blend with what is next to it, but the pink and the yellow are exceptions. Grab a small section of hair that is half part of red and half part of pink, and simply colour with the pink until the colours look blended., The orange will only mask the colour, make your sections uneven, and not blend anyway., (If you have any more colours than are described here, use the same pattern of blending with the lighter colour.),
, Set aside. \n Allow butter to melt. \n Stir slowly. \n The masticha and machlepi will be difficult to remove entirely from the mortar and pestle, but try to extricate as much as possible. \n Prepare to use this in a later argument with friends about being more “cultured” than they. \n Resist urge to add extra flour, as the mixture is supposed to feel less cohesive than normal bread dough. \n The shape must be circular, but there is no exact method of placement, so design as you so choose. \n\n This is the prize money for whoever finds the coin in their slice. \n Guests are usually included in this section. Some families include slices for pets as well!) \n Whoever finds the coin wins the prize money! \n The point of the whole ritual is to start the year off with a hopeful feeling in your heart and a smile on your face! The money CANNOT be used on something necessary or solemn in nature! The object the money purchases must be an instrument of joy. For instance, if the dime is found in the Work piece, the money should be used to buy things to decorate your office. If a pet should win the coin, go buy him/her a new toy or a few treats! \n The money should be donated the next time the family goes to church (which is usually later that day if you are Greek . \n The coin will be your good luck charm for the next 365 days! \n 
, Likely, any clinical information the drug rep may have regarding the drug samples he or she may leave you is inaccurate. \n Often, the screenings are conducted by front groups to expand the diagnostic boundaries of a particular disease state. \n Such drugs are listed in what is called an Orange Book. \n Yet such representatives should be aware that their time at your patient treatment area is limited. \n These gifts that are actually bribes are largely based on the prescriber's affinity for the drug. rep's promoted products or the volume of prescriptions a doctor writes compared with other health care providers. The potential consequences of accepting such bribes which the industry calls many things, including 'gifts', could have on the health of patients and the choices of treatment for them. Such bribing may cloud the judgment of the health care providers who receive such gifts.. \n This is of particular importance when it comes to the issue of utilizing psychotropic drugs and antibiotics, as drugs are very over-utilized in the United States. \n In other words, their idealism and passion straight out of school should be maintained, however difficult this may be at times. As a patient caregiver, you may get overwhelmed at times. \n What they may share with you about their promoted drugs is likely embellished or fabricated, if not fully understood by the medical representative. \n Remind the nurses that this should not affect the treatment and care they give their patients, as difficult as this may be for the nurses. The pharma industry only amplifies this situation in various ways at certain times and locations. To say again, do not allow others to interfere with patient care. \n
 The potsticker dough may reach a better consistency if the water is slightly warm.Boil 1/3 cup (80 mL) water, then remove from heat and add 2/3 cup (160 mL) room temperature water. \n Alternatively, heat 1 cup (240 mL) water on low heat and remove from heat after one to three minutes. If the water begins to simmer or boil, remove from heat and let cool to slightly above room temperature before using.\n While none of these ingredients are required to make guo tie, some recipes call for salt, vegetable oil, and/or egg.Stirring roughly 1/4 tsp (1 mL) salt (or a small pinch) into the water may add flavor. The other optional ingredients should be added to the flour instead, before you continue to the next step. Mix the flour with 1 tsp (5 mL) vegetable oil and/or 1 small egg to add flavor and help the dough stick together. Continue as usual, but be aware that the egg will add more liquid to the dough, so you will probably not end up using all your water in the next step. \n If this is your first time making potstickers, you may wish to skip this step to keep things simple. If the wrappers fall apart or taste too bland, you may add one or more of these ingredients in your next attempt. \n Put 2 cups (480mL) all-purpose flour into a large bowl. Add the warm water a little at a time, stirring the ingredients together with chopsticks or a wooden mixing spoon. Stop adding water once the dough feels slightly sticky, and there is no more dry flour visible. \n Depending on the brand of flour and the humidity in your kitchen, you may not need to use all of the water you prepared. Keep the extra water around during the next few steps in case the dough dries out. \n Once the dough becomes too sticky to stir, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface and knead the flour and water together. The dough should become smooth within a few minutes of kneading. Stop when the dough has no lumps and can be formed into a ball. \n Add a light dusting of flour to the work surface or your hands if the dough sticks to them. Knead in more flour if the dough is too wet to work with. \n If you see dry flour that isn't mixed into the dough, or if the dough won't stick together into a ball, add a little more warm water and knead it in. \n Remember to wash and dry your hands thoroughly before you begin kneading. \n Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or place it in a small bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a damp cloth. This will trap the moisture released by the dough and cause it to soften.Let the dough sit for at least 10 minutes, and preferably for half an hour. \n To save time, make the filling while you wait. This step does not have to be precisely timed, so return to the dough once you are done making the filling. \n Return to the dough after it's had enough time to "relax," or soften into an easily manipulated ball. Pull it apart into small pieces, each one using about 1/20th of the total dough. You may find it easier if you first divide the dough into four large pieces, then cut each of these large pieces into five smaller ones. \n Alternatively, you may use your hand to roll out the entire ball of dough into a long log 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Cut this log into discs 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide., Sprinkle flour over a flat, clean counter or cutting board to prevent the dough from sticking. Use a rolling pin to flatten each piece of dough over this surface, creating circles about 3 inches (7.5 cm) across.Use smaller circles if the dough breaks apart or looks translucent, as the dumplings may fall apart if they are rolled too thin. \n You can speed up the rolling process by using the heel of your palm to flatten each piece of dough into a roughly circular shape before you roll it out more thoroughly. \n Filling the potstickers may be easier if you keep the center of the circle thick and the outside edges thin. \n After each circle is finished, sprinkle both sides generously with flour to prevent sticking, and add it to the stack of finished dough circles. Your dumpling wrappers are now complete. \n Cover wrappers with a damp paper towel to keep them moist as you work. Once you have made the wrappers, it is best to fill them immediately before they dry out. Store unused wrappers in the fridge if you will use them within a few days, or freeze them and use any time in the next few months., Finely chop the vegetables until you have 1 cup (240 mL). While you can use any hard, leafy, green vegetables, guo tie are traditionally made using Napa cabbage or bok choy. Both of these vegetables are sometimes sold under the name "Chinese cabbage." \n If you are making vegetarian potstickers, chop 2 cups (480 mL) of vegetables instead. \n Toss the chopped cabbage in 1 tsp (5 mL) salt. Let sit five minutes while the salt draws out moisture, then drain the cabbage in a strainer or colander., To add a spicy flavor to the guo tie, peel fresh ginger and fresh garlic, then chop them finely until you have 1 tsp (5 mL) of each. Finally chop one or two stalks of green onion (scallions). \n Mix these vegetables in a large bowl containing ground or finely minced meat. In different areas of Asia, ground pork, beef, or shrimp are all commonly used, or a mixture of these. \n Wash your hands in warm, soapy water after handling raw meat to reduce the risk of exposure to harmful bacteria. Clean any surfaces or utensils that came into contact with the meat in hot, soapy water once you are done using them. \n Mix in 2 tsp (10 mL) soy sauce, 2 tsp (20 mL) sesame oil or Chinese cooking wine, and 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) pepper. There are many variations on this recipe, and you may decide to replace some seasonings or add your own. Other common options include 1/4 cup (60 mL) chicken stock or chicken broth, a dash of chili powder, or a dash of Chinese five spice powder.If you'd like to adjust the seasonings before you make the potstickers, take a small spoonful of filling and fry it in oil until it is browned through. Taste the filling and add more seasoning if necessary. \n Take one of your circular potsticker wrappings and place it on the palm of the hand you use least. \n Take approximately 1/2–1 tablespoon (7–15 mL) of filling using a spoon or chopsticks and place in the center of the potsticker wrapper. If the dough is thin or the circles of dough are small, use less filling. \n Fold the potsticker in half to make a half-moon shape, but do not press the edges completely together. Only press the center of the edges together, so the corners of the dumpling are still unattached. \n Note: If you are using storebought dumpling wrappers, use wet fingers to dampen the edges until they are soft enough to press together. \n Grasp one layer of dough at the corner with your index finger and thumb, then fold it toward the center of the potsticker edge, where the two sides of the circle are pressed together.The soft dough should stretch into a classic potsticker pleat or wrinkle. Press the two layers of dough together at the fold to keep it in place. \n Using the same technique, grasp one layer of dough at the corner and fold it over toward the center edge. Press together with the opposite layer of the potsticker. Repeat this until there are three or four folds on each potsticker, and the potsticker is completely closed. \n Add cooking oil to a wok, flat skillet, or frying pan, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Heat over medium heat until the oil begins to shimmer, or when a small piece of vegetable or filling sizzles when placed in the oil. \n Use a vegetable oil with a high smoking point, such as canola oil or peanut oil. \n Carefully drop the potstickers into the pan from a short distance above the oil. Arrange them with a heat-safe utensil so the dumplings are close together but do not touch each other.You will likely need to cook your potstickers in several batches. Do not pile potstickers on top of each other in the pan, or they may not cook properly. \n Cover the pan, reduce to low heat, and fry for a few minutes until the bottom of the potstickers are crisp and golden-brown. Depending on the temperature of the pan, this could take anywhere from two to seven minutes.You may lift the lid to check on the potstickers' progress. \n Remove from heat immediately if you smell burning. Use a heat-safe utensil to unstick the potstickers from the pan, and continue after one or two minutes. \n Once one side of the potstickers are brown, lift the lid and pour 1–3 tablespoons (15–45 mL) water onto the pan, just enough to cover the base of the pan with a shallow layer. \n Pour the water while rapidly moving in a circular motion around the edge of the pan. This distributes the water evenly and prevents one part of the pan from cooling down too quickly. This also reduces splatter from hot oil and water coming into contact. \n Cover the pan again and cook on moderate or low heat for 4-5 minutes. Add more water if it boils away before the potstickers are done cooking. Note that you do not need to flip the potstickers at any point in this process; it is intentional that they are only crisp on one side. \n Remove a potsticker and cut it open to check that it is done. The filling inside should be browned and fully cooked. \n Remove the potstickers from the pan and cook additional batches if necessary. Once all the potstickers are cooked, serve them with a sauce of your choice: \n Any dark vinegar can be used alone or mixed with an equal amount of soy sauce and a dash of sesame oil. \n Mix vinegar with sherry or dry wine and sweet soy sauce for a sweeter dipping sauce. \n Black pepper and sliced ginger add a sophisticated flavor, and can be provided with or without a dipping sauce.
 Election rules and dates for precinct official election are somewhat different for each of the 50 state. \n Your precinct has workers from your neighborhood who make themselves available in each neighborhood. Someone will or can represent the political party at each precinct primary (or caucus) in most areas. \n Some precincts are not organized by one or the other of the parties. Such precincts (without many of your party) may yet yield your yeoman base of operation to get involved and may encourage more voters in your precinct to help county, state and national results for your party. \n Sometimes the official and the poll workers are mostly friends (from an interested political group, club or religious group) or may be unacquainted individuals with the same cause and may support one another in any case. \n Some officials and delegates may have been doing this for many years. Some get involved after retiring from the daily job. \n For example, for the winter and spring of each even year – and so be sure when the deadlines are exactly. \n State law governs how parties qualify to be recognized as parties, and that is often only the Democratic and Republican parties, as they meet the rules for signatures and the number or percent of votes that have been received by them for state party. The Democratic and Republican party are established and control all 50 states and all 3141 counties. One may pick either the Democratic or Republican party with regard to running for precinct offices. \n Ask them what precinct number you live in, and they will tell you. You can also find this out for yourself by getting the “Precinct Finder” for your county. This is a book that lists all streets AND what precinct each is in. Some streets are in one precinct for a certain range of addresses and another precinct for another range of addresses such as: Oak Avenue addresses 2000 to 4012 are in Precinct 101; Oak Avenue addresses 4013 to 5180 are in Precinct 102, and so forth. \n They will tell you where and how to get this information. \n If you get a run around in any way, call your state Secretary of State, and ask them how to find the state laws that govern the precinct elections and the parties who have qualified to be recognized by your state in that period. Such questions are matter of state law. You can double check the rules regarding running from precinct executive by looking it up for yourself on the state website in many states in your state Legal Code. \n So if you are running in the Republican Party you may need the valid signatures of ten registered Republicans or of those who are registered as independent work in that precinct. For instance, you declare your party by voting on the party ballot that you choose at the even year primary. \n Each party has a separate ballot and you legally may vote for only one party in the primary which is choosing the candidates for the fall general election. So if you have chosen to vote a Democratic ballot when you voted in the spring primary in 2008 -- then you are classified as a registered democrat until 2010, when you may change that. \n Your precinct has set boundaries as does your county and state. Your precinct may be parts of 10 or 15 streets around your house in your town or the roads in a rural area. The map may be an aerial view of your precinct. \n Where your precinct begins or ends is found on the walking list which will show you the addresses on each street or road. \n The walking list tells you who are the registered voters in your precinct, whether they are registered as Republicans, Democrats, or Independents (or registered in another party qualified in your state, such as the Libertarian Party, Green Party, or Constitution Party, for instance). \n)\n When you must have turned in your valid petition to the Board of Elections (for example: is that no later than 30 or is that 45 days before the primary?)\n (For instance, in your State if the Primary is on May 7th, the time to pick up your official precinct petition may begin 90 days earlier which is around February 7th, and the last day to turn it back in might be 30 days before the primary around April 7th. Turn it in a little earlier of course.) \n If you have met the required number of valid signatures – then your name will be on the official ballot for only that one election in your precinct, on your party ballot, for that specific primary held in your state. \n If you are unopposed for Precinct (executive) in your precinct for your party, then if at least you vote for yourself, then you win. If others have collected the required number of signatures to run for precinct executive in your precinct in your party, then they will also be on the ballot running against you. \n For more than one candidate -- the candidate who gets the most votes (plurality - not necessary to be the majority) at the primary wins, and earns the right to go to the "County Party Organizational Meeting" a few weeks or a month or so later (at a local community center, VFW Hall, convention center, or wherever it is to be held) – and vote on who will makeup the Party Chairman and Party Executive Committee for your party in your county for the next 2 years.This may also be called the "neighborhood precinct chair strategy" by which you may begin to take over at the grassroots in America: precinct-by-precinct, county-by-county, state-by-state, and then your nation... through the all important Ballot Box. \n 
 There are many to choose from, and, depending on company and features, there are a multitude of programs out there that will help guide you through the rest of the Internet.\n If there is no such setting by that name, you can easily find it elsewhere in Windows. \n This will open up another dialog box. \n This should open up a place where, you yourself can set whatever programs you'd like to enable/show/use. \n And ensure that the other program you'd like to use remains enabled (checked). \n This should list the available options you can choose from, such as My Documents, My Pictures, My Music, etc. \n This will bring up yet another dialog box. \n \n If the option for "Classic Menu" is highlighted, you don't need to read any further. Close these boxes and cancel. The top section will work. Open your program and make the browser you want the default. Upon first load, many browsers will ask whether or not you'd like to make the program the default browser. \n \n Upon opening many other browsers for the first time, they'll ask you whether you want to make them the default. This is another place to find this option (of making a browser the default). \n If not, you'll need to continue onwards with these steps. \n Click the box to open it. \n \n If there is no Ok button, you may just close the window to save your work. \n 
 This simple method ensures the vest will be a good fit without the hassle of measurements, etc.\n Seam allowance is the part that gets folded under when you make the seams. , For each half, fold the t-shirt in half vertically and trace around it, adding seam allowance along the outer edge plus a little extra room for the front-center overlap if desired (e.g., where you'd put snaps or buttons). \n Again, add room (1/2 inch) for the seam allowance. Keep in mind the back may have a higher neckline than the front pieces, depending on your design. \n Put the cutout pieces together as they would be for the vest, making sure the armholes and hem line up., You'll need at least 1 to 1 1/2 yards for the vest, and an equal amount for the lining. \n The lining is the part that goes inside the vest, on the reverse side of the outer cloth. \n If you have doubts as to how much fabric you need, take your pattern to the fabric or craft store and ask for help. It's always better to have a bit extra material than not enough. \n You can choose from a wide range of materials for your vest. Keep in mind the season when selecting your fabric; for example, you can use a light wool for autumn, velvet for winter, seersucker for spring, and silk or light cotton for summer. \n On a large working surface, lay the fabric out. Place the cutout patterns on top, pinning them together to avoid slippage. Use a pen to trace the outline onto the fabric. \n Remove the pattern pieces and use a pen to mark a dotted line around the fabric about 1/2 inch from the edge (your seam allowance). You'll follow this line when you sew up the vest., When you've finished this, check that the lining pieces line up with the vest pieces. \n At this point, you are not sewing the lining to the vest, but rather working on the two parts separately.Right sides together (RST) means that the insides of your seam – the parts touching each other – are the right sides of the cloth (the part with the pattern and/or the one that will be seen in the finished product), while the wrong sides are showing outside.At this point, it may be helpful to press the seams flat with an iron if your fabric allows. \n Line up the vest and lining pieces, making sure the side seams and shoulder openings match up. Pin them together and sew along all sides except the shoulder seams (the part at the top between the neck and shoulder openings)., At this point, the right side of the fabric should be visible for both liner and vest. \n First fold the top 1/2 inch of the back shoulder piece under, then tuck the front piece in. Place a pin at either end of the shoulder seam and sew together on the back piece, about 1/8 inch from the edge. Repeat for the other shoulder seam. \n While for some vests this may not be desirable, it adds a crisp finish to more tailored pieces. You can make topstitch with your sewing machine. \n For a subtle topstitch, use a regular or lightweight thread that is a similar shade as the fabric. For more contrast, choose a heavier thread and/or a contrasting color. \n Press the vest before adding topstitch for better accuracy., If you want the option of closing your vest, you'll need to decide how. Buttons and snaps are popular options and easy to add. \n Measure where you want your closures to go. You can eyeball the top and bottom closures and then measure and mark precisely where the middle closures should be. Ensure you have the positions marked evenly on both inside edges so that they line up. \n Follow the directions for your particular snap plier. First affix the stub to one side, and next the socket to the other. \n \n To make button holes by hand, sew two parallel satin stitches the length of the button and connect them at the top and bottom (these are called bar tacks). Place pins at either end of the hole, just along the bar tacks, and slice open the fabric in between the seams using a seam ripper or small, sharp scissors. \n Alternatively, your sewing machine might have an attachment for button holes. Lucky you!Sew buttons onto the opposite side of the button holes. \n 
 Make two columns with a list in each column. In column one write your interests and abilities (What are you good at?) In column two make a list of your difficulties and weaknesses. This can help to clarify your thinking in both areas by comparison and contrast. Hopefully you'll feel good about your strengths and prospects and you will not be confused.\n Define your questions. Ask questions of your teachers, mother, father and other elders, as well as your peers. Read and do research to seek answers at the local library or on the internet. \n If you are not sure about what you want to learn and develop, then just take a guess and start on something that seems right. \n \n You may need to get over some bad habits/weaknesses, and so work on lessening your weaknesses that seem to matter the most. For example, If you are good in improving your attitudes, being positive and thoughtful, then consider working in an area requiring contact skills in work that requires communicating with people. \n Persistence is about half of being successful. That takes mental discipline and keeping on doing positive habit-forming while breaking bad habits. This could be in school, in a career, a hobby or all of the above. \n Keep working and studying. Working itself is far more satisfying and important than reaching a temporary solution. Few things in life are permanent. \n Don't worry if your concepts are not clear at first or seem to come and go. Just step up and take a breath, keep going and be sure that you are doing it in a good manner. \n Be thankful for your opportunities and go for it, instead of complaining! If you find that your skills limit your earning potential consider staying in or going back to school or college. If your interest lies in the computer industry, many community colleges offer computer certification tests. Check with counselors at school or college. \n After all many employers just want to see that you can finish your program of study and be self-motivated to improve yourself, not just because of "the paper" for graduating from school and college. \n

For instance, the following command creates a variable\n With the above command, computer will reserve some memory and allow you to store to or retrieve from that memory with the name you chose, age. Remember at this point our variable age is null or has a garbage value–whatever computer's memory slot happens to hold. \n Examples of reserved words in JavaScript include var, or document.write. Basically, reserved words have a specific purpose in JavaScript, they cannot be used as a variable name. \n age, year, _month are all valid variable names. However, 11month, 9_ are not valid variable names. \n If your variable consists of more than one word, separate each word with an underscore (i.e., first_name, last_name) or use camel case (i.e., firstName, lastName). \n In JavaScript, a variable named first_name is considered different from first_Name or FIRST_name. \n Avoid using a variable name such as k, l, m, z, or a because you may have hard time figuring out what each variable represent in the future or in a long program. \n In JavaScript, however, you can also declare variables implicitly by using the assignment operator to assign a value to the new variable.

 Alimony is intended to mitigate any unfair effect of divorce on the lower-earning spouse. The theory underpinning spousal support is that the lower-earning spouse may have postponed or foregone a career in order to support the family.Alimony therefore attempts to compensate the spouse for this sacrifice. \n Alimony is also intended to help a spouse maintain a standard of living he or she became accustomed to during marriage.Alimony is not a reward for surviving a difficult marriage or a means to punish a spouse for bad behavior (such as an affair).Alimony is also not child support. The rationale behind child support is that a parent is financially responsible for his or her children even if the children do not live with that parent. Admittedly, an ex-spouse may financially benefit from child support if the children live with him or her. But the purpose is to allow your children to share in the lifestyle of the non-custodial parent, and child support amounts will be calculated with that end in mind. \n Alimony, by contrast, will be calculated to compensate the spouse for foregoing a career, to rehabilitate her to support herself going forward, and/or to facilitate the maintenance of a certain lifestyle.\n There are many different types of alimony that differ in purpose and duration. Common types of alimony include: \n Temporary support. A spouse may receive temporary alimony during a divorce, annulment, or legal separation.The ordered alimony is often calculated according to local rules and is less complex than a final order of alimony. It is only in force during the legal separation process and will be superseded by a final order of alimony. \n Transitional alimony. This type of support is mainly short term and applies when the recipient has the capacity to become self-sufficient but requires support while making the adjustment to the economic conditions outside of the marriage. This may include time necessary to obtain educational training.Other states consider support to help obtain an education as “rehabilitative support.” \n Compensatory alimony. Though less common, this type of support includes situations where one party made significant contributions to the other party’s overall earning potential.Compensatory spousal support may also be awarded when the dissolution of the marriage leads to one party receiving much more in value without any other property available to offset it for the other party.It is sometimes called “reimbursement” alimony.Long-term maintenance. Here, the court usually examines whether the recipient would be unable to reasonably maintain the long-term standard of living established in the marriage on his or her own. If transitional or rehabilitative support alone would not give the recipient the capacity to do so, maintenance support may be awarded.#*This form of support often receives different names in different states. In Tennessee, for example, this type is called alimony in futuro. It is called maintenance support in Oregon.Many states also allow the judge to award more than one type of support at the dissolution of a single marriage. This can lead to the recipient receiving more in the initial months or years after the divorce, and less or none in the long term. \n Alimony will be determined differently according to each state’s laws. Sometimes, states have a statute that lays out a formula used to determine alimony. More typically, state statutes will list factors that a judge will consider when calculating alimony. These factors include: The length of the marriage \n The income of each spouse (and future earning potential) \n The age and health of each spouse \n The standard of living during the marriage \n Whether one spouse made significant contributions to the education or career of the other during the marriage \n Whether one spouse’s career was affected by raising children \n The assets and debts of each party following the divorce \n Domestic violenceThe tax impact of alimony, Because the laws regarding alimony vary widely between states, it’s important to consult with a family law attorney in your area. The attorney should be familiar with the laws and common judicial decisions made in your state. \n With this experience, your attorney may be better able to predict how factors unique to your marriage will affect the amount of the alimony award. \n You can find attorneys by contacting your state bar association or by asking for recommendations from friends and relatives. \n Make sure to ask any potential candidate for their experience in alimony cases. You can also ask for references. Your attorney will have to ask other clients whether they would be willing to speak with you before giving you any information, however. \n Many states will certify family law specialists. You can look for this certification on the attorney’s website. Alternately, you can seek specialists through your state bar association’s referral list. To become certified, attorneys must have practice family law for many years, pass a written exam, and be recommended by peers or judges. \n Generally speaking, the longer the marriage, the more likely a spouse is to be awarded spousal support. Short-term marriages may not lead to support payments, regardless of other factors.The length of your marriage is important to determining alimony, but the criteria used vary by state. In some states, a marriage legally begins when the marriage certificate is filed with the state and ends when a petition for dissolution is filed. In others, the length of the marriage is measured through the date of physical separation, which could be before or after the official dissolution. \n Many states will also consider a lengthy period of cohabitation that preceded a marriage in the alimony calculation. For example, if a couple lived together before getting married, the court would likely include this period of time in its calculation. \n As a general rule, the likelihood of court-ordered alimony increases when the length of the marriage exceeds ten years. In some states, as in California, a judge may not set an end date for alimony if the couple has been married over 10 years.A significant amount of alimony is less likely to be awarded for marriages lasting less than ten years. To determine the legal length of your marriage, give your attorney the following information:The dates that you and your spouse lived together as a couple \n The date you married \n The date you divorced \n The date you stopped living together \n In addition to the length of the marriage, the court will also consider the ability of each spouse to independently support himself or herself when determining alimony.The greater the disparity between incomes, the larger the alimony payments could be. \n The court may also evaluate the potential income of each spouse. For example, if one spouse has a unique skillset or professional training but is not employed, the court would likely consider the potential income of this spouse rather than actual earnings. \n Similarly, if one spouse began a higher-paying job immediately after the divorce, the court may decide to base its alimony award on the higher income. \n How the court chooses to treat an income disparity in the alimony calculation will depend heavily on the precedents set by your state court system. \n Your attorney will want to know the age of each spouse, as well as the state of their health. Age is a particularly important factor when one spouse did not work during the marriage. Compile a list of any health issues or medical expenses that should be included in consideration of alimony.Alimony awards tend to increase with the age of each spouse. This is because older individuals typically have fewer opportunities to re-train or develop new job skills. Younger individuals are more likely to attend a degree program or train for a new career, thus providing a higher income in the future. Younger workers also have a longer time horizon to earn an income.Spouses who have poor employment prospects because of health, disability, or age are more likely to be awarded long-term or permanent alimony.The court will also consider the number of years remaining before an individual is expected to retire. Younger individuals have a longer time period to plan and save for retirement than older individuals, and thus, alimony awards tend to increase with the age of each spouse. \n The amount of alimony awarded should allow each spouse to maintain the same quality of life as under the marital standard of living.Many different expenses are considered part of the marital standard of living, including housing costs, as well as costs for clothing, food, insurance, child care, and other expenses. The amount of alimony awarded should allow each spouse to maintain the same quality of life as under the marital standard of living. \n This consideration often, but not always, applies to female spouses. For example, if one spouse stayed home with children while the other worked, this allowed the other spouse to invest in his/her career and increase his/her earning power. Such a condition might be taken into consideration in an alimony decision.Alternately, a situation could have arisen where one spouse worked while the other spouse increased his/her education level. The working spouse allowed the other to increase his/her earning potential, perhaps at the working spouse’s expense, and this might be factored into an alimony decision. \n The court will consider the financial situation of each spouse after the divorce is finalized, but before any alimony is awarded. Factor in the net worth of each spouse when trying to anticipate the amount of alimony that may be determined.A significant earning disparity is likely to lead to maintenance support, or spousal support that helps to maintain the standard of living established during the marriage.If the court feels that each spouse is capable of being self-supporting, then alimony payments are less likely to be awarded. \n At current, twenty-nine states factor fault into the calculation of spousal support.While many divorces simply state irreconcilable differences, others do assign responsibility for dissolving the marriage to one (or both) spouses. \n If “marital misconduct” (such as adultery) was cited as a factor in the divorce, the spouse guilty of this misconduct is less likely to be awarded support.Fault works in the opposite direction as well. If the supporting party has a documented history of physical or emotional violence against the recipient, then the supported party is likely to receive a judgment for a larger alimony settlement., To get alimony, you first need to separate from your spouse. You may begin to receive temporary alimony provided there is some physical separation, either because you are going through a divorce, have a restraining order, or for some other reason., You have the option of negotiating with your spouse for alimony. Negotiating a spousal partner agreement may provide more flexibly than you could get from a court order. You should look at the factors that a judge will consider in your state, since alimony agreements must nevertheless be approved by a judge.Negotiated alimony agreements are also part of collaborative divorce. In collaborative divorce, the parties commit to resolving disputes outside the court system through negotiation and mediation. The parties meet with their attorneys, a financial advisor, and possibly a mental health professional (if needed).If you are interested in collaborative divorce, you should seek a collaborative family law attorney. When meeting with attorneys, ask if they practice collaborative family law. \n Before seeking alimony, you should meet with a tax professional to discuss the tax implications of receiving alimony. If you receive alimony, it will count as general income.However, the paying spouse will not withhold taxes, so you will need to plan to make tax payments.The spouse paying maintenance typically can deduct payments on a federal tax return, however there are complicated hurdles you must clear before being able to claim the deduction.You should certainly meet with an accountant or tax professional. \n You should read IRS publication 504 for more information on what you must do to assure that your alimony payments are tax deductible.Whether or not payments are deductible on your state taxes will be determined by state law, which varies., If you’ve been awarded alimony, be sure to obtain a court order for spousal support. If you don’t, you’ll have no legal recourse should your ex-spouse stop making payments.This is another reason working with an attorney is important--you’ll need one to file your spousal support agreement and get a court order from the judge. \n If it is allowed in your state, ask the court to issue an order to your ex’s employer to deduct alimony payments from his or her paycheck. The employer will send that money to the court, which will then send you a check in that amount.Arranging for automatic payments eliminates the uncertainty of whether or when your ex will make payments. \n In some states, such as California, this is called a "wage assignment" and it occurs in every child support or alimony case unless you and your ex request otherwise.In many states, this is also known as "wage garnishment." The process of garnishing your ex's wages varies, but in many cases, you need only contact your court or the sheriff's office., In some cases, your ex may temporarily stop making payments due to uncontrollable circumstances, such as losing a job or a medical emergency. If you want to, you can negotiate an agreement with your ex to reduce or suspend the alimony payments until a future date.If you do not come to an agreement, your ex is still responsible to pay the full amount of support unless s/he seeks temporary relief from the court.In some states, if your ex stops paying alimony, you can ask the court to hold your ex in contempt (or issue an “earnings assignment order” to garnish wages).This may provide incentives for your ex to pay what is owed, such as threatening the possibility of jail time. \n If your ex is significantly delinquent with his/her alimony, you may be able to place a lien on your ex’s assets. A lien is an assertion of your legal right to property if a person owes you money. Property with a lien notice cannot be sold or refinanced by its owner until the lien is lifted.A lien remains in force until the owner of the property fulfills his/her obligation to the lien holder. \n If your ex fails to make alimony payments, you can request permission from the court to take the asset as payment, or force your ex to sell the property and pay what you are owed with the proceeds.A “Qualified Domestic Relations Order” (QRDO) may also be issued. This order will entitle you to part of your ex-spouse’s retirement plans, such as 401Ks, 403Bs, and other ERISA plans (not IRAs). In many cases, unpaid alimony can be taken from your ex’s retirement account., If nothing else has worked, you can file a lawsuit against your ex in small claims court (if the amount owed is beneath a state-determined limit) or in higher court (if the amount exceeds the small claims limit). \n This is an unusual procedure, and should be a means of last resort., If the alimony is not for a finite amount of time, it could be paid indefinitely. However, alimony payments will cease when:You reach the date set by the judge for cessation of alimony payments \n The spouse receiving alimony remarries or enters into a domestic partnership \n Your children no longer need a full-time parent at home \n A judge decides that the partner receiving alimony has not made a sufficient effort to become at least partially self-supporting \n A significant life event (e.g., retirement) occurs and the judge decides to modify alimony payments \n One party dies \n

 You will need different sizes of strong moving boxes to pack items of different sizes. Make sure you purchase good quality packing materials and strong moving boxes or cartons; it may be wise to consult a professional for recommendations. Also, consider acquiring: \n Padding supplies \n Bubble wraps \n Wrapping sheets \n Newspapers, blank newsprint paper \n Scissors \n Heavy duty packaging tape \n Labeling stickers \n Marking pens\n Include in it your moving truck reservation, moving helper payment codes (if applicable), pet veterinarian records (again, if applicable), cash for movers tips, your hotel reservation, contact information for important people (realtor or property owner), and any important documents you could need before you have the chance to unpack. \n Keep this file in a safe place, such as in your purse or personal bag, where you will not accidentally pack it in a box. It should also be in a place where it won't get buried in a mess that may develop. \n Include a personal-sized bar of soap, new toothbrush and toothpaste, towel and washcloth, disposable razor if needed, some "relaxing" clothes (sweats or something similar) and two complete changes of clothes, and anything else you know each person will need during the first few days (while everything else is in boxes). This way everything they'll need is easily attainable. \n Keep these boxes or suitcases in a safe place where they will not be mixed in with everything else, perhaps in the car or even farther away (work or a neighbor's house). Bring them with you in the car or however you are traveling. \n Instead of buying feet and feet of bubble wrap or handfuls and handfuls of packing peanuts, turn to your clothes to provide that padding. Not only does it save you money, but you have to pack the clothes anyway, so it’s really two birds with one stone. Clothes are often more malleable than paper and bubble wrap, anyway. \n As for things like glassware, wrap each one in a sock. It’s almost like that’s what the socks were truly meant for. If they clink against each other, they'll be fine. \n Is there anything you have set up that took you forever to get just right and you’re totally loathing the moment you have to disassemble it? Then snap a photo of it for quick reference later. \n You may also want to snap a photo for frame arrangements and decorative set-ups, too. Not to mention the nostalgia and memories, of course. \n You’ll want a nice, wide open space where you can drag and drop all your stuff and then expedite the packing process. This is where you’ll have your boxes, your packing materials, and your pens, tape, and labels. This is your I’m-getting-stuff-done room. \n As you pack each box and seal it up, put a number on it, in addition to the room label and contents. This way, if you have X number of boxes, you’ll know when one is missing, in addition to being able to tell the movers just how many boxes you have. \n Wrap each individual item properly with enough layers of wrapping sheets, bubble wrap, or clothes. Place items inside a box with extreme care in the best position possible to avoid damages. Heavier items should be placed on the bottom and lighter items should be placed on the top inside the boxes. Get as many items as possible in each box to cut down on the number of boxes you’ll need. \n Pack heavy items such as books, toys, etc. in small boxes. However, be conscious of not over packing boxes until they are bulky and may break. \n Pack fragile or breakable items with extra care and attention. If required, use more layers of wrapping sheets or bubble wraps to wrap such items. Place saran wrap between bottles and caps to prevent leaking. Consider putting cotton between fragile cosmetics, too. \n Use wadded newspapers or crushed papers to fill empty spaces of boxes or cartons. \n This makes unpacking easier once you get where you are going. Start packing one room at a time, packing smaller items first to get them out of the way. Carefully mark and tape each box so you can find everything when you unpack. \n This makes it easier for the movers, too. If they're courteous and not on a time crunch, they'll likely take each labeled box and put it in its corresponding room. \n Place all hardware in double-thick Ziploc bags, according to contents and room. Keep all bags in one box with the proper tools – allen wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, etc. This will make it easier to put everything back together when you have moved in. \n Make sure you keep the box of hardware and tools in a central place where everyone can find it. This will make re-assembling much easier. Place in it the small things like video ear plugs, remote controls, boxes of nails and things you will need immediately after moving in. \n Toss away junk and only box things that you use. Use your kitchen food storage containers for all loose things you find as you empty drawers from the kitchen, desks, or table drawers throughout the house. Label boxes according to contents and rooms they belong in then securely close or tape them. Use various sized bags for the same purpose. Add a sticky note inside each bag noting the contents like "stereo cables" and "pens and pencils.” Place all containers and bags inside a larger box labeled appropriately with room and content. \n Plates should be stacked vertically, like records. Don’t forget to look in the dishwasher! \n Do you need anything to stay intact, like necklaces (so they don't get tangled)? Try saran wrap or stretch wrap over them as is and then pack them. \n This most probably will include the items which you have been using until the date of the move. Think about small handy items you might want access to before you unpack all boxes. It may also be useful to add items such as dish soap, a sponge, a roll of paper towels, Kleenex, a couple pens, scissors, plastic/paper plates/forks, a bottle opener, bath towels for each family member, one pot, one pan, one plastic stirring utensil, an extra box cutter, etc. \n Keep in mind that people will need to wash their hands, eat, and shower long before you are done unpacking on the other end of the move. Having this box will make that simple. \n Also, toss in a sugary treat such as Lifesavers or hard candies in case anyone gets hungry or low blood sugar on move-in day. This is a good way to keep the bad moods at bay. \n Try to keep them stacked in the rooms that you have finished packing. Keep all power strips and extension cords and grounded adapters in one specific box; they will be much easier to find later. \n Clearly label the hardware box and the extension cord box. Consider spray-painting both boxes bright yellow or red. \n Place all the screws or bolts back into an item after it has been taken apart. This way, you can connect the bed or put the lampshade back on immediately instead of searching for them. \n Do you know where each one is? Are any in need of any extra tape job? Do you have more than you thought you might and need to inform the movers that you'll need a bigger truck? \n Which ones are fragile and which ones are sturdy? Are there any that you want to handle yourself, just in case? You may wish to set a few aside so you know where they're at at all times. \n Place any last minute items together in one room. Remember: when the truck has been filled, and the movers tell you that they have everything, checking out each room to make sure that nothing has been left behind is your responsibility. When you are certain that each room is clean, then it is time to shut the door and leave! \n Pro movers specialize in getting everything safely and efficiently from one house to the other. The do not specialize in separating your good china from the bad, not rounding up all of the dirty laundry on the floor. They will ask you to be cleaned and organized before they arrive. Good ideas include\n Grouping similar small items in boxes (books, dishes, etc.) \n Clearly designating valuable and fragile goods \n Throwing out and purging excess stuff in advance. \n Labeling boxes with final locations., Good movers are methodical. They keep everything in similar places, packing you up room by room. While they may mix things up to make sure everything fits well, they are practiced in the most convenient way to get things in and out of their truck. Expect them to work much more efficiently than you might on your own. \n One of the chief benefits of a moving team is that they know how to handle the bunk beds stuck in the kids' room. Professionals will take down the furniture into the most convenient, easily transported parts, pad the pieces safely, and put everything back together when you arrive. \n Since most movers are paid hourly, feel free to assemble or break down furniture by yourself if you feel confident in your abilities. You'll save some money., Things break when they are allowed to move around in the truck, bouncing off other objects. A good mover understands that packing tightly isn't just about saving space, it is about a snug, tight fit. They will: \n Use packing peanuts to fill empty space. \n Wrap furniture and large pieces in heavy blankets to prevent sliding or moving. \n Group square and rectangular objects, which can be jammed close together, in the same box., A professional makes their living off of transporting your things and has the wherewithal and knowledge needed to prevent accidents. That said, in the case that something does happen, professional movers have the responsibility to pay you back for any damages incurred. \n Hiring a professional insures the past possible pack job, and then insures you further if something bad happens. \n Always ask about the contract before signing-- some smaller companies may try to get out of responsibility for damages if you aren't careful. You may need to pay for warranty. \n A professional mover should keep a log of every box and item, allowing them to prove that they got everything safely to your new location. This sort of double-checking is crucial, especially on big or complicated (multi-truck, cross-country, etc.) moves. \n If the moving company does not inventory your items, you should. \n This can vary, but it is a good baseline when thinking about rates and how many movers you need. It takes two movers roughly 5 hours to completely pack a 1,000sq foot house (500ft per mover). Thus: \n With 4 movers, a 3,000ft house would like 13 hours. \n With 3 movers, a 2,000ft house would take 10-12 hours. \n With 6 movers, a 4,000ft+ house would take 15 hours or more., Maybe you want to save money and just have someone help with the heavy lifting. You can pre-pack the boxes. Maybe you want someone to do everything for you with a bit of guidance. You can pay for the movers to wrap and protect all your goods. Professionals are there to serve you, and will do the work that you need to be done. Expect a professional mover to ask a lot of questions about your exact needs.Movers will appreciate your direction and guidance as long as it saves things from breaking or getting lost. \n 
 Toads love cool and damp places like that. Toads are like tan colored frogs, but they have bumpy skin. The large brown wart behind each eye tastes bad if bitten, so that makes animals not want to eat toads. Toads eat small insects, like mosquitoes, and come out at night. Toads will try to scare you if you pick them up, they will pee on you! \n Now look for a horizontal web with a funnel in one corner. Funnel spiders in the US are not dangerous. Funnel spiders in Australia are! This is where the female spider hides during the day. She comes out in the evening when the light is dim and eats insects that fall in the web. Male funnel web spiders do not spin webs and wander around your yard eating things like mosquitoes. Funnel spiders look somewhat fuzzy, are light tan, with darker stripes on the back. \n Look for a circular web shaped like a bulls eye. Orb weaver spiders make these webs. At sunrise the webs collect dew and are easily seen. \n Caterpillars are baby butterflies or moths. They eat plants. What color is it? Some caterpillars get quite large, up to 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) long, like tomato hornworms. If you have tomato plants in your yard, you will probably have tomato hornworm caterpillars. Hornworms have a little horn on their rear end. \n Look for a little pile of droppings in the evening. Now look to the leaf right above the droppings, under the leaf. Is he there? \n Ant lions are also called "doodle bugs". The ant lion waits for an ant to fall into the funnel, then he throws sand at the ant to make it fall down to the base. When the ant gets to the bottom, the ant lion drags him under the sand. Don't worry, there are plenty of ants left. \n In general, moths have feathery antennas, and butterflies have thin, smooth antennas. Butterflies love: purple coneflowers, butterfly weed, butterfly bush, and other flowers that have lots of nectar. Do not touch the butterfly, you are a giant to them and you could easily damage their wings. \n Bees also like the nectar from the same flowers as butterflies. There are many kinds of bees, including honey bees, larger bumblebees, and even larger carpenter bees. Honey bees are just a little fuzzy with a yellow/gold abdomen. Bumble bees are very fuzzy with black and yellow. Honey bees gather pollen on their legs and use it to make honey in their hive. \n You will often find them together. Do not touch the wasps, they can sting if they get scared. Wasps come in many colors too. The yellow-jackets are yellow and black. Steel blue cricket killers are an iridescent black/blue. The cuckoo wasp is a metallic green. Wasps in the US range from very tiny 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), to 4 inch (10.2 cm) long cicada killers (they do sting), to 6 inch (15.2 cm) long megarhyssa. The megarhyssa has a 3" body, 3" egg tube, but no stinger. \n There are several bugs you might find here. \n You can pick one up. It might crawl on you and tickle you, or it might roll into a ball. Gently poke it to make it roll into a ball. After a minute (be real still) it will unroll and wander around in your hand. Pill bugs eat dead wood or dead leaves. \n They are safe to pick up, but are messy. They have 2-4 antennas which are their eyes. They leave a slime trail wherever they go. They need a damp place to live. \n They eat dead leaves also. \n The common centipede is a golden color, flat, and has many legs that stick way out from its side. \n They look like a tube with legs going straight up and down. They are not flat. You can catch them, but they will probably freeze. If you hold real still and do not breathe on them they might start moving again. \n There are many sizes of ants, from the tiny brown sugar ants, commonly found between your sidewalk cracks (which also appear in your kitchen looking for sugary foods), to larger carpenter ants which eat wood. \n They eat other bugs and are called "shield bugs". \n Japanese beetles are smaller beetles and have iridescent, metallic green and yellow colors. June beetles are a dark brown. They do not bite, and are slow moving. They can fly and they might try to fly away if you pick them up! \n You should get a heavy duty minnow net with a 5 foot (1.5 m) handle so your teacher can scrape the bottom of the pond or stream.\n Make good contact with the bottom the whole time then quickly bring up the net so nothing swims out of it. \n Crayfish can really hurt if they pinch you, you must be specially trained to pick up an adult crayfish. If the crayfish is under an inch it should not be able to pinch you. Crayfish eat dead and dying plants and animals on the bottom of the stream. Crayfish have many names like: crawfish, clawfish, mudbug, and others. \n They eat things that are smaller than themselves. There are too many types of minnows to name. but if the adult is less then 4 inches (10.2 cm) long, it's probably a minnow. In the spring they swarm by the hundreds or thousands in the same place to lay eggs. \n They look like skinny sticks with legs. Some have a breathing tube as their tail, which they poke above the water to breathe. If you catch one in a net it is safe to pick them up GENTLY by the breathing tube. Don't get near their mouth, they will bite if scared! They eat anything that swims by. \n Toad tadpoles, or "toadpoles", are solid black and the smallest of the bunch. Frog tadpoles are always shades of green and tan. Bullfrog tadpoles can take up to 2 years to turn into a frog, and they are the biggest of them all! The head and tail can measure 3 inches (7.6 cm)! \n Pick it up by the sides so it doesn't bite you. It is also called a "toe biter" because sometimes swimmers step on them, they get scared, and bite the person on the toe. The bite is not dangerous but it sure hurts! Giant water bugs can fly. They come out at night and can be found below porch lamps there were turned on at night. They can also be found after they land in a pool, or land on a car windshield because it looks like water. In some countries, like India, the giant water bug is called a "water scorpion". \n Mosquito larva are worm-shaped, but have to breathe air. If they feel someone walking buy, or see a moving shadow, they will wiggle themselves in an "S" shape to the bottom of the pool. Wigglers can be found in almost any standing water. Adult midges look just like mosquitoes but midges do not bite. Larva get to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) long at most. Mosquito larva that look like a comma will hatch into adults within 24 hours. \n They are called "glass" shrimp because they are clear. Their stomach is at the top of their back, behind their eyes, and you can see what he ate. They are also called "ghost shrimp". \n They are also called "tadpole shrimp". They have short life spans, about 6-8 weeks. They look like tiny 1–2 inch (2.5–5.1 cm) long horseshoe crabs. Their eggs survive drying, so they are sold in hobby stores. The triops got its name because it has 3 eyes, although you can see only 2. The shape of its eyes make it look mad, but it is safe to pick up. It may flop around in your hand and tickle you. \n 
 This is a list that usually consists of the following: each player's name, age or date of birth, uniform size, if they have played on a team before, preferred position, name and phone numbers of parents/guardians (if they are younger than 18).\n You may need to ask your league's soccer commissioner for this information, check the league's website, or contact another coach responsible for the same age group as you. This information is crucial when planning the difficulty and frequency of practices. \n Some leagues do this for you. Contact other coaches who coach at the same level and age group as you to ask how often their teams practice if you're unsure. \n At some point you should be able to decide this based on your own understanding of the mechanics of your players and when they need practice versus when they need breaks. \n Try to maintain at least two soccer practices per week. High level teams with older players sometimes increase this to four or even five practices. It is your decision how often and long you should hold practices. It is important to manage this with when the soccer fields are free. \n You may have to contact the league commissioner for this, however all leagues are different. Sometimes you have to contact a county run office, for example the county recreation department office. Generally a league commissioner will have notified you how to do this when you signed up for coaching for their league. \n Having some form of online presence is greatly encouraged as it gives players a way to contact each other if other methods fail. Post upcoming games, practices, as well as the entire soccer schedule and be sure to add reminders for their upcoming games. \n Most coaches find that the best way to notify players is through group email. That said, some coaches find that calling each player works best. \n For older players this is probably pretty self-explanatory, however new players need to understand what to bring and wear. \n They need to be equipped with cleats, long socks over shinguards, and bottled water. It is up to you to decide if they need anything else after preparing a full practice plan. \n You can post this information on the internet, and/or explain it in the email, text, or phone call. \n This also depends on the practice you choose to drill, however there are some basic things every coach tends to bring. \n Remember to bring soccer balls, cones, several full water bottles, coloured bibs, clipboard with practice plan as well as roster, paper, pencil/pen and any handouts you choose to give players or parents. \n Sometimes a drill may require a 'ladder', a flat ladder-shaped agility obstacle. If you choose to bring this, try to keep it untangled. \n In addition, mini soccer goals are occasionally provided by coaches when training on a field without them. If you decide to purchase some, look for some that wrap and compress easily. \n For first time soccer practices, it can be important to prepare a handout with league rules for games and general behavior. Also include your own rules for practice, your phone numbers, telephone number of your supervisor and the number to call to see if games have been cancelled. Also consider adding information about contacting you to get more involved both as players and parents. \n Encouraging activities such as carpooling, after-game dinners, and possibly even snacks (for younger age groups) will both encourage players to get more involved as well as bring your team closer together. The closer your team is, the more likely you are to see good teamwork on the field. \n It is important to have a clear understanding of your teams weaknesses and faults before planning a large practice. Many leagues have a tryout date at which you can observe and take notes on players' abilities. If not, consider having your next practice be purely for evaluation purposes and have them do some very clean cut and stark drills (i.e. running sprints, long distance, and basic drills). \n Depending on how you coach and their ages, you may not need to assign specific positions. At an early age, a player should be more focused on developing their skill everywhere rather than one specific position. \n That said, with older teams it is important to pick out one or two goalkeepers. These players need to be dedicated and hard working. Some coaches choose to bring in specialists or assistant coaches to coach them separately, but bring them back in occasionally for scrimmages and exercises to keep the flow of teamwork. \n Keep players hydrated, it's important to keep them playing at their best. \n This is usually a pulse raiser, or a drill specifically designed to gradually increase body temperature and blood flow to the muscles. This can be as simple as running laps, or you could include a small circuit of exercises. Try to limit this to a simple 5-10 minutes. \n For youth teams, fun activities such as stuck in the mud are good. \n This stretches out joints and can make exercise more comfortable. Stretches such as lunges, side steps, high kicks and windmill arms are great for this. That said, your pre-practice stretches shouldn't consume too much time. \n This gets the body back into soccer mode and your muscles get to remember how to perform the basics again. Make the players do some exercises such as these: \n Short and long passing in pairs or small groups. \n Quick shooting practice. \n Again, for youth teams this could be made into a game. For example, seeing which pair can make the most passes or hit the target the most in a certain time period. \n This should raise the players' heart rate to 60-80% of their maximum heart rate. This helps to develop their cardiovascular endurance. Fitness needs to be constantly maintained so that players are at match fitness throughout the season. \n Fartlek training is possibly the best training method for soccer. The mixture of intensities and terrain simulates match situations. \n If you want to go through set pieces, new tactics or just maintain the team's skill level, this is the part of the session to do it in. \n This gives the players a chance to put any new skills or tactics they have learned into practice and helps develop muscle memory. If the players are tired and weary, let them rest before playing the game. Adding a game is optional. \n This gradually returns the body to its normal state and disperses excess lactic acid, reducing stiffness and muscle soreness. This is often consists of a light jog around the pitch, then slowing into a walk before sitting down with straight, stretched legs. \n This helps stretch out your joints and is good for relieving stress after a hard session. \n After practice is when everyone should be quiet, refueling, and listening to you. Lots of coaches use this time as an opportunity to review practice and remind players what to do outside practice. \n It's important to remind them to stretch, practice and stay active in general. Never ridicule specific players, but feel free to compliment any players you think did exceptionally well, or the ones who could use some encouragement. It's important to switch up the players you call out to avoid a teacher's pet situation. \n It's important to have some handouts ready for players and/or parents to let them know what happens next. Be sure to announce the next practice time and offer yourself to answer anybody's questions or concerns. \n This is simple coaching etiquette and simply shows you care. For lower age groups, it's also a safety matter. Wait for your players to either get home by themselves or have their parents take them home. \n Phone calls and SMS may be a little bit heavy handed for this, but it's good to let players know what they need to work on once again in an email and on your team's online presence. \n If you've got the time, shooting emails out to individual players is a good idea, too. Remember, however, anything you email a player can be shared with other players. The goal is to provide an open and positive community within your team. \n 
, If you use more than one piece to complete a corner, be sure that there is an overlap of 1 inch (2.54cm)., The top sheets of siding will slide under this piece., Slide the bottom of the siding into the footer, being sure to allow for expansion. You should be able to wiggle the siding slightly. Slide the ends under the corner posts in the same manner. \n Affix the siding to the wall by centering a nail in each section of the nail strip. Don't pound the nails in all the way. \n Be sure to overlap successive panels by 1 inch (2.54cm)., Use gutter-seal adhesive to finish the installation at window sills and eaves., Lock it into place at the top of the preceding panel, and slide it under the F-channel., Hang this panel by placing a nail at the top of each nail strip, at about 8 inch (20.32cm) increments., Moving from the center out, interlock each strip with the previous one, continuing to place the nails at 8 inch (20.32cm) increments., Shim the J-channel at about 5/16 inch (0.794cm) to keep the post on the same plane as the other strips. The edges will insert between the J-channel and the outer flange of the post., The primary difference between this application and the others, is that the vertical corner boards will be installed last., Add metal flashing to control water flow., Make sure that each plank is cut square to avoid any gaps. Be sure to prime the sheets of siding on both sides and at the edges. Also, be sure to prime any exposed ends when panels are trimmed., Install the successive pieces so that they are nailed through the bottom of the upper board, and into the beveled edge of the lower board. \n The uppermost board will be installed so that it abuts the eaves. Split the board so that the width is shortened, and then cover the exposed edge with frieze board. \n
 To get all craftable wings, you need to get Souls of Flight. Start by getting up to a Sky bridge or Floating Island.\n They look like long, serpentine dragons. Kill it to get Souls of Flight. The maximum number you'll need is 20. \n You can do this by either continuously slaying enemies in the Harmode Crimson/Corruption. Combine 20 Souls of Flight, 25 Souls of Night, and 10 feathers (dropped by Harpies) at a Mythril Anvil to get Demon wings. \n An alternative method to find Souls of Night is to kill the Eater of Worlds continuously. \n Kill all Illuminant enemies until you have 25 Souls of Light.

 If the pillow is inside a pillow protector (a zippered, padded pillowcase), take it out of that as well.\n Be sure to check along the seams. If there are any rips or tears, you will need to sew them back up. \n This will help things balanced inside the washer.If you are unable to fit the pillows in the drum, squeeze them first to get the air out.Try not to use a top-loading washer, as the agitator may damage the pillows. If you do not have a front-loading washer, consider visiting a Laundromat; they should have one available that you can use.If you must use a top-loading washing machine, put the pillows in vertically instead of horizontally. That way, they won't get tangled in the agitator., This will prevent any buildup or residue. Also, try to use liquid detergent instead of powder one. Powder detergent is more likely to cause buildup and residue.This can lead to skin irritations and allergies. Pillows are bulky, so they do not rinse out well. The less soap you use, the less you will have to rinse them. \n If you can, try to use hot water. This will help kill any dust mites that might be living inside your pillow.Keep in mind, however, that hot water may also damage the feathers. If you are worried about this, use warm or cool water instead., This will help get any soap residue out. The extra spin cycle will help get rid of any excess moisture. \n Place the pillow between two towels, and press down on it. The towels will help soak up any extra water. Repeat this step for the other pillow. Do not wring or twist the pillows., Use a delicate cycle, with either a low-heat or no-heat setting. Using low-heat will help the pillows dry faster, but it may damage the feathers inside. Using the no-heat or air-only cycle may take longer (and two to three cycles), but it will be the safest for the feathers.Be sure to fluff the pillow between cycles. Do this by taking it out of the dryer and beating it. This will also help break up any clumps inside the pillow. \n If you are using a low-heat setting, consider using the air-only setting towards the end of the cycle. This will help keep the pillows from overheating and getting ruined., If you do not have any dryer balls, you can use some clean tennis/canvas shoes instead; be sure to put them inside a clean pillowcase first, however. You can also stuff a tennis balls into a clean sock. This will help keep the pillow fluffy as it is drying.You can also add a thick towel into the dryer. This will help soak up any water that might be left in the pillow., Even with dryer balls, there may still be some clumps inside the pillow. Hold the pillow by two corners and shake it up and down for a few minutes. Repeat this step for the other side. \n Do not use your pillows if they are still damp. Doing so can lead to rot and mildew. \n Set the washing machine to a "soak" cycle. Add the hydrogen peroxide and white vinegar directly into the drum. Once the soak cycle has finished, add the detergent., Add it directly to your detergent.Baking soda may also help get rid of stains. \n White vinegar may also help get rid of smells. \n This will give the pillow a nice, subtle scent. Try something soothing, such as lavender, rosemary, or vanilla., These are padded pillowcases that you put over the pillow. You can then put a fabric pillowcase over these. Pillow protectors will help keep the pillow clean longer, and keep it from getting stained. \n The sunlight, heat, and fresh air will help kill any odor-causing bacteria. It may also make your pillow smell fresher. \n 
 By shopping around at several mortgage lenders, you can determine which ones offer the best interest rates.Finding the lowest rate can save you significant amounts of money over the term of the mortgage. \n You may be able to get a general sense of mortgage rates in your area by using online tools offered by real estate websites, banks, or other lenders.However, to get a specific quote, you will need to contact or visit lenders.\n If interest rates change, your rate will change. A rate lock, however, is a legally binding promise (qualified by any special terms) that you will get a specified rate from a lender. \n This means that a varying number of “points” are charged depending on the conditions of the rate lock. These points translate into different fees. For instance: \n In many cases, it is free to lock in a rate for up to 30 days (in some cases, up to 45 days). \n Typically, rate locks are guaranteed thereafter in 30-day increments, with higher fees for longer terms. A 90-day rate lock, for example, will cost more than a 60-day rate lock; a 120-day rate lock will cost more than a 90-day one. \n One point equals one percent of the loan amount., While locking in a mortgage rate can protect you against interest rate hikes, it can also prevent you from benefiting if interest rates fall.Some lenders, however, offer a mortgage rate lock float down, which allows you to make a one-time decision to exchange your locked-in rate for a lower one.Thus, it can be in your best interest to find a lender which offers this possibility. \n Some lenders require a clause in mortgage rate lock agreements that allows the quoted rate to rise by a certain limited amount if interest rates rise before you close on a house. This is known as a rate cap.Even with a rate cap, a mortgage rate lock agreement offers you some protection from rising interest rates. However, by shopping around for interest rates you will determine the best agreement terms, and find out if any lenders do not require a rate cap. \n There can be considerable pressure to do this as soon as possible. However, this isn’t always the best idea. \n In some cases, mortgage rates might fall. Talk to your realtor or another knowledgeable individual about current trends and expectations for rate activity. \n Some lenders charge a rate lock deposit, which you may or may not want to or be able to pay. \n Some lenders will lock in your mortgage rate at a slightly higher rate than the current rate. This allows you to continue to shop for a home while avoiding a rise in interest rates. However, if it turns out you did not need to lock in your rate, you will end up being charged more than was necessary. \n If you decide that you do not want to seek a mortgage rate lock from a lender, then the rate will “float.” This means that your rate will be set at whatever the prevailing rate is shortly before your scheduled closing date., Once you have decided on the best lender and/or interest rate, request to see a blank copy of the lender’s rate lock form, if possible. This will give you an exact sense of what to expect before submitting your own application. If you have time, you can have the blank form looked at by your realtor and/or real estate lawyer for approval.\n Rate lock fees can be several hundred dollars. In many cases, a rate lock fee might be refunded, unless your mortgage application is canceled. \n Depending upon the institution, you may have several ways to make the request (phone, fax, in-person visit, etc.). However you initially contact the institution, it is important to get the request in writing.Send a document that specifies the rate you would like to lock your mortgage in at, and any applicable points or other terms. Make sure that your request is signed and dated by you and any co-borrowers. \n Most lenders will connect you with a mortgage consultant or office to contact when you are ready to request your rate. \n Your realtor or real estate attorney can help you in preparing this request. \n When sending your request, make sure that you have completed any application and made any deposit your lender requires to get a mortgage. \n Your lender should send you a letter confirming your request for a rate lock within a specified period (usually a brief one, such as 5 days).If your request is approved, you should get a written confirmation from your lender. Make sure that the confirmation displays:The agreed-upon rate \n Whether or not the rate is guaranteed \n The property address \n The loan amount and program (i.e., the mortgage period) \n The lock in fee \n The lock in date \n The lock in expiration date \n Any special terms or conditions \n The lender’s and borrower’s signatures \n In certain situations, you can re-negotiate the rate lock terms; in others, you will either have to accept the new rate or seek a new mortgage. For example: \n If rates change in between making a lock in request and its approval, the original request will be void. You will then have to re-negotiate the request, if desired. \n If you change the kind of loan you are requesting, or the terms of the loan (for example, the amount of your down payment), your rate can change. \n Your rates can also change if your credit score rises or falls during or after the process of making the rate lock request. \n If your income cannot be verified, lenders may not be able to honor a rate guarantee. \n A change in the appraised value of the home you are seeking to buy can also result in a change to your rate. \n

This makes your Patapon attack in this case throw spears at the wall. You can practice your Pata Pata Pata Pon instead but they won’t move but you can build a fever up by getting 10 combo points. Anyway attack the wall by doing keep on doing it until you destroyed the way you can build up combos with this one too. Remember to do the next one only after the Patapons have finished singing. After you have destroyed the wall do your victory dance by keep on doing Pon Pon Pata Pon four more times in a row after that move on forward with Pata Pata Pata Pon. when you get near the totem pole you will notice that it has symbols but you can't do anything there at the moment so keep on going. if you see enemies like birds and other things don’t stop to close because less advantage for you. attack and try to kill them if you can, sometimes helps if you're in a fever (10 combo points). you do more damage in a fever. the birds you see do run away easily. \n You can get combos by doing Pata Pata Pata Pon, and then doing Pon Pon Pata Pon, it doesn’t have to be the same one each time. The more combo points you have the more damage you do. You can get coins from the sunflowers and enemies if they get destroyed while you’re attacking. Move over the coins to collect them. All the enemies on this level run away and don’t attack so don’t be afraid to attack them. Keep moving forward and attacking to get to the flag pillar and the end of the mission. Mission Complete! \n On the mission complete screen you will see the Patapons carrying on carts the beasts you killed back to their home. \n Another information screen will pop up. \n Talk to the Patapon with the cloak that is standing next to what looks like a shrine. Click on the shrine and this will take you to a screen with the items you have collected like how many spears you have and how much food you have from the beasts you have killed and lots more. Also how many coins you have is on the top right. Press to go back. Click on the big black pillar when you want to go to the world map and the next mission., You might want to build up a fever to do more damage. The 4 Zigotron behind the wall will move right behind the next wall what is next to another wall. A Patapon with a sword and shield will come out of the bush and join your group. Destroy the next wall will your group (your new Patapon is very strong). While destroying the walls watch out for enemy Zigotron. Just keep on moving right destroying the walls and the enemy and collecting the items as you go. Destroy the small black pillar then the small house. After that your new Patapon will die and turn into a butterfly. Pick the items it drops and go through the end of level flag. Mission Complete! \n When you select it, a menu opens up showing the Patapons you can make, how much you have all together, how much it cost to make a specific Patapon, and what items are need e.g. to make a spear Patapon you need meat, wood, and 80 coins. The circles show how many of each Patapon you already have., You need to press circle in time to make the tree shake and drop an item. If you fail you can try again but you need to give one piece of meat again. when you hear the person go for example Pon Pon Pon when he finishes you press circle, circle, circle and so on. Listen to what the person says, if it says four words you have to press the circle button four times but you have to do it in the same tempo as the singer. Once you done that you will get the items you need (wood). \n The sequence is: O/O/O O/O/O O/O/OO O/O/OO O/OO/OO O/OO/OO O/O/O O/O/OO \n If you get stuck just talk to the Patapon with a cape. \n You have to pass the tree mini-game so if you fail it and don’t have any meat you have to play a previous level to collect some meat. You will know that the level contains meat because it will have a meat symbol on the world map. So play the level with the meat symbol and get some meat by killing beasts and completing the level. In this game it’s good to play over the old levels and a lot of the time is required. \n Once you have passed and got a branch, make a spear Patapon, you will notice that it is all orange. Then make sure it’s on your team then play the second square on the world map. \n You will have to fight lots of Zigotron now, there not that hard if you have an axe Patapon because it will go up front and take all the damage while you’re attacking with your spear throwers behind. this is probably be the first time you get a proper fever going and maybe the first time a Patapon dies none did for me though. Keep on moving forward and attacking the enemy and trying to keep the combos going till you get to the end. Destroy the building and go through the flag. Mission complete! \n Remember to upgrade your Patapons with better weapons when you can. \n Destroy the first wall, then take out the tower, watch out for the archers on the tower and the other Zigotron patrolling below it once they're all dead and building destroyed a Patapon archer will appear. for the next bit do the same tactic as before and destroy the wall, tower, house and the next tower if you see a green potion pick it up, it restores your Patapons life. If you get fever going it won’t take long to kill them all. The archer you got fires fire arrows which can set the Zigotron a light this makes them run around and not fight back. After you they're all dead and buildings destroyed, move forward. Destroy the black pillar. When you get near the house the bow Patapon will die and turn into a butterfly pick up the items it drops, destroy the building and go through the flag. Mission complete! \n You can now make archers. \n This level might be hard if you’re not prepared because of the tough grim reaper type Zigotron you face, it keeps on attacking you with tornadoes which make your Patapons jump in the air and get hurt. In the middle is a Patapon trapped in a cage; you need to save him too so make sure you don’t kill him by accident. Keep on moving forward and attacking the enemy, having fever is very helpful and picking up green potions. Your probably won't are able to kill the boss here because it will probably run away from you. Mission complete! \n To defeat the boss coming up you will need a lot of Patapons so do the second square, the one with the meat icon a few times to build up a bigger squad and use the best equipment you have available. Also do the tree mini game if you need more wood. \n \n Go forward and destroy the pillar. You will get a new drum Chaka and a new sequence Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. Does the new sequence a few times, when ready keep moving forward. When the fire breathing dragon comes use Chaka Chaka Pata Pon each time, this makes you defend and attack. Only the Patapons with shields defend. If Patapons die make sure you pick up there helmets and just keep on attacking with Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. It isn’t that hard if you got the most Patapons you can get at the moment. I had 11 Patapons, 3 axes, 6 spears and 1 archer. \n If any Patapons died, make sure you reborn them when you get back to your village. You do this by going to the heart shaped tree. \n If you go past it, you will start burning and dying very quickly because of the extreme heat of the desert. You will need something to cool it down., I don’t know if it needs to be raining for it to work., Basically the same as the last boss fight but a bit harder. Keep on attacking with Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. Your Patapons might get eaten so watch out for that. Keep attacking if your entire shields Patapons die then attack using Pon Pon Pata Pon. Keep at it and it should die eventually. The boss dragon drops a rain item. \n \n New Sequence: = miracle \n Voice: Don DoDon DoDon \n Do the rain miracle at the start. You have to be in fever to do it. If you can’t do it, practice a lot. After that move forward to the tower. Destroy the tower then keep moving forward. You will see beasts that you can attack also one will have a blue symbol on it, if you attack that one it will turn into a snail. When you get tot he talking sign destroy the rock in front and get fever. Once the rock in front is destroyed use rain miracle then move forward and destroy the rocks and keep on moving forward. you need to try to keep fever going so you can use the rain miracle straight away or if you move forward really quickly and destroying the rocks as you go you can get out the desert with only doing the rain miracle once but you will lose a lot of Patapons this way so make sure you pick up the helmets they drop. Keep going forward destroy the building at the end and go through the flagpole. \n They will attack in groups and each group has two zigotrons on horses. This levels isn’t that hard if you use all the things you have learned so far like knowing when to attack and charge or when to hold your ground. When they are near most of the time its best to use the defend command. When they are not near use the attack command. Make sure you try to stay in fever for most of the time because this will help you do more damage. Make sure you pick up the green potions they drop. When you get near the end you will see zigotrons hiding in the bushes. Also near the end lots of them will attack if you are in fever and you use the attack command they will run away and retreat. So you don’t have to kill all of them near the end. Destroy the building then go through the flagpole., Do the rain miracle at the start. Move forward and you will see a blue beast, hit it and it will turn into a snail now all you have to do is kill the snail. Make sure you are in fever mode most of the time and keep on attacking. If it gets to far make sure you move forward with it and keep on attacking. When it dies it will drop a hat pick it up and go through the flagpole at the end., You will now have a new mini game. You can select the new mini game by pressing to get to it., When the game starts keep on pressing in time with the flashing sides or at a steady pace. While you do this the farmer will plant flowers, water flowers and do stuff with the big flower when this is done the big flower will talk to you. This is to allow you to get ready for the next bit. When your farmer is holding a leaf over its head, keep on pressing fast and if done right the farmer will catch a big cabbage. Well done you have completed the flower mini game., Make sure you have lots of Patapons with good equipment. This boss fight can be hard but if you have lots of Patapons it isn’t as hard, the boss does three attacks. A fire attack when it breaths in air. A head attack when it raises its head and a ground attack when it lies on the ground. When the boss is about to do an attack do the defend command then after that do the attack command. If you keep in fever most of the time and defend when it attacks and attack when it isn’t then you can beat it quite easy. When its eyes start to flash that means its going to die soon., horse squad for the archer squad etc., Also you need to watch out for the zigotron army who are out in force to stop you. They are quite easy to defeat if you make sure your Patapons are up to the job and you have quite a lot of them. Make sure to remember all the tactics you have learned and use them in battle., You will see a zigotron that looks like a grim reaper. You don’t have to kill it. All you need to do is kill all the zigotron that are hiding in the bushes. The easiest way is to get fever going and keep on attacking. A big zigotron will come and attack in the middle of the battle but is easy to kill. After there all dead the grim reaper zigotron will retreat so all is left to do is go through the flagpole. If you fail the first time try again and you’re more likely to complete it.
 \n At no point during your entire performance is your partner allowed to touch you. You can touch, lick, rub and caress him all you want but play it cool. A slow seduction is a sure recipe for lap dancing success. The whole point of a lap dance is to drive your partner crazy with anticipation and desire. \n You are in charge. Take your time, take control, and take pleasure in teasing them. \n If they reach out in your direction or starts to grind back, slap their wrist and let them know that if they do it again, the dance is over, no exceptions.\n You won’t look sexy if you don’t feel sexy. Accept and enjoy yourself regardless of your shape or size. Any woman can perform a great striptease or lap dance regardless of whether they’re shy or feel their body is not the "perfect shape". It’s all about attitude. Not all lap dancers have supermodel figures, they just behave like they do. This is your time to be seductive, to nurture and release your sensual spirit. Drop your inhibitions and throw caution to the wind. You are a sexy goddess. \n There’s a wide variety to choose from. From erotic dance-wear to bras, panties, garter-belts, stockings, chemises, robes, teddies, swimsuits, club-wear, fetish-wear, over-sized button-up shirts and so much more. The key is to build up a collection of layers that are easy to remove. Be daring, you’re performing a tease, so a bit of flesh is essential. \n Start by selecting underwear first as these items will be the last to come off. A sexy bra, g-string, stockings (stay-ups are easier to work with) and perhaps suspenders. \n Panties should frame your cheeks while the back of your panties should reach too high over your cheeks. Try full bottomed panties, thongs, g-strings and booty shorts to see which works best for you. Panties that leave lines on your body after you take them off are probably too tight and should be avoided. \n Thigh high stockings worn with or without garters are a sexy addition to almost any outfit. Try a pair that’s one size smaller for sexier movement. If you plan to keep your stockings and garter on for the duration of your dance, wear your panties on the outside of the straps so that they can be removed without having to unhook your garters. \n For the top layers, try little hot pants, an innocent sheer robe, sexy high-school teacher/student uniform, be a dominatrix, a desperate housewife or for something different, a classic red or black evening dress with some retro lingerie underneath. \n Avoid corsets or clothing that’s too tight and difficult to slip out of. Clothing with zips at the back or many straps that take time to put on will of course be difficult to remove. \n For shoes, high heels and stilettos usually work best with any outfit. They make your legs look toned, sleek, and longer. Even if they’re slightly uncomfortable, give them a try because you won’t be wearing them for long anyway. If you can’t walk in heels, rather wear something you’re comfortable in. If all else fails in the shoe department, go barefoot and try the Barefoot Strut. \n Remove as much as you are comfortable with. You may choose to end up totally nude, topless, in sexy lingerie, a lacy gown or remain fully clothed. Your lover however must remain fully clothed. \n If your choose shoes with buckles, consider how you’ll remove your clothing without taking off your shoes. Stretchy clothing or flowing dresses can be taken off over your shoes, but check first. If all else fails in the shoe department, the bare-foot stripper strut (on your tip toes) is also very hot. \n If you’re doing it in heels, don’t take them off (except to remove stockings - or better yet, keep your stockings on). Perhaps put the heels back on once the stockings are off. Strapless shoes can be removed more gracefully than shoes with straps or buckles. \n If you chose something that needs to be removed by slipping it over your head, seductively slip it off by pulling it from the bottom on the sides while standing up tall, don't hunch over. \n A shirt with buttons can be a very sexy item of clothing to remove. Play peek-a-boob with each side. When you’ve undone the last button, turn around posing at an angle, expose your one shoulder then the other and then let is slip down to the floor. \n Tight trousers or jeans can be difficult to remove. A pencil skirt can easily be unzipped and pushed down Do this while bending forward with your back or side to him and then step out of it. Skirts can be removed with your shoes and stockings on. \n Practice removing your stockings ahead of time. For extra balance (and teasing), place your toes between his legs or on the arm of his chair while you push each stocking down - or slowly roll or fold them down the length of your leg. \n Don’t forget to tease. For beginners, take your time with each layer. Pull your skirt up or your underwear down a few inches before removing. Tuck a thumb or two into the sides of your trousers, skirt or underwear, lower the item of clothing slightly and tease. \n Push your bra straps off your shoulders before turning away to unclasp. A classic stripper routine is to hold the bra against your breasts, turn around with your back towards your man and drop your bra on the floor or, when standing with your back to him, hold your bra by the straps above your head before dropping it onto the floor. Keep the heat up by keeping your arm and hand over your breasts then slowly turn around and slide your hand across and away from your breasts for a sexy reveal. \n When taking your bottoms off, try slipping them off over your shoes or bare feet while standing straight-legged. Do this by bending over from the waist and guiding them off all the way to the floor and then stepping out of them. If this isn't easy for you, try bending your knees or taking your bottoms off while lying on your back. Don’t squat down too low… \n Don’t get completely naked until the very end — and even then, tease him with a back view until he can’t take it anymore. \n Think smooth and seductive. Avoid songs with high pitched vocals. The crooners and divas of the 60s are a good place to start if you want something romantic. A sensual rhythm or beat will guide you through your dance. It's best if you can relate to the music and feel comfortable moving to its beat. Start by setting aside 2 or 3 songs. \n Song one is for the warm-up. This is your time to lead your partner to the chair, strut about, pose, explain the rules to your lover and begin to slowly ease into your seductive performance. \n Take your time, start when you're ready, walk around your lover, touch him, drag your fingers through his hair and feel the beat. \n You’re free to decide, short ‘n sweet or long & languishing. You'll probably find yourself deep in the throes of passion by the end of it so consider choosing a dozen songs and enjoy the fun at the end. \n If possible, burn all the songs onto a CD or set them as a play-list on your portable music player. Don’t stop to change CDs. \n Close your eyes, feel the music, enter the trance and begin to sway. \n Try setting aside 30 minutes or so a day before to get familiar with your clothes, your body, the poses and the moves. Dance on your feet and on the floor. These may be things you’ve never done before. Try sliding down a wall and then back up. Walk around on the tips of your toes. \n On the floor, try opening and closing your legs or leaning your knees from one side to the other. Experiment with different angles. Sit on a chair. Caress your thighs, your neck, your belly your feet. Close your legs and then open them using your hands to part your thighs. Re-discover your body. Close your eyes if you’re shy. \n If you feel uncomfortable ‘dancing’ think of your performance as a slow aerobics session. Stretch, bend, split. Use your hands, stretch them out to the sides, and stroke your outstretched arm with the tips of your fingers. If you’ve practiced martial arts, yoga or Pilates, modify the posses that you’re familiar with to create your very own sexy moves. \n Think of your dance as a T'ai Chi session at the gym. Slow movements and a general sense of well-being. \n Your expression will reflect those sexy thoughts you have in mind and intensify the sexual tension in the air. Look at your body, touch it, enjoy it and then look at your lover drawing his eyes to yours and to your body. Maintain eye contact at all times. If your back is turned to your partner, glance over your shoulder. \n You’re doing this for your pleasure too. \n A blindfold will help keep your lover's senses alert - itching to know what will come next. \n A pair of handcuffs or a silky scarf can be used to keep your lover’s hands down if he breaks the no touching rule. \n Use a soft feather to brush up against your lover’s body or yours. Sit on a chair and while holding your body upright and tall, slide your feet and legs apart and slowly brush yourself from your neck to the inside of your thigh. \n If you’re wearing a button up shirt, consider also wearing a tie. Loop it around his neck to pull him closer to your face or cleavage or tie his hands up with it if he breaks the no touching rule. \n If you’re the kind of girl that likes to be naughty, have your favorite toy at hand for your pleasure and his torture. \n Tease him with a shawl or a silky wrap or use it to cover up if you feel more comfortable being a little less exposed. \n Use your hair. While standing up, kneeling, or sitting, stretch your torso while you pull your hair up and let it fall again. Use it to brush up against him. \n Use an ice cube from your cocktail. Place a cube in your mouth and run it along your lover's body or brush it across your nipples to set them firm. \n Your lips and your eyes are powerful seduction accessories. Try the classic pout or smile. Play with facial expressions. \n With a bit of practice, a hat, scarf, cane or rider’s crop can be used in sexually seductive ways. \n Dim the lights, perfume the air and light some candles. Mix candlelight with floor lamps or fairy lights. candlelight adds a soft, warm glow to your body. Indirect lighting is both flattering and more intimate. Avoid fluorescent or white LED lights. \n See that your room temperature is comfortable - feeling too cold or too hot will distract you. \n Turn off all possible distractions – TV and mobile phones etc. \n \n Check that the chair your lover will be sitting on can accommodate the both of you. Sit on it and imagine yourself in his position and then you on his lap. \n The invitation will set his mind alight and prolong the torture across an entire day. Alternatively, spring it on him as a surprise. Either way, you’ll need to spend a some time setting the scene and calming your nerves if it’s your first time. \n Have him sit with his legs closed. Start by staring him straight in the eye with a teasing smile on your face. Walk around your lover, touch him, drag your fingers through his hair and feel the beat. Strut about, pose, explain the rules to your lover and begin to slowly ease into your seductive performance. \n Run your fingers through your hair, down your neck, your chest then down to your hips and around your butt. As you move your hands across your body imagine your hands are his hands. Enjoy the touch of your (his) hands on your body. Keeping your hands in contact with your body let them ride up your sides and back towards the nape of your neck. Look him in the eye and try a slow and gentle head roll (head falls forward and then rolls back up), letting your hair fall at the same time. \n Move towards him so your crotch is almost against his knee then lean in like you're going to kiss him for just long enough that he can smell your perfume then pull away. \n Think sexy and feel sexy. Begin moving your hips to the music in a soft circular motion. Close your eyes for a few seconds and enjoy the moment. There's no-one around, just you and your lover. Take your time, then, slowly step towards your partner, one foot in front of the other, cat-walk style. When you're near enough, take your lap dance to the next level. \n Turn around and position yourself between your lover’s legs. Bend down to sit on his lap and grind your bottom slowly (and gently) into his lap. \n Top first...Seductively and gradually remove another item or two of clothing (perhaps your skirt or hot-pants) then move back towards your partner again. Get so close you'll practically be sitting on your lover's lap. Sensually lean in towards your lover's ear breathing your hot breath over it, let out a soft aching moan. Softly nibble or brush against his neck, breathing your lover in as if you were getting high off their scent. \n Keep eye contact and keep caressing yourself from different angles and perspectives. Move into the crawl and then mount him again for another grinding session. \n Move away for brief moments. Remember that eye contact is very important. Let your eyes transmit all those sexy thoughts and don’t forget to smile. \n Then move on to another part of the house or go for a walk. You may have to run... \n The possibilities are endless and the results are always great. \n He will love that! \n Make sure to use condoms though! \n 
 You will need black felt to give your mouse ears color and texture. A cardboard core will give your fabric rigidity and form. If you don't have any cardboard, you might be able to layer several pieces of rigid construction paper together with glue as a substitute. The material you use for the ears should be stiff enough to keep it from flopping around loosely once attached to the headband and if you don’t have felt, you can paint or color the cardboard black. \n Black felt \n Cardboard \n Rigid construction paper (optional) \n Household glue \n Plain paper \n Ribbon (10” (25 cm) long) \n Ribbon (3” (7 cm) long) \n You should be able to purchase everything you need for this project at your local fabric or craft store.\n The headband can be any color, but it should be at least ½" (1.27 cm) thick. You will eventually attach your mouse ears to the headband, so thicker headbands might give your mouse ears greater stability. Including a head band, you should also purchase the following tools: \n Headband \n Hot glue gun (and glue) \n Household glue \n Pencil \n Pipe cleaner \n Scissors \n You should trace two circles on your paper with a pencil or your chalk. Each circle should be between 3” and 5” (7.6 and 12.7 cm) and have a ½” (1.27 cm) tab at the bottom of the circle. These templates will be used to assist you in outlining the dimensions of your mouse ears on both fabric and cardboard. \n The tabs will on the bottom of your circles will be used to secure the ears and the headband together. \n You might be able to use the base of a bowl to help you in drawing identical circles for both of your templates. \n Place your paper template on top of the felt and trace the circle with chalk onto it. You could use a piece of tailor’s chalk, or even regular chalk in a pinch. This way, you can wipe any leftover chalk away with a damp cloth. \n Make four felt circles for every pair of ears you make. You will need to glue felt to the front and back of your cardboard core to make your mouse ears uniformly black. \n Take your scissors and follow the chalk outlines you've drawn to cut free your felt circles free from the fabric.You can add some jazzy flair to your mouse ears by using zig-zaggy pinking shears. \n Pinking shears will add a cute border to your fabric and prevent your fabric from becoming frayed., These cardboard circles will form the core of your mouse ears, making it possible for them stand up straight, just like Minnie's! Use your pencil or a piece of chalk to trace the circle template onto the cardboard. \n You will need two cardboard circles for every pair of ears you make. \n Using your scissors, follow the chalk or pencil outline you drew with your templates onto the cardboard. Be sure you don't cut off your tabs! These will be necessary to connect your mouse ears to the headband. \n You may need to touch up your cardboard and felt circles/tabs to make them as close to identical as possible. \n Compare and trim your felt and cardboard circles by holding the cardboard and felt pieces together in a stack. Then you can trim down any irregularities. \n Household glue should be sufficient to attach a piece of felt to the front and back of each cardboard circle/ear. Drizzle glue back and forth along the cardboard and press your felt into place. Press the felt to the glue firmly for five to ten minutes help it set. \n To create the best bond between your glue and the felt, you may want to allow your glue to rest for 30 minutes to an hour., Regular household glue won’t hold up to wear and tear as well as hot glue. The special glue used in hot glue guns, however, is much more durable. It will create a firm bond between ear and headband. \n You'll have to move quick after you apply your hot glue. The glue will dry quickly soon after application. \n Hot glue fresh from the gun will be very hot. Be careful not to burn yourself., Your circles should be at least 4” (10 cm) apart so that you have room for the bow that will go between the ears. You may want to mark your headband with your chalk where you'll be attaching the ears to prevent yourself from gluing them into the wrong place. \n If your headband is flexible or will permit the use of staples, you could also use a hardy stapler to connect the tabs of your mouse ears to your headband. \n Playing with your mouse ears before the glue has completely dried could cause your mouse ears to come free of the headband. To ensure you don't have to re-glue any of your pieces together, you should allow your glue to firm for 30 minutes to an hour. \n Your mouse ears might not stand straight up like Minnie Mouse's at first. To encourage your mouse ears to hold this position, fold both up and forward. The glued tabs will keep the ears in place. \n You can use either ribbon or fabric for your bow, although ribbon will likely be a little shinier and look more like the bow Minnie wears. In either case, it should be 5” to 8” (12.7 to 20.3 cm) wide. You will eventually gather this fabric around its middle, which will cause the sides to fan out. This will give your bow its shape. \n Thicker cuts of fabric will create more bunching when you gather this piece around its middle, which will give your bow a fuller appearance., This is the piece you will use to gather the fabric around the middle of your 10" (25 cm) length of ribbon. You should use a similar kind of fabric to your 10" (25 cm) ribbon, but you could also add some pop to your design by using a contrasting color fabric. \n For example, if you are using Minnie's traditional bow color, red with white polka-dots, you might choose a bold blue for your gathering string. \n Put the print side face down. You're going to want to glue your gathering string along the back of your bow, which will be the same as the opposite side of the pattern. \n You'll want each side to overlap slightly at the center of your 10" (25 cm) length of ribbon. Fold one end at a time so that there is enough overlap to glue these side where the meet at the center of the ribbon. \n It should only take a dab or two of hot glue or fabric glue to join the ends together firmly. Press the fabric firmly to create a stronger bond between the fabric and glue. \n You should follow the directions on your glue to achieve the best bond. Some glues will set and cure faster than others. Generally, you should hold the glue firmly for one to five minutes for best results., Use one hand to pinch your ribbon together toward its centermost point from the top and bottom edges. This will be easiest to do if you are working with a ribbon that is at least 5” (12.7 cm) wide. \n Pinching your ribbon together tightly will cause the outside edges to flare out more dramatically. \n The 3” (7.6 cm) piece of ribbon will hold the fabric of your bow in its flared position. Wind it around several times and then remove your fingers where you were pinching the bow in the middle. \n Hold the ribbon with your free hand to make sure it doesn't come unwound or loose. \n Wind the remaining length of your ribbon around the center tightly. \n Lift one end of the small piece of ribbon and apply a dab of hot glue or fabric glue. If using hot glue, you should be careful not to burn yourself by pressing on the fabric immediately after glue application. \n To apply pressure to make the best seal between your hot glue and fabric, you might use a tool to prevent getting burned, like a paperweight, gloved hand, or tweezers. \n Fabric glue and other cold glues should be held together firmly to encourage a strong bond. Press the glued piece of ribbon together. Hold this position for about 30 seconds to a minute. \n The bunchings of your bow fabric should have created folds through which you can thread your pipe cleaner so that it passes under your glued gathering string. \n If you find it difficult to feed your pipe cleaner through a fold and under your gathering string, you can always use glue to attach the pipe cleaner along the back of your bow. \n A dab of hot glue onto the back of your gathering string should be enough to hold your pipe cleaner in place. \n Orient your pipe cleaner so it is equal length on both sides of your gathering string. Now cross the sides of your pipe cleaner at the midpoint over the front of your gathering string and add a twist. \n This will prevent the pipe cleaner from slipping out of the bow while adding stability to the bow in general. \n Experiment with different colored pipe cleaners to personalize your Minnie Mouse ears! \n Center the bow between the ears. Then you're going to wrap each end of the pipe cleaner around opposite ends of your headband. Twine each side of the pipe cleaner down opposite ends of the headband until you go no further. \n The ends of pipe cleaner can be pointy. To prevent the wearer from getting poked, you may want to turn these inward on your headband. The ends can also be taped to the headband as an extra precaution. \n By attaching your bow to your mouse ears with a pipe cleaner, you'll be able to swap out different bows without having to make a new pair of mouse ears. \n Twist ties can be used to reinforce your pipe cleaners if you find the pipe cleaner windings are not holding the bow in place well enough. \n Minnie, being a stylish mouse, would probably go ga-ga over some rhinestones, glitter, feathers, or other accents you might add to your mouse ears. Most of these can be attached with a small dab of hot glue. Once you've finished adding your finishing touches, you should show off your mouse ears to all your friends. \n 
\n These funny numbers are T & S parameters named after some Aussie engineers. Sensitivity of a speaker is a measure of efficiency. Try and find one that is rated at more than 90 dB/watt at one metre and can take about 100 watts RMS of power. Parts express, Jaycar, and eBay are all good for various sub parts. Car subwoofer speakers WILL WORK FINE, as long as the overall ohm impedance is not lower than the receiver's. \n Try a few speakers until you find one that is suitable. Good ones are vented for efficiency and offer low low bass. This project has no vent ] but is still a solid performer. However, by cutting a round hole in it of the right diameter with the right length tube it would really take off down low. \n This may involve consulting your life partner. 130 liters (34.3 US gal) is pretty serious for a 12 or 15 inch speaker 100 liter (26.4 US gal) for a 10 inch. To calculate the volume you will be using the inside dimensions in cm (that way you will get the volume in milliliters) minus any bracing, amplifier, the back of the speaker and vents. Errors of 5% should not matter much. \n You will then be able to adjust the box's "tuning frequency" - don't worry about what this value is too much; just look at the graph and see if the vent is a reasonable length and diameter (see warnings). \n If it is still above -3dB at 35 Hz, you have some decent bass. The tuning frequency should end up somewhere between 20 Hz (wow you have got a decent speaker) and 40 Hz. All other things being equal, go lower. Below the tuning frequency speakers are relatively unhappy, so it pays to go low. \n (there is no need for any fanciness, just butt the pieces up against each other) Then get your hardware store to cut it. They will be straighter and squarer and more accurate than you (probably) which will make it easy to assemble. \n Screws at least twice as long as your MDF is thick are best. You will need to drill clearance holes to allow the screw to pass through plus smaller holes in the other pieces to allow the thread to go in. Go crazy and glue and screw some bits of wood onto the walls of the box to make it stiff. The box should vibrate as little as possible (the vibrating speaker makes the sound not the box - concrete anyone?) and be leak proof. Don't forget these brace bits (cleats) will change your box volume! \n 'Plate' amplifiers designed to mount in boxes are easy. Just remember to make sure that it does not touch the walls of its hole anywhere to avoid damage. Also remember it is a mains voltage device. If you spend 1.5 times on the amplifier what you did (or should have) on the speaker you will be OK. Matching the speaker to the amp watt for watt is good too. With an efficient speaker 200 watts is very very loud. \n Are all your corners sealed? \n Use glue. Do not stuff the box solid, this technique is for sealed, not vented boxes. \n If you don't have one, most plate amps will create their own subwoofer channel and return the rest to your amplifier or direct to your speakers (see its manual). \n If it is a bit quiet and the auto on function does not work right (most plate amps will turn on when there is a signal) and if the plate amp has a stereo input then buy a cable that splits the single channel .1 into two identical wires and connect them to the stereo plate amp inputs. \n Or put it in the front corner and try the phase switch in both directions (don't panic if you can't tell any difference). \n 
 There are many instruments to choose from the most common ones being the guitar and the drums. Learning bass can prove fruitful as well. If you are planning to start an alternative rock band you can even consider piano or the turntables.\n Really, unless you're planning to be a solo artist put together a band. Get people who can actually sing or play an instrument well too, Even if you're planning on going solo you still need someone to play the other instruments or sing backup. \n Keep believing in yourself. If you lose hope in your talents, you'll never make it anywhere. Sometimes you think you lost your talent, but you should just take a rest and come back later to try again.Dream what you want to be. Imagine yourself playing one of your songs at rock am ring in front of your fans. \n Writing constantly is the key. Practice makes perfect. \n It's a good idea to make a CD with your tracks. \n Watch their expressions. If there's a lot of concerned faces and shaking of heads, tweak a little more of your tunes. \n Sometimes they're hard to get but you need for the live entertainment experience. This is the most crucial part. The idea is to get as many gigs as possible. Visiting or phoning hundreds of pubs for two weeks straight to get as many gigs packed in as possible is very important. Also playing day after day in front of a large audience will have your performing talents skyrocket. \n Now it begins. \n Make sure the video is "cool" and will appeal to many people. \n Because then you would be a quitter, and rock stars aren't quitters as quitters don't rock. \n Don't ever lose sight of the initial reason that led you to become a rock star in the first place. \n Every genre has different ways. Rock is 1 genre but rock stars tend to stretch it out a little bit by putting their feelings, different notes, different patterns,etc. Copying other rock stars is uncool .Don't worry if your music sounds different than any normal kind of song. Its better to be totally different than to be totally the same. \n 
 The Bloated Float is a ship inn docked in the Waterfront's bay and can be entered via the door on its' side.\n It will cost you 10 gold to rent a bed for the night. Ormil can usually be found behind the inn's counter. \n Your room is located below deck and is through the door on the left - the door on the right is sealed and cannot be opened. \n He will explain that he is part of a group called the 'Blackwater Brigands' and that the ship's bouncer has been locked in the ship's storage room. After you have finished talking to him, he will attack you. \n All the 'Blackwater Brigands' are fairly easy to kill, so it will not take long to eliminate him. \n Simply walk to the door and activate it to unlock it. Graman gro-Marad will explain that he will be able to steer the ship back to the Waterfront, but that you'll need to clear the rest of the ship first. \n She will tell you that the leader of the gang is called Selene. After you have finished talking with her, she will attack you. \n Again, she will be easy to kill, so it will not take you long to defeat her. \n He will reveal that the gang are hijacking the ship in search of the treasure 'The Golden Galleon' (a fictional treasure which Ormil conjured up in order to attract customers to the inn, on which it was supposed to be hidden). After you have finished talking to him, he will attack you. \n He will be easy to kill. Graman gro-Marad will move to the top deck to guide the ship back to the Waterfront. \n She is fairly easy to kill, but her enchanted weapon drains fatigue, so you may want to try to negotiate her surrender instead. \n In order to make Selene surrender, you must talk to her and select the following dialogue in order: "I took the key from Wrath", "I'm here to join the gang", "...three months ago?", "To find the Golden Galleon", "You mean in Bravil?", "I've killed all of them." When you tell her the rest of the "Blackwater Brigands" are dead, she will surrender to you and give you her enchanted sword - the Blackwater Blade. \n If you want to kill Selene, then try killing her quickly before her sword drains all your fatigue. Loot Selene's corpse for the Blackwater Blade. \n He will tell you the story of the Golden Galleon and then tell you to rest in the bed which you rented while the ship heads back to the Imperial City Waterfront. \n When you wake up, the ship will be back at the Waterfront District. \n He will also take back all the keys for the Bloated Float. Finish talking to him and the quest will have been completed. \n 
 You will never get anywhere in middle school if you are unorganized. \n Get rid of clutter by getting rid of old papers and other miscellaneous items that you don't need anymore. Otherwise when you're looking for something, you might not find it because the thing you're looking in is too messy. \n in an organized fashion in your binder or backpack. \n Write down when handouts are due, permission slips, homework, papers, projects, and everything else. Don't just think, "I'll totally remember this!" or, "I'll get the homework assignment from a friend" most likely you won't. Just stay organized and it will improve your grades because in most schools part of your grade is whether or not you hand in homework/projects are on time. \n Write those days down in your homework planner so you can plan out when the week before is, and plan time to study. \n Well written notes taken from class can be a great study buddy! Try to study your notes a little bit every night, it can be a life saver when it comes to pop quizzes! Studying will obviously improve your grades because studying will lead to good grades on assessments and all assessment grades whether it's a test, quiz, or pop quiz. \n \n Start with making a simple list or plan. Write all of your ideas and all of the others ideas. Often, when the plan is done, it tends to be a little too much of all your ideas. When you work together to find the best ideas, let loose of the ones that aren't as impacting or important. Don't try to be sneaky and have the outcome end up being all of your ideas. The other people will notice and get annoyed and might even say something. Make sure the outcome consists your ideas and the other peoples ideas. \n Plan times when everyone involved is free and you can get together and work on the project. Don't get mad at them because of an accidental mistake. Academics always come first if you want to get good grades. Try to get as much done as possible at your meetings so the project/paper will be done fast. Usually people get into fights about what to contribute to the assignment. This shouldn't happen in your case, because of the plan. \n Make sure you listen to what other people have to say. This will help your overall report card grade because you would have worked well together and gotten the project/paper done on time. \n When you get everyone to make the plan, make sure everyone else knows and agrees that the outcome is the final decision and there is no switching around. This will really avoid fights. \n If they complain that you're being too bossy, apologize and try to be less bossy. \n Now you should have great grades which lead to happy parents. \n Nobody is going to like you or appreciate you for the true gem you can be unless you're nice, kind, sweet, and caring! \n Don't copy other peoples ideas, make your own personal creative ones that really show your personality. If you have to; ask people before you use their ideas. \n Don't compliment the same people day after day. It might get really annoying for that person; not to mention, the other people will start getting jealous. \n Everyone is at least worth a chance to be your friend! When you do this you'll eventually figure who know who is a backstabber, who is nice, who is a good friend, and who is smart. \n They will realize you guided them in to the right place and can be really thankful and really want to be your friend! Plus, they'll always think of you as "the true friend that has been nice to me from the start". \n This step may even give you a good friend from just a simple act of kindness. \n \n If you know who the popular people are, talk with them. \n Don't be afraid to make friends of the opposite gender. \n Don't be afraid to get involved with those people outside of school. \n Be nice to the younger kids. \n Respect the older kids. \n Dating and perhaps kissing is fine. Don't go too far though. Remember having a boyfriend is not a big deal and is not worth your time to be obsessed and worried over. Be happy with your friends and yourself. \n \n If you use the right brand for you, antiperspirant will not only make your sweat smell less; it will also make your armpits stay dry. \n This will really screw them up and make the hair just grow darker and faster. You can wax your arms, but no shaving your arms. \n Any brand is fine, as long as it is good quality and works. \n While the conditioner is in your hair, comb out the knots in your hair with a nice wide tooth comb. This way once your hair dries, it will feel nice and smooth. \n Dead skin is gross and unattractive. \n It's unattractive and will make your shirt look like an Appaloosa with all of it's wet spots. \n Nobody will like being around you if your breath stinks and you have tons of food globs in between your teeth! \n The key is to not overdo it. Nothing looks worse than too much makeup. Also, do what works best for you and what you feel most comfortable in. For most middle school girls, a cute simple look would be mascara, eyeliner, blush, & pink or clear lipgloss. The mascara color depends on your eyelash color. \n If they're brown or any other color, use brown. \n Black can look totally natural on some people, but really fake on others. Test out both and decide which is most natural. A thin line on the bottom lid, top lid, or maybe both is all that is needed to avoid the "raccoon" look. \n If you have more faded colored lips, then pink lip gloss is better, or even a little lip stain before the lip gloss for even more color. \n (This depends whether your skin is light or dark. Use powder for light skin, bronzer for more tanned or dark skin.) \n Experiment with the way you look and see what fits you! \n There are some people who only wear jeans and Uggs/Converse/All Stars, everyday, but they won't really look sophisticated. Yes, I suppose it is "trendy" but it's also a really boring look! \n This is important, because if you buy one that's too loose, it'll gape when you're bending over, and if you buy one too tight, it will be very uncomfortable. \n This isn't necessarily important unless you like to wear form-fitting pants or skirts. \n \n If you get Fuggs try them on and compare them to real Ugg boots. They need to be good quality knock-offs because how embarrassing would it be if your Fuggs just fell apart when you're out. People will remember you as the cheap girl who wears cheap Fuggs if that happens! \n If you can get more than one pair, high-tops, low-tops, and different colors are all great! Only buy real Converse or All Stars, if you can't afford them (they are only like $20-$40, it depends where you find them) then don't buy them. Do not get the fake converse sold at Payless/Justice et cetera. They are terrible quality. \n If you have curls, let 'em show girl! Hot waves? Hit the beach babe! Straight haired Hun? Throw it out of that bun! \n You're natural color is usually what looks best on you. \n A good trim every month or so for healthy ends works. Maybe an occasional cut for when you want a change. \n Do whatever your heart desires! \n 
 As with any illness, the more time you can give your body to rest, the faster you will likely recover from the infection. Most acute coughs are caused by the common cold or the flu, and taking time to rest can enhance your immune function and your ability to fight off the bug. \n If you cannot get time off work, see if you can cancel other commitments to give your body more rest. \n Get extra sleep if this is at all possible in your schedule. Sleep is one of the best ways to boost your immune function.\n Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day. \n It can also be helpful to use a humidifier — which vaporizes water into the air — to ease symptoms of your cough. \n The steam from a hot shower can also help to clear your airways and to improve your cough., Note that using OTC cough medications is only useful if your cough is caused from an acute respiratory infection, such as the common cold or the flu. \n Over the counter cold and cough remedies are generally not recommended for children under six years old, and their effectiveness in this age group has not proven to be effective. \n Lozenges can be purchased at most grocery stores, or at your local drugstore or pharmacy. \n The first thing to do if you have an acute cough is to determine whether you need to go into the Emergency Room, or whether it is okay to wait to see your family doctor. Indications to go straight to the Emergency Room include: \n Shortness of breath compromising your ability to breathe \n A fever indicating a possible infection \n Other underlying health issues that leave you immunocompromised (such as having HIV/AIDS or an organ transplant) \n She may offer you: \n Supplemental oxygen \n A bronchodilator, which is a medication that will relax the bronchi and bronchioles in your lungs \n Positive airway pressure, such as a CPAP or BiPAP machine \n In rare cases, ventilatory support \n He will ask you questions like: \n When did your cough begin? \n Have you had a cough like this before? \n Is your cough getting better or worse? \n Does it come in episodes, or is the cough constant? \n Things she may ask about are: \n Is it a productive cough? \n Is there blood in your cough? \n Is there a wheezy aspect to your cough? \n Things to tell your doctor about include: \n Chest pain — and whether this radiates anywhere else in your body \n Shortness of breath \n General fatigue \n Lightheadedness, dizziness, and/or fainting \n A fever \n Let your doctor know if you have a history of: \n Diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or ongoing heart disease \n Ongoing respiratory disease prior to the onset of your cough \n Acid reflux (GERD) or symptoms of heartburn, indigestion or frequent sour tastes in your mouth \n Allergic rhinitis (hay fever), which can cause a cough due to post-nasal drip \n A condition that compromises your immune system (such as HIV/AIDS or an organ transplant) \n The stethoscope can detect crackles in your lungs when there is fluid buildup (such as in cases of pulmonary oedema or pneumonia). Your doctor will also look for other signs on physical exam, including: \n An elevated "JVP" (jugular venous pressure, which assesses the amount of blood in your neck veins) — this can indicate whether there is fluid buildup such as in congestive heart failure and/or pulmonary oedema. \n Signs of hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) by assessing the circulation in your hands, and around your tongue and the inside of your cheeks (these areas show it more quickly if you are deprived of oxygen). \n Other abnormal breath sounds, such as wheezing or stridor (a harsh, vibrating sound) or decreased air movement. \n A chest x-ray may show signs of an enlarged heart, such as in congestive heart failure. It may also show fluid buildup in the lungs. It will show pneumonia if you have it, and it can also detect lung cancer. \n If the x-ray alone is inconclusive, your doctor may request that you proceed with a CT scan to look at your lungs in more detail. \n However, in many cases, the x-ray alone is sufficient to make the diagnosis and to begin a treatment plan. \n Some causes of an acute cough (such as heart-related causes, or a pulmonary embolism — a blood clot in the lung) can be ruled in or ruled out via an ECG. This is a quick and easy test to obtain so, if your doctor suspects a heart-related cause or a pulmonary embolism as the reason for your acute cough, you will likely receive this investigation. \n Your doctor may decide to do a computed tomographic (CT) scan of your chest, which can provide your doctor with more detailed images of your lungs than an x-ray. This can be used to rule out serious afflictions. \n A PE (pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lung that can lead to an acute cough) can be ruled out with a CT scan. \n This can reveal if there is an infection present, and also what type of microbe is growing there so that the antibiotic treatment can be specifically targeted to the bacteria that has infected you (if it is indeed bacterial). \n Spirometry is a type of lung function test. It can be used to diagnose asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), among other things. A COPD "exacerbation" is a common cause of an acutely worsened cough, so this is something that your doctor may wish to consider in the diagnostic process. \n Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are types of COPD. \n In more severe cases, you may need positive airway pressure (such as a CPAP machine or a BiPAP machine) or, rarely, ventilator support. \n Bronchodilators such as albuterol are also used in the event of bronchospasm. \n It is key to ensure that you are getting adequate oxygen delivery before proceeding with further treatment. \n This is not true in all cases (it depends upon the risk level of your infection, and whether it is believed to be bacterial). Your doctor can guide you as to whether antibiotic treatment is needed in your case. \n Note that, in a viral infection (or an infection caused by any microorganism other than bacteria), antibiotics will be of no benefit. \n An example of an IV blood thinner is Heparin. An example of an oral blood thinner is Warfarin (Coumadin). The purpose of blood thinning medications is to prevent any further formation of blood clots (or growth of the current blood clot), and to allow your body's natural mechanisms to dissolve the clot that is currently there. \n Note, however, that if your pulmonary embolism is severe — leading to a severe cough and debilitating shortness of breath — you may need "clot busting" drugs to break the clot apart, or a surgical intervention to remove the clot. \n You may need: \n Diuretics \n Venodilators \n Blood pressure medications \n Medications to reduce your cardiovascular risk factors \n Treatment of the underlying cause of your heart failure \n You may also need to begin oral steroids (such as Prednisone) for a short period of time, to get your cough and shortness of breath under control. \n Systemic and inhaled steroids are also used in acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis. \n If the cause of your COPD exacerbation is a respiratory tract infection, you may also need antibiotics. \n A more rare cause is: \n Cardiac tamponade, which is when blood pools around your heart leading to compression of the heart, fluid build-up in the lungs, and a resulting wet and productive cough accompanied by chest pain and shortness of breath. \n The treatment for a cardiac tamponade is "pericardiocentesis" (a needle inserted into your chest cavity to remove the blood that has pooled around your heart). \n In the event that the cough is due to acid reflux, H2 blockers or PPI's may be helpful to relieve symptoms, and also lifestyle changes (avoiding spicy and acidic foods, elevating head of bed for sleep). \n If the cough is due to allergic rhinitis, nasal corticosteroids may prove helpful as well as oral antihistamines. \n 
 They can be whatever you want. Just make sure you will be comfortable. I recommend a sleep T-shirt or tank top, sleep shorts, slippers, and a robe if you have one.\n If you would like, lay them out on your bed and just take your robe or slippers in the bathroom, and after you shower, you could get dressed in your room. Whatever you want. \n Start by brushing your hair out thoroughly. Doing this will give the blood vessels in your head a stimulation, causing more blood flow to the head. Brushing your hair before showering will also let shampoo and conditioner clean your hair more thoroughly. \n Get into the shower and thoroughly wet your entire body, leaving not an inch of yourself dry. \n Focus mostly on your scalp and the tips of you hair. \n Leave the Conditioner in for 3-5 Minutes. \n Wash yourself Thoroughly. Don't forget to scrub your feet, underarms, behind your ears, neck, and your private parts. \n Get a bit of soap or shaving cream, and rub it on your legs. Slowly and softly bring the razor up your legs, being careful not to cut yourself. If you tend to shake and accidentally cut yourself while shaving, inhale and then when you slowly exhale, slowly pull the razor up your leg. The exhale will calm you, leaving you less shaky. Do the same with your underarms if necessary. \n This will close your pores up after taking a hot shower. \n You can also do this for your hair if you want. Get a face towel and blot your face to dry it. Do not rub! It will irritate your face and cause skin peeling and redness. \n Use an exfoliating scrubby with a reputable face wash. Good brands to use are Neutrogena and Aveeno. \n Blow drying it will cause heat damage. Nothing about split ends and dry, lifeless hair is pretty. \n This will make your nails look healthy and shiny without even trying. You could also paint your nails, if you'd like. Nail art is optional. \n Clip your toenails and add fresh coats of paint. \n Now you probably feel fresh and beautiful! \n 
 You’ll need measuring tape, a pencil, and a book or a ruler (or some other flat surface)., Their head should be facing straight ahead, and not tilted upwards or downwards, so you do not get a faulty measurement of their height. \n Make sure their feet are side by side, with both feet firmly on the floor and their heels touching the wall.Allow your child to keep their shoes on, as they will be wearing them when they ride the bike. \n Place the ruler, book or other flat surface on your child’s head. The ruler should be positioned against the wall, parallel with the floor. Mark where the ruler touches the wall with a pencil., Once you have marked the point on the wall, have your child move aside so you can measure their height. Extend the measuring tape from the point you have marked to the floor and write down the measurement. This dimension is the height of your toddler.Keep in mind that kid’s bikes are measured by the size of the wheels, not the frame height. Bikes for toddlers usually range from 12 and 16 inches. \n In general, 12-inch wheels are designed for children 36-40 inches tall, 16-inch wheels are for children 41-49 inches tall, and 20-inch wheels are for children 50-56 inches tall., Measuring their inseam is important because you need to be sure your child can place their entire foot on the ground while on the bike. If the bike is too big and your child cannot put their feet down, it will be hard for them to balance and they may get frustrated while trying to learn how to ride. \n You can easily determine your child’s inseam measurement if they try the bike before you purchase it. But if you are buying a bike without your toddler, you will need to measure their inseam. \n Write down the measurement on a piece of paper and take it with you when you go bike shopping for your toddler. \n Place the string on the floor, between the child's feet, and stretch it to the child's crotch. Then, put your finger on the place on the string to indicate the height of their crotch. Move the string and cut with it with scissors at the place where your finger is. Measure the length of tape using a ruler. \n Keep in mind that toddlers with an inseam up to 18 inches and a height up to 40 inches need a bicycle with 12-inch wheels. Toddlers who have an inseam up to 18 inches and are taller than 40 inches need 16-inch wheels., The diameter of the bike’s wheels should be clearly labelled on the bike’s packaging or the box. Ask the sales associate at the store if you are not sure where to find the diameter of the bike’s wheels. \n If you are purchasing a used bike, use a yardstick or measuring tape to measure the diameter of the tire. Start on the outside of the tire and pull the measuring tape straight across until you get to the other side of the tire--the number on your measuring tape with be the tire’s diameter. \n Use your child's height and inseam measurements to find the right diameter size for the wheels. You can also access a size chart onlineto determine the right wheel diameter for your child, based on their age. \n If you have a two or three year-old who is tall, it is better to provide him with a smaller bike that has 12-inch wheels because they will sit lower in the seat. It will also make it easier to for them to reach the bike’s handlebars. \n If your child is older, but short for their age, choose a bicycle with 16-inch wheels. Older children have longer legs and arms, so a smaller bike will be awkward for them to use., Loosen the screw under the bike seat, located where the seat goes into the frame. When you loosen it, you will then be able to move the seat up on or down to suit your child. \n To ride the bike easily and comfortably, your child’s knee will be slightly bent when the pedal is in the down position, as this allows a stronger stroke on the pedal than when their leg is stretched out. \n When the pedals are in the up position, your child’s thighs should be horizontal and not stick out. \n Correct handlebar placement is especially important when your child is first learning how to balance and steer a bike. \n Your child should be able to sit upright and be close to the handlebars but their knees should not hit the handlebars when they pedal.Your child should also be able to comfortably place both hands on the grip pads and have enough movement to turn easily., Press them with your little finger, as children do not have the same pressure in their fingers as adults. If you can press the brake levers with your little finger without much effort, your toddler will be able to press them too., Most childrens’ bikes come with adjustable handlebars and seats because children grow quickly, so it shouldn’t be hard to find an adjustable bike. \n Some bikes come with quick-release adjustments, so adjustments can be made without needing any tools, but this also makes it easier for bike parts to be removed and stolen. \n Other bikes come with a traditional adjustment system, which can require basic tools or special parts that are often included with the bike. \n Check to see what type of adjustment system is on your child’s bike and look for one that matches your adjustment preferences. \n Always bring your child with you to test a used bike before purchasing it, and make sure the brakes work and that all the other pieces are in order. \n Don’t be afraid to ask the seller questions about how old the bike is and if it has been in any major crashes. Used bikes are best if they are on their newer side (only a few years old) and haven’t been in any major crashes. \n If the bike doesn’t fit or isn’t in a safe condition, walk away and look for a better option. Used bikes are sometimes stolen merchandise being resold. If you are suspicious that the used bike might be stolen, look for the serial number, which is usually located underneath the main support post. Contact the police department or search the internet with the serial number and description of the bike to see if any stolen bike reports matching the number appear. \n Employees at specialty stores tend to receive better training so they can recommend the correct bike size and features for your child. \n When sitting on the seat with their hands on the handlebars, a child should be able to place the balls of both feet on the ground at the same time.Your child should be able to straddle the tallest bar on the bike while still having their feet flat on the ground on both sides of the bike, which helps them quickly stop the bike or get off if they start to fall.If your child can’t fulfill these requirements, try a smaller size bike or adjust the seat so it is on a lower setting. \n This bike style is a popular option and comes in very small sizes. This bike looks like a typical toddler bike, but does not have pedals, so your toddler can straddle the bike and walk with it. Balance bikes are a good starting point for young children because they give them the feel of a bike and will teach them to steer and control the bike without having to use pedals. \n They can be used by children as young as 18 months old. \n Once they are ready for a real bike, you can add training wheels to this style. \n Training wheels should be attached next to the rear wheel and should start flush with the ground. As your child gets more comfortable balancing on the bike, you can raise the training wheels, which will force them to balance on their own.Often, toddlers that start with balance bikes can skip the training wheel phase or go through it quickly.Keep an eye on your child to monitor their progress and comfort levels. \n This way, your child can pedal backwards to brake. Young children don’t have the hand strength or coordination to use hand brakes.In fact, children younger than six should only use coaster brakes. \n Most bikes come with hand brakes when they are have 16 inch wheels and bigger, which the average child will fit into when they are 6-7 years old.Make sure the brakes can be activated quickly and have the power to stop the bike. Have your child test the brakes, and then test them yourself with a hand or foot to see how quickly they react. \n These styles aren’t ideal for children until they have a firm grasp on riding a bike. \n Once your child becomes a more confident rider, you can experiment with bikes for different types of terrain. \n All children should learn to ride a bike on a flat, even surface, like cement. If your child will be riding on dirt roads or cobblestone paths, look for a bike with larger shocks for a more comfortable ride. \n For best results and personal recommendations, consult a biking professional at a sporting goods or biking store. \n In general, the less expensive bikes will be heavier because they are made of steel instead of the more expensive alloy metals.Steel bikes are still safe, but can be slightly more difficult to maneuver and are heavier if your child crashes and gets trapped under their bike. \n Helmets are required by law in most states when riding in public places, and they are always a good idea for young children learning to ride a bike. Helmets also reduce the risk of bicycle-related head injury by 88%.A helmet is only effective if it fits your child’s head properly. The right helmet will rest just above your child’s eyebrows and sit level around their entire head. It shouldn’t move around on their head when shaken, and the strap should be snug but still allow your child room to move their mouth and talk. \n Helmets that are designed specifically for biking are best, but your child can also wear a helmet designed for another activity, like rollerblading or skateboarding, as long as it fits them properly. \n Though these are not required, it may be beneficial to protect your child from the typical falls and stumbles that may happen when they first learn how to ride. \n Most pad sets are sold according to the height, age, and weight of a child. Use the same measurements you took for correct bike sizing to choose the correct pad size. \n Have your child try the pads on to ensure they are comfortable. You also ask a store employee to help you with sizing and material recommendations for safety gear. \n 
 This will reduce the stress on your pelvic floor muscles, and may help to improve (or at least to prevent worsening of) your vaginal prolapse. \n Keep in mind that surgery is not necessary with vaginal prolapse. You can leave the prolapse untreated without any negative impact on your health.\n The pessary will hold your vaginal structures in place, thus preventing symptoms of prolapse and/or worsening of your prolapse. You will need to see your doctor to discuss this treatment option and to have it inserted into your vagina. \n A vaginal pessary must be removed and cleaned at regular intervals. \n Your physician can instruct you on how to do this, as well as the frequency at which it needs to be done. \n Some women find vaginal pessaries uncomfortable, or find that they fall out and have difficulty keeping them in place. \n Try a pessary and to see how you feel with it in. You can evaluate from there whether you find it a helpful mode of treatment. \n Vaginal pessaries are more successful in women who are not sexually active than in women who are. If you are sexually active, you or your partner can remove the pessary for intercourse., Do Kegel exercises at least 3 times per day, ultimately aiming for 10 repetitions each time. Here's how to effectively perform Kegel exercises: \n To identify your pelvic muscles (the ones you will be flexing during Kegel exercises), stop urinating mid-stream. Notice which muscles you used to do this task - this feeling of muscle tightening is what you will be aiming for when you perform the exercises (which is recommended to do when you are not urinating - the urination test is simply used to allow you to identify the muscles). \n When lying down or sitting comfortably, contract your pelvic muscles and hold the contraction for 5 seconds. Then, release for 5 seconds, and then repeat this 5 times. Ultimately, you will want to aim to hold the contraction for 10 seconds, to release for 10 seconds, and to repeat this 10 times. \n Stay relaxed as you perform the exercise and do not hold your breath. Rather, continue to breathe deeply as you perform the exercises. \n Kegel exercises are not meant to be tiring; they are more about focus, as you keep your mind focused on the contractions that will effectively strengthen these muscles. \n If you have difficulty performing Kegels, then let your doctor know. You may need a referral to see a physical therapist for help. \n They are linked to the decreased estrogen that is present post-menopause, as a decreased estrogen level correlates to a weakening of the vaginal area and the surrounding muscles and ligaments. \n The most common way to deliver the estrogen is to insert an estrogen cream into your vagina, but any form of estrogen will work. However, keep in mind that homeopathic remedies cannot replace this therapy. \n Estrogen replacement therapy can help to prevent this natural weakening of the pelvic muscles and ligaments, and hence to reduce the risk of any further vaginal prolapse. \n Note that there are some cases in which estrogen replacement therapy is not safe. These include people with certain types of cancers whose growth may be fuelled by the presence of estrogen (such as many breast cancers), as well as those who are at an increased risk of blood clots and stroke, among other things. \n Your doctor will be able to go over the risks and benefits of estrogen replacement therapy in your specific case, to help you decide whether this treatment is right for you. \n The type and extent of the surgery will vary depending upon the type and severity of your prolapse. \n This is something that your surgeon will assess and discuss with you after he or she has performed a physical exam to thoroughly assess the extent of your vaginal prolapse. \n As you await surgery, you may be offered treatments such as a vaginal pessary to help control your prolapse until it can be corrected surgically. \n Also, keep in mind that there is no medical reason why surgery has to be done. \n Tell your doctor if you have had problems with general anesthesia in the past, or if you have a family history of problems tolerating anesthetic. Most people are completely fine with it; however, it is important to talk with your doctor about any concerns you may have. \n Some women just receive a spinal or an epidural for pain control during surgery. \n While general anesthesia is normally recommended, these are other options that can be considered. \n In vaginal surgery, the surgery is conducted through the vaginal opening. In laparoscopic surgery, small instruments are inserted into the abdominal cavity though tiny incision points, with the help of a small camera that allows the surgeon to see during the operation. \n Unless there are complications, you will most likely need to stay in the hospital for one to two days following surgery. This will help to ensure that the initial stages of your recovery are going well. \n Recurrence after having prolapse surgery can be as high as 20 to 60%. To reduce your risk, be diligent about doing Kegels, limiting lifting, and any other preventative measure that your doctor suggests after surgery. \n Ask your boss for modified duties at the workplace if you have a job that involves heavy physical labor. \n Your doctor may advise that you do Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles in your pelvic area following surgery. \n Be sure to follow your doctor's advice on when to begin strengthening exercises, and how many to do at a time, so that you do not put undue stress on your pelvic area following surgery. \n Also avoid sexual intercourse for 6 weeks following surgery, to allow time for a full recovery., Being overweight can significantly increase your risk of recurrence of the condition following surgery, due to the continual extra pressure in the area. Therefore, to minimize your risk as much as possible, and to ensure that the benefits of surgery last for as long as possible, you may want to consider weight loss. \n Strategies to reduce your weight (if you are overweight) include increasing your aerobic (fat-burning) exercise, and improving the health of your diet, among others. \n Click here for more information on how to lose weight safely and effectively if this is of interest to you. \n You will also want to ask your doctor to treat chronic conditions such as a persistent cough or ongoing constipation, which may put additional stress on your abdominal and pelvic floor muscles. \n You can return to normal activity fully by six to nine weeks after surgery, and your surgeon can advise you on a plan for a gradual return to activity during this time period. \n Note that sexual problems may persist even after the surgery is complete. \n The surgery will most likely resolve the anatomic problem (the prolapse), but it will not necessarily resolve associated sexual challenges. \n If you are struggling to get your sex life back on track, you can ask your doctor for suggestions or for a referral to a physician who specializes in women's sexual health and wellbeing. \n Challenges that are common include pain with intercourse and decreased libido, among other things. \n 
 Do what you can. \n Lord, I expect Your blessing as Your will is done in my life." This approach holds true in business, at home or in school. Ask the guidance of our Almighty Father. Always ask his permission and blessing in everything you do; don't forget to pray about your dreams in life. \n Then trust God to strengthen you. \n Know your privileges of asking for assistance in the situation and overcome your doubt. God blesses those who believe Him and act on that faith with confidence in Him. The second you need to do is hard work to reach your dreams. Always think positive about your dreams. Always remember this saying "If others can do it, why can't I?" \n God promises to show you His will in John 16:13, "However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come." Jeremiah 33:3, ‘Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.’ \n Help me to show your Love to others. Pray with thankfulness: "Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving." Colossians 4:2 \n Forgive so that you can be forgiven! Be a peacemaker and peace keeper... \n Words of faith in God are the most powerful things in the Universe. God said, "Let there be light" and there was light. It was His will. Yes, it's like the law of gravity will tell you that you can't last very long walking in the air. So you must believe God's promises (His will.) are laws that are as sure as gravity. Believe to receive. \n That is what it is: it's yours. You must continue praising God for the answer whatever it is--even if you do not agree with the timing or the way it comes. \n Go forward believing; look up and expect the answers to happen, and leave them to the power of the will of God. If your dreams don't come true don’t get depressed and most of all don't loose hope. Always remember that God may be preparing a better dream for you to fulfill. Remember also that in every failure and success there is always a reason. When God closes one door, He opens another. \n\n He sees it all. \n It will never work! \n \n Justice is coming and "you shall receive the desires of your heart," so watch the bad attitudes or your "rewards" can be opposite of your desires whether in the short or long run. \n \n One is never perfect, but "God is always just." He knows how one accepts His good graces, gifts, shares his abilities, and knowledge and how one, then forgives those who seek forgiveness and does not despise the weak or hopeless. \n And, believe that He is already answering your prayer... it's that little thing called "faith"!"Do not fret... or be envious of those who do wrong... 'Trust' in the LORD, and 'do good'... 'Delight' yourself 'in the LORD' and he will give you the desires of your heart. 'Commit' your way to the LORD..." Psalms 37:1 - 5

 Read through numerous job postings for an EEG technician to see what employers are looking for in applicants relative to experience and training.\n Required aptitudes to successfully become an EEG technician include the ability to understand and work with specialized medical equipment as well as having excellent interpersonal and communication skills. \n Your curriculum in high school should include some preparatory coursework in science including biology and chemistry as well as basic mathematics and computer skills. \n Your options include certificate and degree programs at community colleges. Consider the costs for tuition and financial aid programs that the colleges may offer. \n Some examples include working at facilities for sleep disorders and operation room monitoring. Additional coursework may be required as preparation for a specialization. \n Review the curriculum to help you select the best training program that will properly prepare you to enter the field and get a job. \n Obtaining future registration and certification following graduation may require that you attend an accredited program during your training. \n An internship will provide you with an additional learning experience during your studies and you will acquire important skills and knowledge as well. \n If you are already enrolled in a college degree program, this option will provide you with hands-on work experience to supplement your coursework and studies. \n This will take from 12 to 24 months depending on the type of program that you choose. Prepare for and obtain certification as an EEG technician. Required continuing education after graduation is typical within the field to maintain your certificate. \n 
 The placement test helps you decide whether or not an algebra class is right for you. Maybe you don't need algebra, or maybe you need to take a different math class to prepare you for algebra. Usually, a placement test is free and comes with an appointment with the academic counselor; they will be able to tell you about your specific situation.\n When registering for a college course, you can choose your own professor. Ask around and find out about the different professors. Choose a section taught by a quality professor that you think would fit with your learning style. \n Choose a section that also fits with your schedule allowing you to attend every class. \n Use websites that have reviews from students have taken the course with that professor to find out who would be a good fit for you. \n Many community colleges have testing centers that allow you to schedule your exams to be taken outside of the classroom. This can allow for flexibility in case you need a few more days of study. You also may be given more time to finish the exam than you would during a normally scheduled class period. \n Speak with your professor at the beginning of the course about scheduling exams outside the classroom. \n If this course is essential to you continuing on to the next course, make it the highest priority when you’re choosing your schedule. If you are a morning person, choose a section that meets in the morning when you are awake and ready to learn. If the best section fills up before you can schedule it, try speaking directly to the professor and explaining why it’s important for you to attend class at that particular time. \n Many people tend to lose focus after lunch time so if you’re not a morning person choose a section between 10am and 12pm or after 3pm. \n If you have the opportunity to do so, taking the class on its own allows you to spend all of your time and energy on truly understanding algebra. Not having to split your attention between multiple courses lets you focus specifically on the task at hand. \n If you really want to succeed at a four-year college, take college algebra at a community college the summer before to gain a solid foundation in math. \n Homework, quizzes, and exams will likely have different point values associated with them. Knowing what percentage each contributes to your grade can help you further in the course if you are struggling. Avoid falling behind because you didn’t put in the time to do the homework properly! \n Determine how much time you will need to spend each week to really master the course. Make sure to set aside this time by scheduling it into your day. \n Pre-algebra includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. These concepts are essential for understanding the more complicated algebraic concepts. \n Find online tutorials that have quizzes associated with them to ensure your mastery of this material. \n Give yourself a head start on the material by looking through the book before the course begins. If you have time, work through some of the concepts and identify the ones that are particularly difficult for you. \n By getting ahead in your College Algebra (or any other math) studies you will have already worked through some problems and you will have intelligent questions to ask your teacher about the material. \n If your bookstore stocks them, buy a copy of the student solution manual. This will make your homework sessions much easier. \n Your professor didn’t spend all of that time putting together a syllabus for no reason. The syllabus is a roadmap to the entire course, telling you what material will be covered each class, when homework is due, and when quizzes and exams will be. \n Write down all class times, study sessions, quizzes, exams, and project due dates in your planner. This helps you keep track of when everything is due and helps you make academics a priority. Pay special attention to exam study sessions and exams that fall outside of your normal schedule and/or class location. \n Make sure you have enough time to take algebra. A good rule of thumb is to schedule two hours of homework and studying for every hour of class. If you do not have enough time to take this class due to other commitments in your life, either make time for this class or wait until you do have the time. \n Refer back to your syllabus to see what part of the textbook will be covered during your next class. Read that section and work some of the problems to check your understanding. Take some notes during your reading to refer back to while studying for quizzes and exams.Come to class prepared to ask questions about the parts that you didn’t understand. \n If you don't go to class, it's much harder to learn on your own. Math is a cumulative subject, so if you don't know the foundation, it's difficult to grasp later concepts.Just going to class is not enough, you also need to actively pay attention. \n Pay special attention during demonstrations. Some algebra concepts are best when demonstrated. It is hard to use words to describe how a circle, an ellipse, a parabola and a hyperbola can come from the same cone, but when the professor takes out a model and shows you how to "cut" the cone, conic sections are much easier to understand. \n Write down or draw everything your professor presents on the board as well as any verbal hints they give. Write or draw everything the exact same way the professor writes or draws it on the board. This will help you study your notes later. If the professor asks a question in class, think about it and answer it if you know it. \n Ask questions if you are confused. It is likely that other students have the same question you do. \n Review your notes frequently to solidify your comprehension of the material. If there is something you can’t quite grasp, ask your professor for help. \n Do all of the homework, even if it is not collected or graded. Homework is practice for exams. When you do your homework, you study for the test at the same time. Just reading your notes may be enough for other courses, but it is not enough to help you pass algebra.Check the homework when you are done. If you have the student solutions manual, you can see how to do each problem step by step. If you do not have a student solutions manual, your book will have the answers at the back of the book. Make sure you get the problems right before moving on to the next section. \n Ask questions on the homework. Write a list of problems that you had while doing the homework and take it to the next class. Make sure you give the questions a good try first; you may be able to solve them yourself. \n Your math professor may show your class how to use a specific calculator or computer program. Learn the program or instrument inside out. If you have been out of school for even a few years since your last math class, make sure you know how to use the most recent calculators or programs. Find an online tutorial for more practice. \n Understanding how to represent functions of a graph is key to understanding algebra. With graph paper, you can learn important graphing and visualization skills. These skills will help you in algebra and any higher math class. \n Office hours are time set aside specifically by your professor to help you if you have questions. Take advantage of this one-on-one time if there is a concept you are really struggling with. Try to figure out exactly what it is you don’t understand instead of just walking in and saying, “I don’t get it”.Alternatively, you can use the math lab if your school has one. Visit it to find help when you need it. If you are afraid of asking the staff members in the lab, ask the student workers (if they are available); almost every student math lab worker has taken algebra. Try to come in during times of less traffic so that you don't have to wait for help. \n Many community colleges and universities have a certain number of free tutoring hours offered to students. Find a time that works best for you and attend a session. If you’re struggling with a particular topic, focus on that until it makes sense. \n Find out about your college’s policy at the beginning of the year. You may lose the tutoring privileges if you don’t use them in the first semester. \n If you have the time and the capacity, a study group is a great way to stay on top of the material. Study groups are also good for working through homework and complex concepts. Someone in your group may understand something really well and be able to explain it to you in a way that clarifies the concept for you.Set up a weekly or every other week meeting time. \n A short one-on-one tutoring session can be more beneficial to you than hours of group work in class because it allows you to focus specifically on what doesn’t make sense. Although it may seem expensive, it is usually cheaper to pay for tutoring than to pay for retaking the course later. \n Find a tutor that fits and understands your learning style. If you start with one tutor and it isn’t working for you, don’t hesitate to find another one. \n Using a test from a previous year is a great way to get more practice for the exam. It will give you an idea of the format of the exam and the difficulty of the questions. Work the test questions and then check your answers. What you got wrong is your lesson plan for concepts to work on. \n Not only do the quizzes and homework count for a grade, but they are also good practice for the final exam. When you get a quiz or homework back, check to see what you did wrong. Do the problems again for practice and make sure you don't make the same mistakes again.A good quiz average may also help you pass if your test grades are on the pass/fail fence. You’ll be less likely to make the same mistake a second time if you’ve reworked the problems. \n Before an exam, most professors will put together a review assignment that covers all of the topics that you will see on the test. Completing the review will give you an idea of the topics you really understand and the ones you might need to study a little more before exam day. \n Use all the resources you have available to you to finish the review and study. Refer to your notes, textbook, previous homework assignments, and online help if necessary. \n If you don’t show the work of how you arrived at an answer, you are at risk of getting the whole question wrong even if you just added the last two numbers at the end incorrectly. \n Showing your work lets the professor know that you understand the concept, you may have just made a small arithmetic error. \n If you come across a problem that you are unsure of, skip it and move on. You can always go back to those problems at the end of the test and focus on them once you’ve answered everything else. Don’t forget that you can also ask questions during the exam. Your professor may not be able to answer it, but it doesn’t hurt to ask. \n If you have stayed on a consistent study schedule, you won’t need to cram because you will have been reviewing everything all along. Make sure you aren’t hungry during the test, either. \n

 Do you want something pre-built, or want to assemble your own? RTF stands for Ready To Fly and includes everything including controller and battery, while ARF is Almost Ready to Fly, which assembly and the purchase of all necessary electronics (servos, ESC, receiver, battery, etc.) separately. PNF stands for Plug-n-Fly, often requiring you to buy your own battery, receiver, and transmitter separately. Do you want electric or glow (gas)? If you want to build the entire plane yourself, kits are also available.\n Beginner planes are typically electric RTF trainers in the $50-$300 price range including battery and controller. A good Internet search is "RTF trainer. If you have a brick-and-mortar hobby shop in your area, be sure to visit it. The employees there will be extremely helpful and knowledgeable, especially if it's a reputable store. \n Most RC planes, even RTF ones, require a bit of assembly. \n Turn on the transmitter, then the airplane. Check the direction of flight surfaces (have someone experienced check you). \n There are different conventions about which stick does what. These are called "modes," and there are 4 main ones - Mode 1, Mode 2 etc. It is best to use a mode which is used by any instructor or the most common to other flyers in your area. Mode 2 is the most commonly used mode in the US. \n Don't fly if the ribbon is parallel to the ground! Under 30 degrees is perfect. \n If possible, launch INTO the wind. If you are taking off from a runway and the wind is perpendicular to the runway, it is possible to take off, but not advisable for a beginner. \n Once the plane is almost floating above the ground, bring the elevators (usually up-down on the right side) up about 30% and let the plane get off the ground. If you're hand launching, advance the power to full and give the plane a straight level and firm (not too hard) toss into the air and quickly grab the controls. If you are still learning, have someone else launch your airplane for you so you can keep your hands on the sticks. \n I usually fly what we call 3 mistakes high, which is 150–200 feet (45.7–61.0 m) up, then reduce the throttle to half power. \n Just push the stick over for a split second and release. Simulator training will make you better at this. \n This will roll the plane slightly to the side. You will also need to pull back on the appropriate control stick slightly to pull the plane through the turn. To complete the turn, roll the plane parallel to the ground. Remember to always keep the plane upwind, this way it won’t blow away from you.(this only applies if you turn with ailerons. \n If you do stall, recover by pushing the nose down until the aircraft is flying fast enough to generate lift again. This may seem counterintuitive, but pulling back on the stick further will only make your situation worse in a stall. \n When you find yourself comfortable with this pattern, try flying an oval in the opposite direction (let other pilots around know what you are doing so they know to avoid you if you are flying an opposite pattern). When comfortable with both directions try a figure 8 pattern. \n Reduce power slowly (don’t touch the (elevator) stick - to descend, simply reduce the throttle). You want the plane to almost glide on its own. When the plane is about 5 feet (1.5 m) from the ground, cut the throttle. \n Note that this only applies to aircraft with a tailwheel, tricycle-gear airplanes should touch down on the back two wheels first and then let the nose settle down onto the runway. \n 
 This is usually a multiple of 100 (most often 500), but players can determine it to be lower or higher depending on how long they want the game to last. \n You can have more or fewer, but tournament Spades is usually played in groups of four. If playing in teams, players should sit across from each other. This works best at a square table with a player on each side. \n Though not required, Spades etiquette is that all players refrain from picking their cards up before all the cards are dealt out. \n If the number of players is not a factor of 52, simply deal until everyone has the same maximum number of cards and discard the remainder. \n If players wish to arrange their cards in order of suit or rank, they should take this opportunity to do so. Keep in mind that arranging your cards too hastily can reveal information about your hand to the other players that you don't want them to know, so be discreet! \n Bidding consists of a player looking at their cards and determining how many tricks they think they can win. For example, if you bid two tricks, you're betting that you'll win at least two tricks. If your game of Spades involves partners, you and your partner's bids are combined into a contract. If you bid two tricks and your partner bids three, the two of you have to win a total of five tricks to complete your contract. \n The first player to bid is typically the one to the left of the dealer, proceeding in a clockwise direction. \n Make sure to write down the bids so you don't forget who bid what as the game goes on. \n Every player must bid at least one trick; you cannot pass unless you are playing the nil bids variant of the game (see below). \n In customary Spades games, each player has to bid that they'll take at least one trick. One variant of this is to allow nil bids or blind nil bids. Agree upon this variation before bidding begins. \n A nil bid is bidding that you won't take any tricks. A player might get a bonus of 100 points, for example, if they bid nil and don't take any tricks, and a penalty of -100 if they do take at least one trick. \n A blind nil bid is when you bet that you won't take any tricks before looking at your cards. In some variations, a player bidding blind nil may exchange two cards from his or her hand with a partner.In some variations, a player may only bid blind nil if they are behind by at least 100 points. \n Blind nil bids that are successfully met get 200 points; blind nil bids that are overdrawn get -200 points. \n Going in a clockwise direction, the first player puts down a card from their hand. This card cannot be a spade, since this is the trump suit for all other cards. Players put down cards one after the other, following the suit of the first card. \n For example, if Player 1 leads with the 7 of Clubs, each other player, if possible, must put down a club this round. Although the other players cannot see your cards, it is impossible — and bad etiquette — to lie about which suits you have, as players will keep track if you fail to put down the lead suit. \n In Spades, cards are valued according to face-value: Ace is the highest and 2 is the lowest card value. For each trick, the player who lays down the highest card value takes all the cards, sets them face down next to their area, and records one trick. \n Therefore, in a trick which contains the 3 of spades (lead card), 8 of spades, 10 of spades, and K of spades, the player who put down the K wins the trick. \n In a trick which contains the 5 of hearts (lead card), the 2 of hearts, the 6 of hearts, and the 4 of hearts, the player who put down the 6 wins the trick. \n If a trick is lead with a 4 of diamonds, and the next player in line does not have a single diamond card, s/he has the option of either discarding from a non-trump suit (a club or heart, in this case), or trumping with a spade. If a spade is played, the highest spade wins the trick. \n In a trick which contains the 6 of hearts (lead card), 7 of hearts, Q of clubs, and K of diamonds, the player who put down the 7 of hearts wins the trick. \n In a trick which contains the J of clubs (lead card), 2 of spades, 6 of clubs, and 3 of spades, the player who put down the 3 of spades wins the trick. \n Common rules dictate that players can lead with any suit except for spades, as these are trump cards. This rule is set is place in order to prevent a player with a glut of trumps to use them, one after the other, early on, thereby depleting other players' trumps. \n At this point, all cards should be absent and tricks should be divided among the players. \n Count the total number of tricks you won. (Each trick should be a set of four cards, so divide your total cards by four to get the total number of tricks.) \n If you bet five tricks, and you won at least five tricks, multiply the number of contracts by 10 to get your score. (Four bid tricks and four won tricks gives you a point total of 40.) If you bid five tricks, for example, but only collected four tricks, multiply the number of tricks bid by 10, but turn that into a negative number. (Four bid tricks but only three tricks won gives you -40 points.) \n If, for example, you bid three tricks and win four, you receive 30 points for meeting your bid, but an extra point for exceeding it. You'll therefore have 31 points. \n Once you have a total of 10 sandbag points, you're penalized 100 points. This total runs throughout the game, so be careful about winning extra tricks! \n Play continues in this fashion until one person/team reaches the score set at the beginning of the game. \n 
, (And, it helps if you understand at least the basic chords and some music theory for harmony, etc.) \n You have to make the chords fit the melody notes -- not the other way around. Try to avoid clashing notes. There are several ways to do this. If the song has a "left hand" look in it, and if the structure isn't too complicated, listen to the section you're putting a chord into and decide if it is major or minor. \n Unless the song is really complicated, one of those should fit. By simply analyzing the section in which you're placing a chord, the tonic (first note, I) of the melody chord/key will usually be seen here and there in the bar(s) of the melody where you are looking to fit your chord. \n For the minor scales the roman numerals for chords are lowercase i-iv-v: that's the tonic(i) sub-dominant(iv) and dominant(v)... Write these down somewhere so you can refer to them, because they will come up a lot in theory of harmony! \n You can start by using chords I and V (first and fifth) "of the scale of the key" are very commonly used. So the 1st chord of the scale for the key C Major is the tonic (I) "C Major" chord (C-E-G) and then chord "(V) is G Major" (G-B-D) and so use whichever sounds better in progressions upward and downward in different parts of the song... \n \n Just repeat these chords to the beat if you're not sure, and write down the one that sounds the nicest. Don't be afraid to mix them around if you find another chord sounds nicer! \n The chord is highly dependent on which melody notes are being used in that part of the song. So an understanding of theory is helpful -- if for example: the notes of the melody are in the key of C (C-E-G) then you have the sub-dominant "4th chord (F)" which fits right in, or chord the "fifth chord (G)", and of course "B (the VII)" may work as it closely relates to "G7", and naturally D, F chords may be comfortable, all being in, of or near C Major. \n Thus, depending on what notes are used like high notes "G or A" in the melody then the second inversion of the C chord could accompany this group. \n If, however, the higher notes (E, F, or sometimes G) are used, the first inversion of C would be played to give a different tonality. \n Many a musician can play in a rhythm section -- does not read much music -- but learns and plays harmony to the melody by blending among other instrumentalists by ear (improvising). \n The notes of the melody are not the first consideration for strumming, picking, and arpeggio piano chording kind of musician... who is in key and harmonizes to the key, but is not really "clued" to knowing the exact melody line or harmony theory... \n One may be a good recording session player or band member par excellence by knowing chords inside and out without reading the sheet music, ie: for purposes of commercial/professional entertainment or church music! \n This allows playing chords in any key as the tonic to a melody and to allow easy key changes by counting up and down by musical steps and 1/2 steps (sharps and flats)... \n 
\n While not absolutely essential for Windows users, the combination of a local email client with the Enigmail plugin will eliminate a number of hassles including writing and encrypting your email in one program and then cutting and pasting encrypted text into another. \n It cannot be run by itself. Enigmail takes care of the day-to-day operations of sending and receiving secure emails, keys, and digital signatures, making security procedures faster, friendlier, and less prone to inadvertent mistakes. \n This is possible by changing the contents of a text file.\n Click “Start Button” > Run \n Type: cmd \n \n Type: gpg --version \n Look for the output: Home: C:\... which is usually: \n C:\Users\$NAME\AppData\Roaming\gnupg \n C:\Documents and Settings\$NAME\Application Data\gnupg \n \n Append the following to the file gpg.conf located in the GPG Home Directory:personal-cipher-preferences AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 3DES \n personal-digest-preferences SHA512 \n cert-digest-algo SHA512 \n default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 BZIP2 ZLIB ZIP Uncompressed \n Note: If there is no file name gpg.conf in your GPG Home Directory, open a Text Editor such as Notepad and paste the above text. \n \n Save the text file in your GPG Home Directory as gpg.conf in order to use this text file as your GPG Configuration File. \n \n Thunderbird will be very helpful here. If you have never installed Thunderbird before, the first time you start Thunderbird you will see a large "Welcome to Thunderbird" screen that will guide you through this process. \n Alternatively, you can always select "Thunderbird > Local Folders" and click "Email" under "Create a new account" \n \n Select "Plain Text” \n \n Unselect "Compose Messages in HTML Format." \n \n Click Thunderbird > OpenPGP > Preferences. \n On the "Basic" tab, if you see (error) because Enigmail did not locate your gpg.exe file, click “Browse” and point Enigmail manually to the folder that holds gpg.exe (e.g., C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG\pub\). \n Click "Display Expert Settings" \n On the “Sending” tab, check all boxes. \n “Add my own key to the recipients list” is a must if you want to read any secure, encrypted email you send to anyone else. \n “Always confirm before sending” is a great idea for beginners! \n On the “Key Selection” tab, check “By rules and email addresses”, On the “Advanced” tab, check and uncheck the boxes as shown above. \n On the "Keyserver" tab, if blank, specify your keyserver as the following: \n hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net \n Other comma-separated keyservers are allowed. \n This will enable you to receive secure emails.\n o (Confirm that your USER-ID is correct) \n Note: you can change the expiration date of your GPG Keypair at ANY time, even after the Keypair has expired! \n Note: If you decide to publish your GPG Keypair to a keyserver at some point, this name and email will get copied to the keyserver and be searchable by anyone. \n \n You must generate a revocation certificate NOW (while you control your Keypair) in order to revoke your Keypair LATER (when you may not control your Keypair). \n This will help you avoid revoking the wrong Keypair in the future. \n \n Copy revoke.NAME-0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.asc to at least one backup location. \n No, not that Adele. Write your message to Adele the friendly OpenPGP email robot., Let’s get Adele’s Public Key and then send her a test message.\n Type adele@gnupp.de \n \n Select the Keypair “Adele (The friendly OpenPGP email robot) <adele-en@gnupp.de>" and click “OK.” \n \n Click “Thunderbird > Write” or \n click “Thunderbird > File > New > Message” or \n type “Ctrl + N” in order to open a new message composition window \n Write “adele-en@gnupp.de” in the To: field \n \n This message is ENCRYPTED. \n This message is DIGITALLY SIGNED. \n This message includes my PUBLIC KEY. \n Yours truly, NAME \n If you do not give others your Public Key, they cannot send you encrypted messages. \n Click “OpenPGP > Key Management” within the message composition window \n Select your Keypair and click “Edit > Copy Public Keys to Clipboard” and click "OK" \n Click on your message to Adele and paste (Ctrl + V) or (“Edit > Paste”) in order to include your Public Key in your message. \n \n Click "Send" \n You should see a new pinentry box by which gpg-agent is asking you for the passphrase needed to digitally sign the message. \n \n Hint: Your GPG passphrase is NOT your email password. \n \n You may be asked for your email account password in order to SEND email. \n Hint: This is NOT your GPG passphrase. \n \n Note the orange pencil icon in the lower-right and the red circle over the envelope in the upper-right indicate Adele did not digitally sign her message. \n 
 \n Windows 10: Click the start button, then the magnifying glass icon. Type paint, then select “Paint” when it appears in the search results. \n Windows 8: Swipe inward from the right side of the screen and select “Search.” Type paint. When “Paint” appears in the search results, click it. \n Windows Vista and 7: Click the Start button, then expand the “All Programs” group. Open the “Accessories” menu and select “Paint.”\n Paint can open up many different image types, including *.bmp, .gif, .jpg/.jpeg, .tif/.tiff, .ico, and .png. To open a file in Paint, click “File,” then “Open.” Navigate to the folder where your image file is stored and click “Open.” \n When Paint launches, you’ll see a white “canvas” appear on the screen. Imagine this canvas as a piece of paper for you to draw or write on. You can adjust the size of the canvas before you start creating your masterpiece. \n Windows 7 and later: On the Home tab, click “Resize.” Select “Pixels” and type the desired size in the “horizontal” and “vertical” boxes. Or, if you’d rather adjust the size by percentage, select “Percentage” and enter the percentage by which you’d like to increase or decrease the current canvas size. For example, if you’d like to make your image 50% of the size it is now, type 50 into each box. To double the current size, type 200 into each box. \n Vista: Click “Image” and select “Attributes.” Enter your desired canvas size (in pixels) in the Width and Height boxes. \n Click once at the top left corner of the part of the image you want to preserve, then drag the mouse down toward the right until the dotted box encloses just the part of the image you want. Let go of the mouse button, then click “Crop.” \n Click “Image,” then select “Resize/Skew” (if you’re using Windows 7 or later, just click “Resize” on the toolbar). Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+W to bring up the Resize/Skew dialog. Type a new size (in pixels, or by percent, as you did when creating the canvas) to increase or decrease the image size. \n To flip an image upside down (or some other direction), use the Flip and Rotate tools. \n Windows 7 and later: On the toolbar, click “Rotate” and choose a direction in the menu. \n Vista: In the “Image” menu, click “Flip/Rotate,” and select a direction to flip or rotate your image. \n You can also press Ctrl+R to bring up the Rotate tool on any platform. \n Click the magnifying glass icon to enable the Zoom tool. To zoom in, click anywhere on your image with the left mouse button. To zoom out, click with the right mouse button. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+⇞ PgUp to zoom in, and Ctrl+⇟ PgDn to zoom out. \n If you make a mistake using any of these tools, you can “undo” your action by pressing Ctrl+Z. \n You’ll also see the option to choose a file format. This depends based on what you plan to do with your picture. JPG is a good option for photographs or images with lots of colors. If you only use a few colors and not much detail, GIFs are versatile and have small file sizes. If you’re only planning to use this image in Paint, you can save it as a Bitmap (.bmp), which is the default file type. \n You can always convert your images to a different file format later. See How to Convert Pictures to JPEG or Other Picture File Extensions. \n The assortment of colored squares at the top of the screen is the color palette. Clicking a color will select that color as the foreground (main) color for any tool you use in Paint. You can also set a background color for when you start working with shapes. \n Windows 7 and later: The foreground is called “Color 1,” the background “Color 2.” To choose a foreground color, click “Color 1” and select any color from the palette. For a background color, click “Color 2” and click any color. \n Windows Vista or below: Find the two overlapping colored boxes to the left of the palette. The front box is the foreground color, the back box is the background. Set the background color by right-clicking the color of your choice. \n \n To draw a straight line, click the Straight Line tool, then choose a color from the palette. Click anywhere in your canvas. While holding down the mouse button, drag the mouse away from that first click in any direction. Release the button when the line is as long as you want it to be. \n For a curved line, click the Curve icon (a squiggly line). Draw a line as you would with the straight line tool. When you lift your finger from the mouse button, click somewhere on the line and drag it in any direction. The straight line you drew will curve in that direction. \n The width of the line can be adjusted by clicking the Size menu and selecting a different line width. To draw, simply press the mouse button as you move the mouse on the canvas. \n The Paintbrush is more versatile than the Pencil, as you can choose different brush “tips” for more unique lines. \n In Windows 7 and above, click the down-arrow beneath “Brushes” and choose one of the brush tips. You can adjust the size of each brush tip by clicking the “Size” icon. \n In Windows Vista and earlier, click the Paintbrush icon, then choose a brush tip shape from the menu that appears just below the toolbar. Select a color from the palette and drag the mouse to draw a design on the canvas. \n This tool works similarly to the Paintbrush tool, but the look is more in line with that of can of spray paint. \n Windows 7 and newer: this tool is located in the “Brushes” menu. \n Vista and earlier: Click the icon that looks like a can of spray paint. Draw as you would the pencil or brush tools. \n Like other tools, you can adjust the width of the eraser with the Size menu. \n Note that the background color (“Color 2” in Windows 7 and later) will appear wherever you use the eraser tool. If you’re erasing a red line on a white background, for example, make sure the background color is set to white. \n Select any shape from the toolbar to draw that shape. Once you’ve chosen a shape, you’ll notice some options for the shape’s appearance. \n In Windows 7 or above, click the “Outline” and “Fill” menus to view your (slightly more varied) options. If you’re using Windows Vista or an earlier version, you’ll see an outline of a shape, an outline of a shape around a filled-in color, and a solid-colored shape. \n Select your preferred outline and fill options, then click the canvas where you’d like to place your shape. Hold down the mouse button as you drag the cursor to enlarge the shape. Let go of the mouse button when you reach the desired shape size. \n If you chose a shape with an outline, the color of the outline will be the current foreground color. If your shape has a solid filling, the fill color will be the background color. \n Also known as the “Paint Bucket,” the Fill tool will paint an entire defined area with a single color. \n Click the icon that looks like a spilling paint bucket, then choose a color from the palette. Now, click the canvas to fill it with the color you selected. \n The Fill tool will fill the space between all closed lines. Try creating a square or circle with the shape tool in one color, then use the Fill tool to change the color of just that shape. \n There are two different tools you can use to select parts of your image: Freeform Select (a dotted outline of oval-ish shape) and Rectangular Select (a dotted outline of a rectangle). Freeform allows you to draw your own freehand selection line around an image, while the rectangular selection tool lets you draw a rectangle. \n In Windows 7 and later, click the arrow beneath “Select” and choose “Rectangular” or “Freeform.” In Windows Vista and earlier, you’ll see both on your toolbar. \n To use either tool, start by clicking at the top left corner of your image, then hold the mouse button as you trace your way around. The rectangular selection will be fairly quick, but you’ll need to be more deliberate to trace manually with the freeform tool. Let go of the mouse button when you’re done selecting. \n Copy the selected area by pressing Ctrl+C. Paste it somewhere else (in Paint or in other compatible programs, like Microsoft Word or Power Point) by clicking a new location and pressing Ctrl+V. \n If you don’t want the background color to be a part of your selection: \n Windows 7 and later: Check “Transparent Selection” in the Select menu. \n Windows Vista or earlier: Find the two icons that feature multicolored shapes with a “selection” rectangle on top. Click to highlight bottom (transparent) of the two icons. To disable this later, click back to the top selection icon. \n Select the Text tool, which is signified by the letter “A,” then double-click somewhere on the canvas to start typing. \n A dotted text box with square boxes on each corner will appear. Make sure the text in the text box is exactly the way you want it before switching to another tool (you’ll be unable to edit text after closing the text box. \n To increase the text box size (which will give you more room to type), hold the mouse over one of the square corners until the cursor turns to an arrow, then drag the box to a larger size. \n Choose a font face and size from the top of the screen and begin typing. To change the color, size or face of the text after you type, highlight the text, then choose the new color, size, etc. When you’re typing, click somewhere outside of the text box to leave the tool. \n You can distort an image with the “skew” feature. Click “Image,” then select “Resize/Skew” (if you’re using Windows 7 or later, just click “Resize” on the toolbar). To stretch/distort the image by degree, type a number (in degrees) in the boxes marked “horizontal” and “vertical. \n The small eyedropper icon represents the Color Picker tool. Click this tool, then click somewhere in your drawing. The area you click will now become the foreground color for your next tool of choice. \n You can edit any of the colors by adjusting their hue, brightness and other options in the Paint color mixer. Click “Edit colors” or “Define custom colors” to enter the color mixer. When you’ve decided on a color you like, click “Add to custom colors.” \n Drawing symmetrically isn’t easy when you’re using a mouse, so you may want to give yourself some guidelines. Click the “View” tab, then put a checkmark next to “Ruler” to see horizontal and vertical rulers around your canvas. Put a check next to “Gridlines” to create a grid on your canvas. You can turn either of these items off at any time by removing these checkmarks. \n Here are some of the more common ones: \n Rotate: Ctrl+R \n New Canvas: Ctrl+N \n Cut: Ctrl+X \n Paste: Ctrl+V \n Copy: Ctrl+C \n Save: Ctrl+S \n Delete: Del \n Print: Ctrl+P \n Undo: Ctrl+Z \n Highlight All: Ctrl+A \n Open: Ctrl+O \n Redo: Ctrl+Y \n Hide Toolbar: Ctrl+T \n Open Attributes: Ctrl+E \n Stretch And Skew: Ctrl+W \n Hide Color bar: Ctrl+L \n 
 They are self-serving, arrogant and a bit intimidating. They command people left and right, even when they are not in the position to be giving the orders. (See the Enemy Within, char: Charles Kawalsky)\n Be arrogant, but do not be a bastard. There is a difference. \n They are known for their elaborate clothing. Take a look at the clothing of people today if they go into battle. Tight, form fitting, usually pants. The Goa'uld (even the male personality ones) wear things like long dresses and loose clothing. They don't fight using strength and hand to hand combat because they have technology that allows them to pwn your face from afar. It's kind of ridiculous seeing that the symbiote gives the body increased strength and everything. \n They wore chain mail looking outfits showing no more than their hands and face. In the movie, Stargate, the guards wore schenti, sandals, a top (usually midriff bearing) and their totem masks. \n In today's world, that's your choice. Many people are starting to get interested in the older style of things, so you may not look too alienated if you went the elaborate clothing style versus the war mode style. \n They'd be very commanding and intimidating, blasting people around with their hand device and ribboning everyone into submission. \n This is the chainmail style that looks reminiscent of Ancient Egyptian style, but updated for the sci-fi look. \n They achieved the blend of sci-fi and Ancient Egyptian culture very well. I think it was probably the colors and the fact they wore actual loin cloths instead of a weird rigid schenti. \n Take an acting class to learn how to speak more fluidly and move in a controlled manner. Walk and talk slow as if the world needs to slow down and move at your pace. Learn to control conversations you enter into. Act mostly non-interested in other people and as if you have more important things to attend to. \n Acting like a Goa'uld can lead you to be loved by many people because if done correctly, you can come off very strong and sure of yourself rather than a tyrant and rude bastard. \n Apophis was not above making Sokar think he was all loyal and following of him. Therefore to be a Goa'uld you must be cunning and sneaky. Never let anyone in on your plans unless they have undying loyalty for you. Note: This can not be a person who is of very high self esteem or arrogant themselves, it may eventually lead into a battle of who is more powerful of the two of you, literally. Conceal your motives. \n Money is power in today's world. Money can earn you the loyalty and respect of people because they follow the person with the most paper in their pockets. These are the flunkies that eat out of every rich person's palm. Get wealthy and then protect your wealth. Invest and build a literal empire. \n So, do not neglect your followers. Goa'uld mostly played on their claim to divinity and using their technology to look Godlike. Unfortunately, this tech is not available to do that. So, do not treat your underlings like crap. That's why there are many revolts going along. Listen to your followers, do not allow them to get out of line, but listen to them. People will follow a reasonable ruler who is down their in the fray with them rather than a removed ruler who makes it appear as if they do not matter to them. \n Goa'uld are not real and neither is Stargate. Behaving too strictly to this list may earn you a beating from people who don't like your attitude. Don't pick up behaviors that you can't back up. \n 
 Every baby experiences diaper rash at one point or another. Over half of babies experience a diaper rash at least once every two months. Learn to recognize the most common symptoms of diaper rash so that you can begin to treat it immediately. Symptoms of diaper rash include: \n Bright pink or red skin around your baby's groin, thighs, and bottom \n Dry, inflamed skin around the diaper area \n Bumps or sores \n Your baby might also act fussier than usual when experiencing diaper rash\n Many diaper rashes can clear up on their own, as long as you use proper diapering techniques. You can avoid using diaper cream if you make sure your baby's diaper is changed frequently and that your baby's skin is clean and exposed to the open air. Proper diapering technique involves: \n Changing diapers frequently — about every two hours or so, and after every poopWashing your baby's bottom gently with warm water: do not rely solely on baby wipes to clean stool off of the skinOnly using a mild soap when cleaning stool off of the skin: do not use soap every time you wash your baby's bottomUsing baby wipes that are unscented and alcohol free \n Giving your baby a lot of naked time to allow the skin to dry and breathePatting your baby dry instead of rubbing (rubbing can irritate the skin)Fastening a new diaper only after your baby's skin is completely dry and has had some time to breathe \n Making sure the fresh diaper is loose, not tight, on your baby's skinWashing cloth diapers very thoroughly to prevent the spread of bacteria — a vinegar rinse can help kill rash-causing bacteriaWashing your hands thoroughly after every diaper change, Most babies do not require diaper cream at every diaper change. In many cases, diaper rash can be prevented by making sure that your baby's skin is dry, clean, has exposure to the open air, and does not come into contact with stool.However, all babies who wear diapers will experience a rash at some point. If your baby only experiences diaper rash occasionally, use the cream when you see symptoms of diaper rash begin to develop: you will not need to use it as a preventive measure. \n Some infants are especially susceptible to diaper rash. If your baby experiences consistent, ongoing diaper rashes despite your reasonable precautions and proper diapering technique, you can consider applying diaper cream at each diaper change. It is possible that your baby has sensitive skin and requires extra skin protection., Diaper cream is very useful when your baby is experiencing a bout of diarrhea. Diarrhea can make it difficult for you to change diapers frequently enough to prevent a diaper rash, and the consistency of diarrhea makes it more likely to cause widespread skin irritation on your baby's bottom.If your baby has diarrhea, apply diaper cream between changes as a preventive measure.If your baby has serious, ongoing diarrhea, talk to your pediatrician. You do not want your baby to become dehydrated. \n Certain kinds of diaper cream are very thick: this can help prevent irritation. Other kinds of diaper cream are thinner and drier: this can help provide increased airflow to the affected area. In order to determine what consistency is best for your baby, talk to your doctor. He or she should have some sage advice about whether your baby's rash will do best with a thick paste or a thinner cream., Diaper creams can be purchased at most drug stores and supermarkets. If you care for an infant, you should have a tube of diaper cream handy to help prevent and heal diaper rashes. Look for a diaper cream with ingredients such as zinc oxide, calendula, and aloe: these substances help to soothe and protect red and inflamed skin.Petroleum jelly and other mineral oils are also common, safe ingredients.If your child has any allergies or skin sensitivities, be sure you read the ingredients of the diaper cream carefully to ensure that it doesn't make the rash worse. For example, babies with a wool allergy should not be exposed to diaper creams made with lanolin. \n Most diaper creams are designed for use with disposable diapers. If you use cloth diapers, make sure that the diaper cream you purchase explicitly states that it is safe to use with cloth diapers.Only use creams that explicitly state that they are safe for infants. Stay away from adult-strength creams or any creams that contain boric acid, baking soda, camphor, benzocaine, diphenhydramine, or salicylates. These ingredients can be harmful to young children., Some babies are sensitive to certain common ingredients in diaper creams. If one kind of cream seems to irritate your baby's skin, try another brand with different ingredients. Use trial-and-error and careful observation to determine which kinds of cream are the best for your baby. \n This advice also applies to other substances your baby will encounter, such as laundry detergents, soaps, cleansers, and fabrics. If you are having trouble finding cleansers that do not irritate your baby's skin, try to find unscented, alcohol-free substances that are hypoallergenic. \n Even if you purchase a non-toxic diaper cream, it is not safe for your baby or toddler to ingest. Make sure that you store your diaper cream in a place where your baby cannot suck on it or grab it, such as a high shelf or a baby-proof drawer. Keep your tube of diaper cream sealed with a safety lid. \n The best time to apply diaper cream is during diaper changes. Parents of very young infants will have to change their diapers every two hours and after every poop. Slightly older infants and toddlers might require less frequent diaper changes, since they do not urinate as frequently. Especially if your child has diaper rash or sensitive skin, you have to make sure that poopy diapers are changed as soon as possible: stool is the worst culprit of diaper rashes and skin irritation.If you baby has a rash, check your baby's diaper every hour during the day and once during the night to make sure it isn't dirty., It will be easier for you and safer for your baby if all of your supplies are within easy reach. Having your supplies close to hand means that you are less likely to have to leave your baby unattended during a diaper change. The supplies you need include: \n A clean diaper \n A towel or changing mat \n Diaper cream \n Warm water, or unscented, alcohol free baby wipes \n Soft towels or washcloths \n A waterproof bag or wastebasket for the soiled diaper \n Do not leave your baby unattended on any high surface. If your baby has diaper rash, it might be best to change your baby on a towel on the floor. That will make it easier for your baby to have some naked time later on. \n If you use a surface above the floor, such as a changing table, ensure you buckle the child safely onto the table or mat. \n Take off any shoes or pants, and unsnap any body suits. Pull shirts up and out of the diaper area. You want to keep the area totally clear: this will help prevent your baby's clothes from becoming soiled. Diaper creams may stain, and removing clothing will help prevent unnecessary staining as well. \n Unfasten the pins of cloth diapers or the tabs of disposable diapers. Open the soiled diaper and pull it down and out from under your child. Hold on to the baby's legs to prevent them from accidentally kicking into a soiled diaper. You want your baby to remain as clean and bacteria-free as possible., A baby with a diaper rash will have very raw, sensitive skin. However, it is necessary to clean this skin thoroughly to make sure that she can heal properly. It is also necessary for you to clean away any old or stiff diaper cream from the last time you applied. Do not use scented or alcoholic baby wipes. Warm water is the best way to clean a baby with diaper rash. You can use a mild, scent-free soap if your baby had a particularly messy bowel movement.Use a squirt bottle filled with warm water to clean your baby. This helps prevent irritation from scrubbing or rubbing. You can also soak your baby's bottom in a tub of warm water for a few minutes. This will help soothe her bottom as well as cleanse it properly.Make sure that all urine, stool, and residue from earlier applications of diaper cream are removed. \n If you have to use a cloth to finish removing traces of stool from your baby, be sure that you use a soft cloth, that you are very gentle, and that you rub front to back: never clean a baby from back to front., Using a very soft towel, pat your baby dry with a gentle blotting motion. Do not rub or scrub: this can irritate the skin further. Moisture helps to feed the bacteria that cause diaper rash, so your baby must be as dry as possible. \n Keep the child's bottom exposed to the air for as long as possible. Exposing your baby to the air is one of the best ways to prevent and heal diaper rash. Her skin will be able to dry and breathe, and the air discourages the growth of bacteria and fungus. If possible, give your baby at least 10 minutes of naked time during each diaper change., Get the new diaper ready to fasten beneath your baby's bottom and legs. Lift up his legs and slide the clean diaper underneath. Position the tabs at the back so that they are at the same level as the belly button.When your baby is experiencing serious diaper rash, you might want to consider going up a size in diaper for the next few days. A loose diaper will help encourage airflow and healing, and will prevent a buildup of moisture., You can choose to use a glove or a clean tissue if you wish. Spread the cream onto any inflamed areas and in the immediately surrounding skin. Pay particular care to apply the cream around the anus, genital area, and folds of skin around the thighs. Feel free to apply as much cream as necessary to cover the skin beneath a diaper. The cream should create a nice thick layer to protect the rash from moisture. Just as with cleaning your baby, try to apply the cream using front-to-back motions instead of back-to-front motions: this will help prevent uterine tract infections in your baby. \n Try to avoid touching raw or inflamed skin too often: simply dab it on and avoid rubbing or touching it further. \n Some diaper creams have a nozzle that will allow you to squeeze the cream directly onto your baby. This can be especially useful if your baby has particularly raw or sensitive skin that you do not want to irritate by touching directly. \n If your doctor has given you prescription medication, be sure to follow her instructions. There are some ointments that are designed to work alongside over-the-counter diaper creams, while other ointments replace over-the-counter diaper creams. Ask your doctor how a prescription cream and diaper cream might work together., Some diaper creams are quite sticky, which can cause a baby's diaper to stick to her skin. This might cause further irritation. To help decrease this stickiness and to encourage proper airflow, consider adding a layer of petroleum jelly. A small coating of petroleum jelly on top of the diaper cream will keep your baby's diaper fitting loosely and flexibly, which will encourage healing.You may even choose to use petroleum jelly as the diaper cream in some cases. \n Pull the front of the clean diaper up and even with the back. Fasten tabs at a comfortable yet secure tightness. You want the diaper to be a bit looser than normal to help encourage healing and to prevent chafing. \n Once your baby has been cleaned, changed, and has fresh diaper cream, you can dress him in whichever clothing you like. It is good to give your baby as much naked time as possible, however — aim for at least 30 minutes a day of naked time. \n If your baby soiled his clothing, be sure that you give him brand-new clothes. You do not want bacteria to spread and worsen the diaper rash. \n Because diaper rashes are caused in part by the spread of bacteria, you have to make sure that everything is clean after the diaper change. Your baby's clothing, the changing table, your baby's hands and feet, and your own hands all have to be thoroughly washed if they came into contact with your baby's stool or urine. Use warm water and soap to wash your hands (and your baby's hands, if necessary). Dispose properly of any soiled items, and place soiled cloths in the laundry to be washed. \n A regular diaper rash should be gone within three days of treatment.However, sometimes skin infections, fungal infections, or allergic reactions can look similar to diaper rash: these conditions will require different medication and more time to treat. If your diaper cream is not relieving your infant's symptoms, talk to a pediatrician. You might need to switch diaper creams, perform an allergy test, or get a prescription-strength medication to resolve the issue.If you notice any abnormal symptoms--such as fever, pus, or open sores--talk to a pediatrician immediately.
 If the online ticket purchase gives you the option to print out your boarding pass, this is recommended, especially if you are not checking bags.\n Make your bag identifiable by tying a ribbon on it or putting a tag on it, or use a colorful/unique bag. \n When you pack any liquid items on your carry-on, such as lotion, shampoo, body oils, etc. Make sure they are 3 oz. or less. Keep them together in a plastic Ziploc bag. Remember the rule 3-1-1, containers must be 3.4 ounces or less, stored in a 1 quart/liter zip-top bag and only 1 zip-top bag per person. \n This is in case of delays getting to the airport, checking in, or clearing security. \n Get in line and wait until you are asked to come forward. There is usually a bin that allows you to see if your luggage is small enough to go on the plane or if you have to check it. Also, keep in mind you may only have one piece of luggage and one smaller carry-on item. Have your ID on hand. \n If your luggage to check, place it on the nook in the counter when asked to. The agent will tag it, and either will place it on the conveyor belt behind the counter, or tell you to carry it over to a scanner. If not, tell her you have nothing to check. In either case, she will then hand you your boarding pass unless you printed it online. If you do not have bags to check and checked in online, you can skip this step entirely. \n You will meet a security worker who will check your boarding pass and ID and send you forward (make sure you have a proper ID this varies depending on your state). \n You will then wait in line to get to an x-ray machine and metal detector. You will put all of your bags, metallic objects and shoes on the conveyor belt to be scanned. If you have a Ziploc bag of liquids in your bag, remove it to be screened on its own. If you have any objects that would show up on the x-ray as a box, such as a laptop, tablet or video game system, remove it and send it through separately. Take off any jackets or sweatshirts, as those need to be screened as well. \n Remove all metal objects, including keys, jewelry, belts, etc. Then, remove your shoes and place them on the belt. If you get confused just ask a security worker politely. \n Replace anything you may have removed from your bag, put your shoes on and leave the security checkpoint. \n Gate numbers are indicators of areas where you will board the plane. The airline agent may have told you your gate number, it might be on your boarding pass, or you can find departure monitors in the area which will have a list of flights and gate numbers. Find your gate, which will be indicated by signs with numbers on them. These are very visible so do not worry. \n Make sure you bring 2 portable chargers that are fully charged because your flight can be delayed by as much as a few hours and in larger airport's wall outlets are taken up fast. \n As you approach the Jetway, you will hand them your boarding pass. It will be scanned and returned to you. Sometimes, the gate agent may tear off and keep a portion of it. \n If you have a smaller bag you'd like to hold onto, simply slide it under the seat in front of you so the area around your feet is clear. \n

 Plan to have family worship, sing spiritual songs and have quiet time with Christ together, worshiping God and developing your walk in Christ. Be sure to study the Bible and to praise God for your opportunities and for giving you your very life. Have a personal relationship with Jesus. Anything that goes wrong pray to Him and lean not on your own understanding. Proverbs 3:5\n is based upon loving "Jesus", "Others" and then lastly, "Yourself"-"but not least," as the Bible says you are "to love others 'as you love yourself'." So love yourself as much as you love others and then you have the winning concept straight from Christ! This, for example, also means do not try to directly control your husband or other people (try gentle persuasion). J.O.Y. also means that you should not judge wrongly or harshly, but you will forgive yourself and others. \n The Bible says: "Stay in a habit of attending church regularly" with your husband or alone (or with girlfriends), if necessary. "Pray for each other." Pray together and "pray without ceasing" and "honor Christ in all you do and say"... Our physical lives are in Christ and spiritually "His life on this earth is in us and we are in Him." He is "at the right hand of the Father in Heaven where He is always interceding for us." (Romans 8:34) \n Criticizing and putting yourself down to your husband or in front of him in public is a way of insulting his taste in women. Realize that if he is with you, it's because he chose you and wants to be with you. He finds you sexy enough, even if you don't feel like you are; so be there for him. Remember that attitude and willingness are important parts of feeling and being sexy. Poor self-esteem leaves a hole in your life that is terrible for your marriage. Make sure you continue to actually have occasional fun and help each other have an interesting life together, not just trying to control each other or only teasing about fun. Tease nicely, and mean it. Have a sense of humor. \n Will you still have girlfriends you see at least once a week, your special church group that you go to, full days and busy evenings? If you were not whole, your husband would always have to be trying to fill a hole in your life. Well, it's one that he won't ever fill, and you might both feel inadequate and unhappy, if you can't keep yourself up with friends and family as well as busy cheerfully serving Christ. \n Except in case your husband reads minds, don't expect your husband to just know what you want. If you want or need something, ask and discuss it together. Don't just drop hints and figure that he'll get it and "come around" without communicating calmly, clearly and directly. If something is wrong for you, say so. Christian friendships and relationships work best when each partner calmly expresses their current emotion -- without harping on what the other did. Frequently, a "I feel confused", or "I feel sad" is all it takes for him to step back and ask, "Why?" Then simply say, "When you slammed the door, I felt ignored (or insulted)." Let "I feel..." be your key word. Avoid saying "you"--as in "you made me sad." Say "'That' made me feel sad." Take responsibility for your own needs and feelings. \n He needs to keep trying to do well, and you need to keep trying also, but neither of you will ever be perfect. Unsatisfied expectations frustrate everyone. However, if you both continue to work on your marriage, you will always be involved in each others lives, even when one of you comes up a little short. If your expectations are truly too high, very idealistic or unrealistic, you should set standards that are obtainable. For example, it is unfair to expect to be lavished with possessions. Have the love of your life at home; staying home, try having home cooking at several meals per week versus going out to eat junk food instead. \n Also, should you want more together time, be prepared to have that desire fulfilled with some effort, washing clothes and cleaning house together and relaxing together. \n Nagging and nitpicking can destroy a relationship. As long as the dishes get clean and are unbroken, for instance: don't nag about how you want the dishwasher loaded--the "the right way". Let him do such things his own way. Don't sweat the small stuff. Focus on what is more important and don't be a complainer. Maybe explain the theory as you show him how you believe it needs to be done one time and then leave it alone."Wives, place yourselves under your husbands' authority as you have placed yourselves under the Lord's authority."(Ephesians 5:22) but only so far as he is not doing crimes, is not cruel or actually abusive (not the blame game...) to you, the children or other persons. \n (Ephesians 5:25) If your husband is not showing love, do not demand attention or affection. Just ask cheerfully for some help and pick a time to give a playful or sexy hug and kiss: he may respond well, if he's not angry--or unless it is not the right place and time. \n This affection and fun will carry over to when you have the chance and the time in private. \n Be willing to try some innocent, new things (or even suggest/approach it affectionately without asking) and discuss them - don't just turn down fun and harmless play when he suggests something you don't feel is appealing immediately. This may make him feel rejected or that you are not having fun. At least be willing to discuss it nicely, and perhaps try it, but never do anything you are uncomfortable with after discussing it with him. Also, don't be afraid to discuss anything you might be interested in. Physical intimacy is as important to a marriage as is "emotional intimacy". Nurture them both."Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control." (1 Corinthians 7:5) \n Accept him as he is, so that you have such deep respect and gratitude for him that you would never want him to change for you. He has so much to offer you, if you give him the space to be himself. He is a growing individual, just like you are. Help him grow in the direction that he chooses, and give him the chance to help you similarly. \n "And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with vanity about her hair and gold or jewels or expensive clothing;" (1 Timothy 2:9) Encourage your husband to expect you to be modest in public and erotic in private with him. There is much temptation that results from women feeling as if they need to turn other men on and to show their sensual side in public. One thing may lead to another. Avoid immodesty. \n Your spouse is not perfect and he will at times upset you, or even hurt your feelings. When this happens you have a choice to make; you either harbor offense and let your heart become hardened, or you can remember how patient and forgiving God is with you and forgive your husband just as you have been forgiven by The Lord. \n Quick to repent. Just as your husband is not perfect neither are you. The Bible says that "God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble" (James 4:6) It is so important in your relationship with your husband and with God that you be willing to humble yourself and ask for forgiveness when you are wrong, or have acted in an unloving way. \n Quick to believe. 1 Corinthians 13:7 says, "it (love) always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres." \n Don't simply focus on the bad about your husband, but see him the way God sees him; focus on the attributes that you love about him and always believe and compliment him, such as: "Honey, God is working in your heart, and so you are becoming more like Christ everyday." The trick is to believe this even when it doesn't look like it! That is real faith in action, believing God can bring it to reality even when you don't see it. \n

 Although your child may not become a proficient swimmer until he's a few years old, you can start bringing him in the pool at a few months. From 6 to 12 months is usually considered a good time to introduce your child to the water because at this age children will absorb the skill faster. As long as you're gentle with your child and introduce him to the water gradually, you can begin as early as 6 months., Make sure your child, whatever his age, is healthy enough to begin swimming. If your child has any health conditions you should consult your doctor before beginning swimming lessons., If you have a young child just learning how to swim, you should be familiar with basic first aid. Knowing CPR can save your child's life., If your child is still in diapers, use a waterproof swim diaper to prevent any leaks and protect the health of other swimmers., Blow-up devices like water wings are popular, but not recommended by pediatricians. If these spring a leak while your child is swimming, he can sink. These devices can also slip off.Instead, use a U.S. Coast Guard-approved life vest. These should be available at most sporting goods and pool equipment stores. \n When buying a life vest, look for the U.S. Coast Guard-approved label. For small children, the vest should have straps that hook under the legs to keep it from slipping over the child's head., If you have a pool, make sure your child can't get to it. Learning how to swim may make your child overconfident of his abilities and he might try to swim when you're not looking. Avoid accidents by completely blocking access to the pool when it's not in use. \n Infants require warm water, ideally between 85 and 92 degrees.If your pool isn't heated, you can try using a solar cover, which absorbs heat from the sun, to warm the pool. \n You should introduce your child to the water gradually. Many people, adults and children, drown because they panic in the water. By slowly exposing your child to the water, you're helping him overcome that fear. This will help him stay calm when learning more advanced swimming skills., An enjoyable first time in the water will teach your child the joy of swimming. Play together with toys, teach him to splash, sing songs, and be attentive to make sure he is enjoying himself., Lock his arms around your neck while he's facing you and start walking slowly backwards. \n With some practice, your child will learn to start kicking in the water by himself., He can best learn his own sense of buoyancy by remaining still in the water on his back, but at this stage he is sure to need your support.The most important part of learning this skill is getting him to relax., Carefully holding your child around the belly and being certain to keep his head above the water, you can both pretend he is a superhero flying. \n Seeing that you can float will reassure your child it is possible. You should take a moment to describe that different parts of the body float better than others. Deeper breaths will make the lungs more buoyant, and the lower body usually sinks., Now that your child understands a little bit more about floating, have him get a sense for the buoyancy of other objects. Have your child push toys and other floating objects under the water and laugh with him as he makes bubbles and splashes. \n Children are often uncomfortable with the sensation of the unsupported feeling of the back-float in water. A common reflex is to lift the head and bend at the waist, which will cause your child to sink., By resting your child’s head on your shoulder and holding him carefully, you can practice floating together. Sing a relaxing song together can have a calming effect in addition to other positive benefits of being skin to skin with your child., He should be in front of you in case he panics. Count down from three, exhaling lightly to blow on his face on the count of one. This will serve as a signal to your child that you are about to turn him on his back and will help prevent panic. \n Use your non-dominant hand to support his head, keeping it above water. Use the other to touch him in a reassuring way and offer support as necessary. He may squirm when placed in this position. Keep supporting him until he settles down. \n When he calms, little by little stop supporting his body while still holding his head. Allow him to float. \n If you are emotional, it might appear you are validating your child’s panic response. Use positive affirmations to restore clarity, saying things like, “It’s OK. I’m here. You have nothing to worry about.” Smile and laugh to show him everything is alright. \n This will familiarize him with being underwater and diminish his fear of it., Count to three and gently submerge his head. Bring it back up immediately. \n Use smooth motions. Jerky motions can hurt your child's neck. \n Allow your child to rest before doing this again. \n If you are clearly nervous or scared, your child will believe the water is something to fear. At this stage, you want to stay positive and show him that he doesn't have to be afraid of the water., At this early age, your child can't swim independently. You should always be in the pool with him at this stage. \n You can do this in the same fashion described for children under two. Help him overcome his initial fear and get him comfortable in the water. Once he is at ease, you can move on to some more advanced lessons. \n At this age, your child should be able to understand what is and isn't allowed in the pool. Generally accepted pool rules include:No running \n No horse-play \n No diving \n Swim with a buddy \n Stay away from drain covers and filters \n Most drowning cases under five result from inadequate supervision., At this age, your child can understand descriptions of swimming activities. If he is ready for something new, he is more likely to absorb the lesson if he is given brief instruction ahead of time.Show the motions for swimming activities outside the water before getting in. You might want to address new sensations, like the sense of buoyancy that can be felt in the chest when floating, pressure in the ears, or the muffled quality of sound beneath the water. \n Have your child submerge just his lips in the water and blow bubbles. This will help him with breath control and help prevent swallowing water as he starts learning to go underwater.If your child is hesitant, demonstrate this first. When you take your mouth out of the water, make sure you have a smile on your face. This will help show your child that there is nothing to be afraid of. \n Tell your child to talk to the fish, make a noise like a tractor, or blow as many bubbles as he can in the water. This makes the lesson fun while you teach your child a valuable swimming skill., Stand facing your child. Hold his arms out in front of him. Then start walking backwards, having your child kick his feet as you move. Verbal cues like "kick, kick, kick, kick" can help your child remember this motion., This is a simplified, arms-only version of the freestyle, which is where you paddle with your arms while kicking with your legs. Have your child start by sitting on a pool step or ladder so the water is roughly up to his chest. \n He should extend one arm straight out of the water and bring it above his head. \n He should bring it back to the water in a downward slapping motion, making sure he keeps his fingers together as he drives his hand into and through the water. \n Repeat this motion with the other arm. Direct him to use his arms like he would if he were really swimming. \n Make sure he keeps his fingers together, so the fish don't escape., Standing a few feet into open water, hold your child with one hand on his chest and one around his waist. Count to three and glide him through the water towards the steps or ladder. \n While doing this, have him combine blowing bubbles, kicking his legs, and swimming with his arms. This will help him start using all the motions necessary for independent swimming., Holding onto the wall is a good way for him to make his way back to the shallows and also helps teach him to maneuver on his own. It shows him a safe place he can use to stay afloat if he falls in the water, gets tired, or is scared., Instead of just dipping his head under, you can now try to keep him under for a few seconds. This will teach him to hold his breath underwater. Make sure you tell him to close his eyes and mouth and hold his breath. \n Remember to explain what you're about to do to avoid scaring your child. \n Never put your child underwater unexpectedly. This will scare him and could make him afraid of the water. \n After two or three seconds, bring him back up. You can increase this gradually as your child gets accustomed to it.If he seems hesitant, try counting to two or three to show him that he'll only be under the water for a very short time. \n It may make your child more comfortable if you go under first. Remember to smile and laugh when you come back up so he knows there's nothing to be afraid of. \n At this point, he has all the basic skills needed to start swimming, he just needs practice putting it all together. A life vest will allow him the freedom he needs to start combining all these techniques and swimming on his own. \n Remember that even if your child is capable of swimming without you holding him, he should still never be left alone. \n If he is comfortable in the water and is able to swim at or beyond the level described for 2 – 4 year olds, then you can move on to more advanced swimming techniques. \n This is a fun and simple swimming style that is often used by young children learning to swim.The ideal water level for the Dog Paddle is about chest high. \n Making downward scooping motions with his fingers together, he should “dig” through the water while kicking his feet, much like a dog or a horse might swim. \n Have fun while learning the Dog Paddle by searching for videos of dogs swimming online. \n Chances are he will try to fully extend his legs, but short, fast kicks offer more power. To improve form, have him point his toes while kicking., He might need support while learning to coordinate his arms and legs, but as he gains confidence you should supervise independent swimming. \n To properly swim with both hands, your child will not be able to plug his nose while swimming. Start with a game to see who can make the most bubbles using only air blown out the nose! \n In the beginning, your child might blow out all his air in one burst out of fear the water will rush up his nose. Stay close in case he accidentally takes on some water and needs your support. \n In the event he has the unpleasant experience of getting water up his nose, respond appropriately. Give him warm encouragement by saying things like, “That happens sometimes. It’s OK!” \n At this point, your child might not be the most coordinated underwater, but allow him to get a feel for moving around underwater without plugging his nose. This will make it easier for him to transition to swimming a proper stroke. \n You should approach this exercise with patience, as this is a complicated technique that may take some time., He should be about waist or chest deep in the water. Be aware that your child might have eyes that are sensitive to chlorine. \n Practice in the shallow end and allow him to feel how his arms and legs sync up without submerging his head. Regularly, have him turn his head to practice the motion of turning out of the water to breathe. He should alternate the side he turns every third stroke. \n Do this by counting his strokes and having him turn his head and take a deep breath with the third stroke. Alternating sides will keep his form symmetrical., Have him dip his face in the water and practice swimming two strokes, turning his head for a breath on every third stroke. With each breath, he should alternate sides. \n Once he is comfortable, he can graduate to swimming with a life vest and, after mastering that, he can begin supervised swimming on his own. \n When he is experienced enough, you can try this without a life vest. If not, it is fine to start with a life vest on., When he stops moving from the push, he should start kicking and stroking with his arms until he reaches the other side. \n Make sure you follow closely, especially if he isn't wearing a life vest. \n This will help if your child falls in onto his back., Tell him to drop one of his shoulders towards the bottom of the pool. He should roll the rest of his body to follow the motion of that shoulder. \n When he rotates onto his stomach, have him swim to the side of the pool. \n Treading water is an important skill in case your child needs to stay afloat in the water for a long period of time. It will keep him upright in the water and able to interact with toys and friends while floating., Do this by having him jump off the ladder towards the center of the pool. Once in the water, he should immediately turn around and swim back to the ladder. This basic technique could save your child's life., This will teach him that it is only acceptable to jump to the middle, where it's safest, and not to the sides, where he could get hurt. \n Now that your child is more experienced, he can start learning some real swim strokes. The following are some of the most common swimming strokes your child can learn. \n Freestyle: Do Three Basic Strokes while Swimming \n Breaststroke: Swim Breaststroke Efficiently \n Backstroke: Do Three Basic Strokes while Swimming \n Sidestroke: Swim the Sidestroke \n

 Sikhs have an obligation to pray daily, work hard, and share with those in need.\n Sikhs are the students of their ten teachers (or Guru's) who compiled their teachings into a unique collection of divine scriptures, called the Guru Granth Sahib. \n The Guru Granth Sahib is considered a Living Guru \n However outside India attending a Gurdwara might be more difficult, if you live in a large city. If you live near a Gurdwara visit the local Granthi/Sikh custodian who can provide more information on the Sikh path. \n Some Sikhs are vegetarian because they have a great respect for animals, however Sikhs are not bound to be vegetarianism according to the Sikh Code of Conduct. The Sikh Code of Conduct states that ritually slaughtered meat or Kosher/Halal is forbidden. When Sikhs attend a Gurdwara only vegetarian food is served. Whether a Sikh is vegetarian can also depend upon what traditions or region he or she are from. \n Akal is only realised through self knowledge, Sikhs therefore place emphasis on meditation to understand Akal. Sikhs aim to become one with Akal in order to end the cycle of birth and death, while not withdrawing from society. \n Sikhs also meditate for the purpose of realizing truth, as Akal (timeless spirit) is truth and truth is Akal and as Sikhs know Akal through meditation so they know truth through meditation, Guru Nanak said truth is only attainable through self realisation. Self realisation thus leads to enlightenment and ends the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. \n Sikhs believe these five distractions prevent one from achieving union with God which is the ultimate goal. If you are to lead a good life free from suffering you must avoid the five distractions. \n He stated that rite, pilgrimages and asceticism and fasting are meaningless, devotion should come inwardly. Sikhs therefore should try to balance work,charity and worship.Sikhs have an optimistic view of life, a spirit of chardi kala. They also believe that they should defend and protect the rights of others. They should never endorse a class system, sexism, racism, or other stereotypes that support inequality \n Charity is very important to Sikhs who balance charity along with work and worship. Charity is part of the Sikh belief in defending others and that can also mean defending others from poverty. \n The part of the Guru Granth Sahib depends on the activity and is supposed to strengthen faith. \n Here are some Sikh festivals taken from Wikipedia, though there are more. \n Gurpurab are celebrations or commemorations based on the lives of the Sikh Gurus. They tend to be either birthdays or celebrations of Sikh martyrdom. All ten Gurus have Gurpurabs on the Nanakshahi calendar, but it is Guru Nanak Dev and Guru Gobind Singh who have a gurpurab that is widely celebrated in Gurdwaras and Sikh homes. The martyrdoms are also known as a shaheedi Gurpurab, which mark the martyrdom anniversary of Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Tegh Bahadur. \n Vaisakhi or Baisakhi normally occurs on 13 April and marks rebirth, the beginning of the new spring year and the end of the harvest. Sikhs celebrate it because on Vaisakhi in 1699, the tenth guru, Gobind Singh, laid down the Foundation of the Khalsa an Independent Sikh Identity. \n Bandi Chhor Divas or Diwali celebrates Guru Hargobind's release from the Gwalior Fort, with 52 innocent Hindu kings who were also imprisoned by Jahangir, on 26 October 1619. \n Hola Mohalla occurs the day after Holi and is when the Khalsa Panth gather at Anandpur Sahib and display their warrior skills, including fighting and riding. \n Names of the morning and evening prayers are below. \n Morning prayers include: Japji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, Tav Prasaad Svaiye, Chaupai Sahib, Anand Sahib \n Evening prayer:Rehras Sahib \n Bedtime prayer:Kirtan Sohila \n Here is a link to recordings of prayers: http://sgpc.net/live-kirtan-sri-harmandir-sahib-96-kbps/ \n When a Sikh takes Amrit he/she becomes pure or Khalsa. Khalsa members adhere to the five K's. \n 
\n Use a horse brush in the summer-time. Use curry comb or shedding blade if it is spring-time. Consider skipping horse baths in the fall or winter. \n Clean out your horse's nose and wipe out the eyes. \n If your horse is a he, then get out a clean sponge that has never been used on any horse's face and clean under his tail where a girl horse's dock is normally. \n Clean the underside of your girl horse (mare). This means touching the udder and teats (areas that have no hair) and are prone to collecting dust and sweat. When mixed with dead skin, this makes a really gross, disgusting goo that must be removed to prevent irritation to the horse. The first time is the worst - once the area is clean, it will be much easier to clean later. If she's never been cleaned, the goo will dry and you will be pealing it off. The horse will appreciate your soothing voice as you do this unpleasant chore. \n You may use the sponge used for the rear end when washing the tail. Do not use the sponge for the head when washing the tail. \n Be very careful not to dig at the frog as it is soft and tender. The frog is located at the rear of the hoof. \n
 To begin your hydroponic gardening project you will only need a few things to get you off to a great start. Many of the items you need for hydroponics can already be found around your house so you can save money before you go full tilt into this hobby or found all together in a hydroponic garden.\n Most newbie gardeners can either purchase an easy to install grow room or build a greenhouse outside of their home. Small grow rooms for the beginning hydroponic gardener are usually slightly larger than a closet and can be completely installed in under an hour. The cost ranges from several hundred dollars to over $500, depending on the add-ons that you think you will need. \n A small greenhouse can cost considerably more because you will need to either include a cement floor and drainage system or lay other types of flooring such as gravel before you build the greenhouse itself. Many small greenhouses cost anywhere from $500 to over several thousand dollars, depending on the add-ons you choose. \n The basic items you need after you decide on either a grow room or greenhouse include a temperature control unit, exhaust fan, heating mats, light fixtures for your blue and red spectrum lights, an aeration system (an aquarium system works well for small gardens), pearlite, marble and Styrofoam work well as a beginning medium and rockwool, oasis or Rapid Rooters. Typical beginning tables for your plants include plastic tubs, a child’s swimming pool or fish tank. A gardener can also buy any of the items they need for their grow room from stores specializing in hydroponic supplies. \n Make sure that it can be grown where you live (don't choose a citrus plant if you're living in Alaska, for instance) and that it isn't a plant that is grown underground. \n Fold it over, and place it gently in a clear, sealable bag. \n Germination is triggered when a seed is wet, so keep the paper towels moist. Don't forget that some seeds take longer than others. \n What you do next depends on the type of plant. \n If the seed has a frailer stem, keep it in the original paper towel but cut small holes for the leaves to emerge through. \n If the seed has a stronger stem, feel free to cover only the roots in wet paper towels and let the stem straighten out and grow leaves. \n This is a very fragile time in their life, so be extremely gentle. \n You can choose between having one plant per container, or doing a larger container with many plants. If you choose the second option, make sure that all the plants have good support. \n If you are growing a plant that gets much taller, you should probably tape a support to the side of the container. \n Also, plants need nutrients to grow, so buy a pack of liquid fertilizer to add to the water every week. Follow the package instructions, and don't overfeed the plants. \n They will open and dry up, leaving behind the start of a fruit or vegetable. \n If the plant needs cross-pollination in order to be fertilized, place the plant outside or near an open window for a few days so that insects can do the job. A good plant for hydroponic gardening is one that self pollinates. \n Normally, plants can anchor themselves into the dirt for extra support. Check your plant's stem daily for any cracks or bending points. \n Enjoy your hydroponic garden! \n

 Loop the yarn around the pointer and middle fingers of your left hand. Stick your hook through the circle, hooking the working end of your yarn with the hook and then pulling it back through the center of the circle. This will give you one loop on your crochet hook. \n This will form the very center of the circle you are crocheting. \n If you are following a pattern you may need to make a different number of chains to start. This will change the number of stitches you make in further steps but will not change the general technique. \n Insert the hook into the loop of the first chain you made. Once through, hook the working end of the yarn onto the hook and then pull it back through the loop and also through the loop that was on your hook.Now the piece is formed into a circle and you have one loop on your hook. \n Be sure that you are going through the very center and not one of the stitches you made. \n To "yarn over" means that you need to hook the working end of your yarn onto your hook. Then twist your hook slightly, so that the yarn stays hooked on. \n Two loops should be on the hook after you complete this step. \n This is the finishing step of the basic stitch called a "Single Crochet". \n In all you will make eight single crochet stitches around forming a tiny circle for the beginning of your project. \n This will be the first step in creating a connection between the end of the last round to the beginning of it and setting the stage to start another. \n Two loops should now be on the hook. \n This the finishing step of the single crochet stitch which joins everything into a circle. This stitch is also the first single crochet of the next round. (Stitch 1 of 16 total.) \n Now continue around the circle by making two single crochet stitches in each single crochet stitch of the first ring. Doing this is called an "increase". This means that there will be 16 stitches when you complete the round. Please count them. \n Doing two stitches in each one stitch from the previous round is how we "increase" the size of the circle we are making. \n However, this time you will put only one single crochet in the first stitch but then put two single crochet stitches in the next stitch. Do this "increase" in every other stitch of the previous round.Repeat this to the end of the round. \n Make one single crochet in the first stitch, then make two single crochets in the next stitch. On the next round do two stitches in every third stitch, then two stitches in every fourth stitch and so on. \n See a pattern developing? To keep increasing, put two stitches in the n-th stitch where n is the number of the round you're currently working on. For instance, if you are working on the fourth round, put two stitches in every fourth stitch as you work your way around. You may loop a shot piece of contrasting colored yarn through each round if you wish, to help know which row you are on. \n This is called "Tie-ing off the end". Once the yarn is tied off, sew or "weave" in the ends. Some patterns use the word "weave". To sew or weave in the ends, use a Yarn Needle. Fold the yarn end over the Yarn Needle forming a small tight loop. Slide the yarn needle out of the loop, then insert this tight loop into the eye of the Yarn Needle. Push it through far enough that you can grasp the loop and pull the yarn all the way through the eye. Gently weave the needle tip under and over stitches on the back of your work where it will not show. Do this for a distance of 7 to 8 stitches. Now turn around and alternate. Go over the stitches you previously went under and visa-versa. Now turn it around and do it a third time, this will make the "tail" or "yarn-end" stay put for many years. Remember to sew in both "tails" on the outside edge and in the very center. \n 
 This will affect their balance because they will have to lower themselves to the same height or close to it which takes away the height advantage. Also they will have an inclination to lean forward. This will leave them open to uppercuts and affect their overall balance.\n Both parties are likely to be injured and it is not a good way to act, so finding a way not to fight is the best way. Talking is a better way out or making distance or space so it is harder for them to attack you is always better than using your fists. \n You will need to have learned this in a class and have spent a lot of time doing it till you feel and understand that fighting someone bigger, smaller or taller doesn't matter; it is all just fear of being hurt or killed and this is normal. \n Most taller fighters are unable to really "fight tall", or truly take advantage of their height. Scan your opponent's face and eyes. Look at their stance (foot position), body language and distance away from you. Is your opponent nervous? Angry? If you move in aggressively does the opponent instinctively shift or move back and keep distance? If not they are probably unaware of how to use their height. You can use this to give yourself a chance to take them by surprise. \n You must motion to the other fighter that you don't want any trouble - even if a fight is imminent. Do this by holding your hands up by your face, palms outward, in a backing away motion - waving your hands slightly. This is the first set up to strike. Tell them you don't want any trouble - and regardless of what they say or do prepare yourself for a fight. \n In any street fight - especially against a larger or taller opponent you must get them first. The old adage "never swing first" does not apply. Use the open hand gesture above to launch a surprise first punch either to the throat or nose (never hit the jaw - this can be absorbed by most strong men and can hurt your hands). Speed is essential here. One punch is good but more punches are better. A combination of attacks or quick strikes will do more damage than one single strike, so if you can hit your opponent with more hits, do so. However, do not leave yourself open to a counter attack. Launch your fastest strike possible and immediately step back and return your hands to your face area for protection. While stepping back, circle around your opponent. \n If your opponent is still active you must make sure you keep your hands by your face at all times. This will allow you to use your hands, elbows, and shoulders to deflect punches and strikes from your opponent because they can launch strikes from a distance. Most fighters who are immature or inexperienced will try to hit the head area 90 per cent of the time. Use this to your advantage by keeping the hands up and moving your head and shoulders from side to side and up and down in a bobbing and weaving type motion. Your opponent will fire away at your head out of habit - but will connect on much less of his strikes. You will be harder to hit and confusing to defend when you launch strikes of your own. All the while you are ready to shuffle backwards, in a circle motion, on the feet to create space between you and your opponent while they advance. \n Your opponent will come at you with a combination or attack of some kind and once you avoid it, or block it, you will notice a moment when they pull back for an instant and regroup for another attack. As SOON AS your opponent has thrown the last of their strikes in a particular attack you must immediately step into their personal space - close to them - and attack viciously. You get close-in on them where their reach is negated. Using speed and a close-in attack will force them to retreat or back pedal. Throw with speed and ferocity - NOT PANIC - as many shots to their face and exposed areas as possible. Right before exhaustion you step out of their reach - not just a step back - but two or three steps back and regain your strength and stamina. DO NOT clutch or grab your opponent if they have a significant size or strength advantage. This will only turn out bad for you. This close-in attack approach is THE RULE for fighting taller guys. You can wait for them to finish an attack, as stated above, or you can get them by beating them to the punch when they come in. Either way you must close the gap and get inside of their long reach to do damage. \n This is important to look for because you can use these patterns to hurt your opponent with a counter strike. Let's say your opponent is always throwing a long jab punch and then letting their hands drop down to their waist area before returning their fist to their facial area. You could wait until the timing is right on their next jab and, after you avoid it, throw a power punch right over the top of their outstretched arm (as it begins its drop to their waist) and hit them square in the face. Or if you see a wild, winging power-punch coming from their right hand you could duck it and throw a counter-punch combo of your own. These counter strikes are lethal because they usually combine your power with the momentum of your opponents to hurt them extra bad! \n How do you do this? You simply step at an angle to one side while coming in - so you are facing your opponent, ready to attack - but you are not directly in front of them. You are at an angle - and therefore the usual instinctive indicators that we use to judge a target are slightly less effective here for your opponent. Also you will notice new opportunities to hit areas of weakness in your opponents defense from these angles. Also notice that you should preferably be working angles that position you away from their power. So if your opponent is throwing hard right crosses and hooks, you should be working angles that position you towards their left hand - away from the power. \n You must set up your combos and strikes by throwing out a solid jab. Each jab thrown requires a step forward with the lead foot. Use several jabs in succession with your step footwork in order to close in on your taller opponent and smother their long reach. Get deep into their personal space by setting them up with the jab and drop power shots to their ribs when they bring their defensive guard up to protect the face. \n 
 Most pans come with an indented top, to make it easier to decorate it like a cupcake.\n You need to decorate with a firm cake. \n Cover it with plastic wrap so that it doesn’t dry out. \n More than taste, it will serve as a glue to hold your fondant down. \n It is more important that you have an even layer than if it looks nice. The evenness of the top and sides will create an even base for the fondant. \n Apply it to the top and rotate your cake to cover the angled surface. \n If the cake is looking bare in places, add more frosting. \n Fondant should not sit out for long, or it will dry out., Then measure the angled height. You will need to double the height and add the width to find the diameter of your fondant circle. \n For example, if your cupcake top is six inches wide and five inches from base to top, your round will need to be 16 inches wide to ensure it more than covers your cake top. \n There will be more excess fondant than with a traditional cake \n Use a plastic fondant mat or cover your clean rolling space with a dusting of cornstarch. \n It will make it more pliable and ready to roll. \n Roll it into a circle, and then move the circle continuously to make an even circle. Always move from the middle to an inch from the outside of the circle. \n Cut off any spare fondant outside of your circle with a fondant cutter or knife. \n Pick up the sides of the rolling pin. \n Align the back edge of the fondant with an edge of the cupcake half. Roll the pin away from you so that the rest of the fondant slowly covers the cake., Smooth the fondant down from the center toward the base. Work slowly and smooth areas down below the bottom of the cake \n It is ok to have a wrinkle after the edge of the cake, because you can cut it off. \n Use your hands to indent the fondant along with the shape of the cupcake. \n Turn the cake so that you can see where the fondant meets the base. Smooth the bottom edges with your fingers, so that it adheres completely to the buttercream. \n Repeat with this process with the bottom section of the cake, usually in a different color of fondant, to mimic the look of a cupcake liner. You will need to cover the bottom of the cupcake by turning it upside down. \n Place it on a cake stand or base. \n Lay the top section on top of it. Take care to make the cupcake halves to align so that it looks like a real cupcake. \n
 \n \n Fold it in half again from the bottom to make it even smaller. \n If the t-shirt is already a small size, you may not need to fold it twice horizontally. \n Smooth it out with the arms to the sides. Take care to remove all wrinkles at each step in the process; any wrinkles that you make now will be very pronounced when you reach your destination. \n The edge of the cuff should be parallel to the edge of the shirt, rather than tilted. Fold it just past the center of the shirt, approximately where the left side of the collar ends. \n It should extend to an imaginary line below the right side of the collar. Smooth the sleeves down. \n Grab the shoulder seam and the bottom edge and fold vertically into the middle. \n Folding the edge into the center. With fitted shirts, the sides of the shirt will meet at the top of the back, but not necessarily at the bottom. \n Skip this step if you plan to wrap shirts in your suitcase to decrease the chance of wrinkles even further. \n Place it over the bottom half of your vertically folded shirt. \n Smooth it out. By wrapping your shirts, they are more likely to stay in place and less likely to cause wrinkles. \n Then, lay your wrapped shirts in a single layer over them. Alternate them with the collars at different ends if you need to pack them in several layers. \n 
 You should know how tags work and of the src and href attributes.\n You will find that there are very many properties. However, it is not necessary to learn them all. \n Some good basic CSS properties to know are color and font-family. \n All properties need a value. For the color property, for example, you might put the red value. \n It is used within an element like href or src. To use it, within the quotation marks after the equal sign, put the CSS attribute, a colon, and then the value of the property. This is known as a CSS rule. \n Inline CSS can add unnecessary clutter to an HTML document. However, it is a great way to get introduced to how CSS works. \n It should allow you to create HTML and CSS files. \n If you don't have a special program installed, you can use Notepad or another text editor. Simply save your file both as a text file and a CSS file. \n You should open this with an HTML editor as well, if you have one installed. \n HTML editors allow you to edit HTML and CSS at the same time. \n This will let you write CSS without the need for a separate file. \n To make your code more legible, always put the second curly brace on its own line. \n Each line must end with a semicolon (;). To make your code legible, each rule should start on its own line and each line should be indented. \n It is very important to note that this styling will affect all elements of the selected type on the page. More specific styling will be covered in the next section. \n Open your HTML file as well. \n This will allow you to link a separate CSS file to your HTML document. Your link tag needs three attributes: rel, type, and href. \n rel means "relationship" and tells the browser what the relationship is to the HTML document. Here it should have a value of "stylesheet". \n type tells what type of media is being linked to. Here it should have a value of "text/css" \n href here is used similarly to how it is used in an <a> element, but here it must link to a CSS file. If the CSS file is located in the same folder as the HTML file, only the file name needs to be written within the quotation marks. \n Add a class attribute to these elements and set them equal to a class name of your choice. This will give your elements the same styling. \n Type the class name in your CSS file with a period (.) preceding it (i.e. .class). \n Id's are created in CSS using a pound symbol (#) rather than a period. \n Id's are more specific than classes, so an id will override any class styling if it has an attribute with a different value than the class. \n It is an official website aimed at teaching web development skills. The w3 has plenty of references listed for HTML and CSS, as well as other web languages. \n Sites like CSS tricks.com specifically are aimed at teaching CSS and web design skills. Finding reputable sources will help you on your learning journey. \n Their experience and know-how can teach you valuable knowledge and skills. \n Viewing the CSS of well-developed websites can show you ways to design parts of websites. Copying it down as practice and fiddling with the code can help you learn how to use different CSS attributes. \n 
 For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known." Here Paul lays out that prophesies, tongues and knowledge will end at some point, but when? \n First he says, "We know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away." So he only mentions two of the three here in this statement. He mentions knowledge and prophesy but not tongues. "That which is perfect" that Paul is talking about has to be Heaven, because later he says that then we "shall see face to face." We didn’t see God face to face when the Bible was completed. So this is referring to when we get to Heaven, not the Bible being completed. So what part of what he says applies to tongues? When will tongues "be stilled" as he says?\n When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me." Some say that this statement applies to tongues. Yet, Paul did not directly state what in particular is to be put away as child-like. \n Tongues are a gift that strengthens a believer in the early time of their faith for some, this was why most new believers in Acts received tongues as their first spiritual gift, but when we become mature we are to "put the ways of childhood (the new believer) behind" us. So some say that Paul is telling them that they will need to outgrow tongues. He says many times in chapter 14 that to prophesy is far better than to speak in tongues because prophecy edifies others and builds up the church more. \n So what does becoming a man spiritually mean? It means to be able to eat spiritual steak and not just drink milk. When we fully understand more of who God is, Paul is/may be saying, we won’t need tongues, when we are mature. Tongues are for the new believer, the baby Christian, but as we grow in our walk we should be able to have the gift of teaching or preaching in order to instruct others, etc. Everyone can agree that Paul says "where there are tongues, they will be stilled and where there is knowledge, it will pass away." So when will tongues be stilled and when will knowledge cease? Not in heaven. Not when the Bible was completed. It is still a gift for today. But Paul is saying, it is for the new believer. Tongues is something that encourages people and nurtures their faith, when they are still at the beginning of their faith. But it says that somethings are set aside as we come into maturity as a Christian. \n So is this a good thing? No, for unless it is interpreted, no others can be edified by anything that is said in a tongue? 1 Corinthians 14:11 says, "If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church." \n Paul is saying here that tongues, alone, generally do not build up the church. Yes! The person oneself may be edified, as Paul says, "Anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God," so it could be seen as a good self-edifying time of prayer to God. But people in the church cannot be edified unless the tongue is interpreted. It may make someone feel closer to God when they speak in tongues, but it will not make anyone else feel closer to God unless the tongue is interpreted. \n If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God." Why? Because no one else understands what is being said in the tongue. Therefore, it cannot and does not edify any other person unless it is interpreted. \n Also note that he says only two or "at the most three" people are to speak in a tongue in public worship. In 1 Corinthians 13:1 Paul says, "If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal." So, it doesn’t matter, if someone is able to speak in the tongues of angels, but does so without love for others. If they do not respect others in using their gift of tongues, Paul says that they become only "a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal." \n Neither of those are a good or necessary thing. If a cymbal is used in an orchestra in time and rhythm, it sounds good. But if it is randomly clanged for no reason at all, that is not good. That is the picture Paul is trying to paint. What purpose does random tongues speaking serve? Tongues does not serve a purpose in the church unless it is in rhythm and order with the service. Paul is saying it becomes a distraction, if it is not done in love, if it is random. \n So how can the gift of tongues be done in love in the church -- only when the tongues are quickly interpreted so that everyone can know what is being said. Amen. Paul says, "Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air." To speak in tongues without an interpreter does not promote fellowship but rather it can isolate people. \n He confused their languages so that they could NOT have fellowship with each other. He caused them all to speak a different language so that they would not be united enough to build the tower that they were trying to build. \n So for everyone to be speaking in a different language divides people. It does not promote unity. Overall, does the gift of tongues in public worship unite the church or dis-unify the church? Paul is saying that it can dis-unify the church. Why? Because if no one knows what you are saying, how can you have fellowship with them? Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14:16, "When you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else…say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying -- Yes! -- as that is the problem with uninterpreted tongues. \n To practice the gift of tongues in public worship changes the time of gathering together from a community meeting and time of fellowship to a singular event that is between you and God. No one else understands what the speaker is saying, unless it is interpreted, so what is the point? In community worship, speaking in tongues is pointless unless it is interpreted. That is why Paul says tongues need to be interpreted, if they are used in the church. \n Paul says, "Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church." Is it good to edify yourself -- Yes! -- but, when Christians gather together the focus needs to be on edifying the other Christians, not on yourself. We need to think of how we can bless the other people, not just how we can build ourselves up. \n Why did he do that? Paul did that for a reason. At the end of chapter 12 Paul says, "Now eagerly desire the greater gifts. And yet I will show you the most excellent way." So what is the more excellent way? Love. \n Paul is saying spiritual gifts are great, but love is better. If someone has every single spiritual gift on the list, but doesn’t have love, then he/she has nothing. Love should be the highest goal for the Christian, not spiritual gifts. \n Often times spiritual gifts can actually even become an idol. People start to worship the spiritual gift rather than God. That might happen in some churches regarding the gift of tongues. \n It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. " Think of this passage in the context of tongues. \n Are tongues patient? Not generally in how they are practiced. To be patient would be to talk in turn, not everyone speaking at once. \n Are tongues kind? If someone degrades someone else or says that they are not Christian because they don't have the gift of tongues no, that is definitely not kind or loving to other believers! \n Do tongues cause envy? Usually the reason why people speak in tongues in church is to show how "spiritual" they are. In essence, they want other people in the church to acknowledge them because of their gift of tongues. \n Do tongues lead to boasting -- Yes! -- if it becomes like a super power that the Christian who has it brags about to the ones who don’t have it. This is not loving and being in fellowship with other believers. \n Do tongues make some people proud -- Yes!, but why -- because it really is a great privilege to instantly know another language without having to learn it or study it for years. It takes most people 3 years to learn a new language, on average, but with the gift of tongues, you can bypass all that effort. But is this spiritual gift given to make ourselves more prideful or to boost our ego? No. Of course not. That is never why spiritual gifts are given. They are given to us so that mature Christians can edify one another. Period. \n \n Do tongues build up others or do they sometimes dishonor others? Anytime that you are leaving other people out for any reason, that dishonors them. Are tongues self-seeking? Often times yes. If people are doing it to appear more spiritual, that is self-seeking. If they do it to get the praises of man, that is self-seeking, yes. Are some tongues speakers easily angered? If you tell them their tongue has to be interpreted or they must remain silent in any public setting, yes that can anger people with the gift of tongues. But these are the rules Paul lays out that we are all supposed to follow. These are not just man made rules that tongues must be interpreted. \n So Paul is saying essentially, "This is not just me writing this. These are not just my opinions. These are 'the commandments of the Lord.' " As in everything he just said about gifts of the Holy Spirit including tongues is on the same level as the 10 Commandments. So they need to be taken very literally and very seriously. \n How does that relate to spiritual gifts or tongues? Well, evil would be any kind of dissension in the body of Christ. Disagreeing on the gifts of the Holy Spirit can cause dissension. So, that is not good. Also, some have said that they have heard tongues that were demonically inspired rather than God inspired. We would hope that people could discern the difference, but it is not always possible, such as when the fruit of speaker is not yet known by the hearers. \n Regardless of whether someone can speak in tongues or not, if the tongue is from Satan, we should not delight in it at all, obviously. There are counterfeit tongues. Satan can give people a counterfeit gift of tongues. In many other religions around the world people are also able to speak in tongues. Their gift of tongues is not from God though, but from Satan. \n Tongues would always need to be interpreted, so that we can know for sure whether what is being said is from God or not -- as in to make sure it's not from Satan. \n In regard to tongues, we need to protect others from possibly getting a demonically inspired gift of tongues. To push people to speak in tongues might lead them without knowing it to demonic tongues. \n If the Holy Spirit wants to give someone the gift of tongues, He will. We don’t need to force it at all. It will be an easy thing to do, if God really wants you to do it. But to force it can actually cause Satan to give you a counterfeit gift. \n To desire tongues more than we desire following Christ is totally out of line. The Spirit of God will say, "Jesus Christ is Lord of all." Yes? (1 Corinthians 12:3). So, we need to be careful. That is "whatever you are doing, do it as unto The Lord," as you are guided by the Bible and the Holy Spirit. If you have the mind of Christ then agreeing together is important, not doubting. Expressing disagreement with the clear Word of God in the Bible is dissension. You must follow Jesus, not the gifts or words of a man or woman who is not speaking the Gospel with Love. \n Paul says, "Love always trusts." Then you will trust that a true servant of the Lord is saying good things to you or about you, even if you can’t hear it or understand what he/she is saying, yes? So, if someone prays for someone in a tongue, how can the other person know and trust that what is being said is good? One cannot for sure know that what is being said is good, by the unknown words that are spoken. So you will know them by their fruits, and then your trust is placed in the Lord, not in the flesh. \n You trust by Love, and then do not cause dissension. Trust the Lord's servant as you trust the Lord. Who is a true servant of the Lord? A servant must be consistently proclaiming The Truth including: Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, came as God in the flesh, died and was raised again to life as Lord and Savior of all. And we must repent and be born again by receiving Salvation "in His name by grace, through faith not of oneself, not of works, it is the gift of God,... saved unto good works that God foreordained that we should do them" (Ephesians 2:8--10). And we actively love, speak well of, and forgive one another, and we take communion in remembrance of Jesus Christ, and we baptize believers; and say that Jesus is now living forever, always making intercession for us and is our soon coming King. As long as that person is agreeing with and speaking that kind of Gospel, under authority of God's word in the Bible presented accurately, then Trust the servant of the Gospel as unto the Lord. \n It might be exciting for some. It can be used to witness to people we would not have otherwise been able to witness to. It can draw someone closer to God. But any public setting, the worshipers and service need to be controlled and moderated by a pastor or other minister. We need to always, always exercise the gift with self-control. \n In 1 Corinthians 14:32 Paul says, "The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets." This means we should be able to control any spiritual gift that we have. A spiritual gift should never cause us to be out of control, out of order -- or to go against the Bible. \n Paul goes on to say, "For God is not the author of confusion but of peace." Amen! Other translations say, "God is a God of order, not disorder." So, anything that causes disorder or confusion is not from God, or for sure God does not approve of it. Always remember to seek agreement, to be in one accord. \n 
 Test every character thoroughly whether you'll use them or not. \n Get to know them like the back of your hand. It's better to Study all of their moves at all kinds of percents on all kinds of characters. Get to know characters' weights and fall speeds so you have a general idea of what kinds of combos may or may not work, on whom, after a bit of practice., This includes combo DI, survival DI, SDI, perfect shielding, powershielding, wavedashing, wavelanding, etc.- things you'll need to rely on when an attack is coming your way or you've been hit., This includes tech chases, chain grabs, and combos. Many characters have a "touch-of-death" on others. Try to figure out how you can punish someone to death (or at least get the most amount of % possible) after you have gotten a grab or landed a combo-starting hit., (e.g. will I land safely if I jump? / Will I get punished for using this attack while they're at this percent?, etc)., Movement is very important in top and high level play, as it can eliminate most of your need to use shielding or dodging- which should typically be used as a last resort. In addition to movement you should also strive to have great defensive spacing., You should be absolutely certain that your attack or grab will land land., You should especially be watching out for their grabs or their quickest moves, as these options are typically used as kill setups when your opponent knows that fishing for kill moves probably won't work on you., Watching smash will help you tremendously, on both a conscious and a subconscious level. There are many streams about, but Tourney Locator, Clash Tournaments, and AZ Project Melee are among the most popular.
 Content ID is a system that identifies potential copyrighted content in videos by scanning uploaded videos for previously-uploaded content. The system will scan for audio, video, and images. If a match occurs, the original owner is notified and a Content ID claim is filed. \n The original owner can choose to do nothing, mute their audio in your video, block the video from being viewed, monetize the video, or track the video's viewership.\n Content ID claims are not necessarily a negative thing for your account. If you're fine with part of the audio being blocked or with ad revenue going to the original owner, you can decide not to do anything. \n The only time a Content ID claim can be negative is when the owner blocks your video globally. This can put your account in bad standing. \n If your claim was because of a song used in your video, you can try Youtube's automated removal tools to take the song out without having to re-upload the video:Open the Video Manager page and find the video you want to remove or swap the song from. \n Click the ▼ button next to "Edit" and select "Audio." \n Click "Remove this song" next to the Content ID'd song you want to remove. This may not be possible on all videos. \n Select a replacement track if you'd like from the YouTube Audio Library. Many of these songs are free to use and monetize. \n This is mainly for uploaders that create cover songs, and allows you to share revenue with the original owner:Find the video in your Video Manager. You can see which videos apply for this in the Monetization section of your account. \n Click the gray "$" button next to the video. This will only appear if the content owner has enabled the revenue sharing feature on their end. \n Wait for the request to be reviewed and approved. You will be notified if the owner approves sharing revenue. \n If you believe the Content ID claim is not valid, you can file a dispute. The claimant will have 30 days to respond to a dispute. You should only dispute if you believe your video was misidentified because you own or have rights to all of the content. If you dispute without a valid reason, you can receive a copyright strike. \n You can open it directly at youtube.com/my_videos_copyright. \n This will display what content was flagged by Content ID. \n If you still believe the claim was invalid, proceed. \n You'll only be able to continue if you select the last four options in the list. Only choose a reason that is actually true, or you will receive a copyright strike. These include: \n The video is my original content and I own all of the rights to it. \n I have a license or written permission from the proper rights holder to use this material. \n My use of the content meets the legal requirements for fair use or fair dealing under applicable copyright laws. \n The content is in the public domain or is not eligible for copyright protection. \n You'll be asked to review your choice and check a box to confirm that you're sure the claim is false. \n You'll be asked to type out a short summary of why you're filing a dispute. Make sure to clearly explain why you believe your video fits the description you picked above. Keep the message short and to the point. \n Don't worry about using legal language here, just write natural sentences explaining why you believe your video should not have a Content ID claim filed against it. \n This will formalize the claim, and it will be sent to YouTube for review. Filing fraudulent disputes can lead to your account being disabled. \n If you've received a copyright strike on your video, it's because the original creator or owner has decided that your video does not fall under "fair use." Fair use allows you to use content that others have created, but only in specific circumstances that are decided on a case-by-case basis. Fair use is a fairly complicated topic, but generally your video will be measured against the following four factors (in the US):The purpose of using the copyrighted content. The video needs to add new expression or meaning to the original copyrighted content. Non-profit and educational uses are given more leeway, but are not exempt. If your video is monetized, your chances of claiming fair use diminish. \n The nature of the copyrighted content. Using factual copyrighted content (e.g. news reports) is usually considered more fair than fictional content (e.g. movies). \n The ratio of copyrighted content to your own content. You'll have a better chance of claiming fair use if you only use a few bits and pieces of the copyrighted content, and the vast majority of the video is your own work. \n Harm done to the potential profits of the copyright holder. If your video can be perceived to cause a negative impact on the owner's profits, you are less likely to be eligible for fair use. Parody is the main exception to this. \n A copyright strike will stay in effect for six months on your account. During this time, you'll lose access to certain YouTube features, such as uploading videos longer than 15 minutes. This is your only course of action if the copyright claim was legitimate and you did in fact violate a copyright when posting the video. \n During the wait, you'll need to complete the YouTube Copyright School by watching a video and answering a few questions at youtube.com/copyright_school. \n If you receive another copyright strike during this waiting period, your six month waiting period will restart. \n If you receive three strikes, your account will be terminated. \n If possible, contacting the claimant may be quicker than appealing your strike. If the claimant has a YouTube account, use the private message function to send them a message. If a corporation or other entity filed the claim, you'll need to find and contact their copyright department. \n Be polite when requesting a retraction, and clearly explain why you believe the strike was a mistake. Don't just say "fair use;" give evidence for why you believe the claim to be wrong. \n The claimant is under no obligation to retract the copyright strike claim. \n If you believe your video does not violate fair use, or you think the copyright strike was an error and you don't actually use copyrighted material, you can file a counter-notification.This is a legal claim. By filing a counter-notification, the claimant will be able to see your personal information, and you open yourself up to lawsuits. \n The counter-notification takes ten days to process. The claimant may file a court order during this time to keep your video offline. \n If you decide you want to submit a counter-notification, you can do so from the Copyright Notices section of your account (youtube.com/my_videos_copyright). All of the videos that you have received strikes for will be listed here. \n If you see a "Matched third party content" or "Video blocked" message next to a video, this is a Content ID claim, and is handled differently than a copyright strike. See the next section for details. \n This will begin the submission process. \n You will be warned that you should not proceed unless you are prepared to take your case to court. You should only proceed if you are sure that your video should not have received the strike. \n Check the "I have read the above statement" box to reveal the form. \n You'll need to enter your real name, address, and phone number. This information will be made available to the claimant. \n If you have a lawyer, you can enter your lawyer's contact information instead. \n Enter in your reasoning for why your video falls under fair use, or why it was mistakenly identified. You don't have a lot of room in this field, so be clear and to the point. This will not be sent to the claimant. \n You can include a message to the claimant as well. You may want to reiterate why you're filing the claim, so that they can retract the claim if necessary. Avoid attacks in this message. \n This will make the form legally binding. You'll need to agree to all of the statements to proceed. \n The process takes about ten days to complete. If your video is found to be covered under fair use or was mistakenly identified, it will be restored and the strike removed from your account. If the claim is denied, the video will stay offline and the strike will remain. In very rare cases, you may be sued by the claimant to keep the video offline. \n If you are unable to submit an online counter-notification because your account has been disabled, you can send one via email, post, or fax. Include your name, address, phone number, video URL, and signature. Make sure to also include the two required statements on this page, where you can also find the mailing address and fax number. \n 
 Camp is a place where you can make friends and make memories while having a great time in the outdoors.\n Use and improve your skills while you have time. It may become a hobby to enjoy once you're good at it. Let's say you are enthused about classic cars. You can help your dad restore a classic car and show it. \n Summer doesn't have to be fun and games. It can also be a time for resting your brain after all that hard work at school. Go ahead; sleep in if you want. Watch some television, walk around in your bare feet, just whatever puts you in a calm mood. \n You will learn to work in a group, which will be both beneficial in life and fun. Choose one that you truly enjoy or that requires the skills that you have (such as hand/eye coordination). There are always summer sports, camps, and some schools may have sports in the summer, such as track or lacrosse. \n Now you can actually work towards them without the worries of what others at school will think of you. Go ahead and lose weight, clear up your skin, pursue a hobby, feed your knowledge, just whatever floats your boat. \n Go to the mall, the beach, the library, ride a bike, or hang out with a group of friends. You can also have a party or sleepover if you're allowed. Now you don't have to worry about your parents saying, "No, because it's a school night." \n if you already skate, go to Camp Woodward, even if you don't have the money you can wash dishes and do chores for an hour a day and skate the rest to pay for it.Try not to be a skater punk though. Be aware, you might get the look. \n Many people find it more enjoyable as it is to many easier to get into. \n During the summer there can be a lot opportunities. Start a fundraiser to help support a good cause! Have a garage sale, a yard sale, a bake sale, a car wash, anything! \n You could take time to write a novel, find out who you truly are, discover the meaning of life, look for true beauty, or have some "family time." Now that you don't have the stress of peer pressure and studying, you have the time. \n Not only will you get a chance to work on your tan in the hot sun and spray your friends with hoses, but you'll be making money too. You can use that money to do something later. \n This is still fun during the day as well as night. Just make sure you can convince some friends to come with you. It's somewhat embarrassing to be caught alone in a movie theater. \n Exercise is healthy and is a good way to meet members of the opposite (or same) sex, or to entertain any younger siblings that you may caring for. What's not to like? \n It sounds childish, but it actually can be fun if you have enough people and enough space. Try it in a public area like a mall or a crowded shopping type area., You are your own master and if you want to stay home one day to relax, do it! \n If you live in a warm area, grab some blankets and a pillow and sleep out on the lawn furniture, under the stars. It's very relaxing, and might be the best night of sleep you'll get all summer. \n Crack a window open if you can, and wake up to the sounds of the morning; people mowing the lawn, your mom making breakfast downstairs, etc. If you're not tired, go on a late night walk or jog. Usually the sprinklers are on at this time and its just a lot of fun to see your neighborhood in the middle of the night. \n This will help you keep up on your writing skills for school, too. Write down words that you like, poems, song lyrics, what happened during basketball practice, anything you want! Keep it under your mattress if you want to keep it private; this only works if you step up and change your own sheets. And most importantly, write in it everyday; maybe wait to look at the previous pages until the very end of summer, when it should be all full. \n It will help you get in shape and you will enjoy being in nature. \n It's something to do, you meet new people, and you will have a great body when school starts again! \n This is entertaining and will help you do better in school come fall with the new vocabulary you have learned. Focus on your brain; something useful to make you smarter and more interesting to others. \n It's a great way to get rid of junk or things that you don't use anymore! Plus you can make a good amount of money through this. You can also ask your parents to create an eBay account so you can buy and sell items on eBay. \n That is a way to catch up with your schoolwork, learn a new hobby, or prepare for future education. In this generation, you don't have to be "college age" to go to college; you can get college degrees online at the age of 14. If you can't find any online classes, try taking community ed classes at your local library. \n Enjoy it; the rest of the year you are involved in school. \n 
\n These sections will create your paddles once glued onto both sides of the water wheel itself. \n The protractor will not only help you make an even circle, but will also mark the center of the circle for you. The center is where axle, or beam, will be placed in order to connect the 2 sides of the water wheel and allow the wheel to spin. \n The "A" should be 4 inches (10.16 cm) tall by 4 inches (10.16 cm) wide. At the very top middle point of the "A" shape, mark a small "v" shape; this will be the inlet that the axle is placed in. Outline an extra 2 � 2 1/2 inch (6.35 cm) long x 3/4 inch (1.905 cm) wide rectangles for the water wheel stand support. \n Make sure each paddle is positioned at a diagonal towards the center of the water wheel. Use the image of spokes on a bike to help with this positioning. \n Make sure it goes through both sides and sticks out of each side equally. Set the wheel aside. \n Do so by attaching the rectangular support beams to the left side of one of the "A" shapes, directly under the horizontal line across the middle of the shape. Do the same for the second support beam on the right hand side. Pin or glue the opposite "A" shape to the support beams that you have just attached to the first "A" shape to complete the support system. \n Place the axle in the "v" shaped grooves at the top of each "A" shape. This will allow your water wheel to spin. \n Place a small amount of water in the miniature bucket and see how much water it takes to run over the water wheel in order to spin and lift the miniature bucket of water. \n 
 You'll need to overcome a few factors on your way to becoming a train operator, but the biggest obstacle in your path is a union agreement made in 2008.According to this agreement, the TfL is not allowed to advertise externally and, instead, hires mostly from within the organization.Other positions with the TfL, like Customer Service Assistant, are open to the general public. The application process varies according to position, so you should research your options on the TfL website. \n Apprenticed youth (ages 16 - 18) may also be accepted into training as a train operator for the TfL.More information can be found in the "Getting an Apprenticeship" portion of this article.\n This might require some research on your part, as not all jobs with the TfL may be suitable for you and your goals. Once you gain a job with the TfL, you will be able to apply as a train operator. \n Some researchers have found that it is an effective strategy to first get a job with the TfL as a Customer Service Assistant and then apply for train operator when the position becomes available., Due to the cyclic nature of the hiring process, you may have to wait some time before the TfL begins hiring for the position you desire. If you apply for your position and are not contacted to continue the hiring process, don't give up hope! You should: \n Research desired traits of the position you apply for. \n Take related certification and safety courses. \n Volunteer in positions similar to the one you are pursuing to show your competence. \n The approximate number of new train operators, per year, is about 150.This means there will likely be considerable competition for the position. For you to stand the best chance possible, you'll need to take the application process seriously. \n This is a trait that is especially important while applying to be a train operator. After the application process, which can take a considerable time itself, training to be a train operator can take up to six months before you are ready to do the job on your own., The temptation of a great salary, higher than average vacation days, privacy, and a shorter than average work week can make it easy to gloss over the difficult points of this position. As a train operator, you'll need to be able to bear: \n Long stretches of time on your own. \n Extreme hot and cold conditions. \n Small, dark spaces. \n Repetitive, accuracy dependent work., Once it is finished, you can send it to the address listed on the form or, if directed by your superior to do so, return the form to him or the colleague he indicates. \n The length of time it takes for the TfL to process the initial application response can be quite long., This test is timed for 30 minutes and is intended to evaluate your potential ability as a train operator.Prior to your test, you should look over any provided materials. The TfL gives sample questions for the purpose of preparing for this test. \n As the TfL is constantly improving its training procedures, there may be additional assessments required of you at the time of your test. \n These sections serve to measure: \n Psychological stability \n On-the-job aptitude \n Personality evaluation, The English portion of the assessment centre test is aimed at determining how skillfully receive and express information in written word. Spelling, clarity, and accuracy should be made a priority during this portion of the test., As an operator of a train in the London underground, you'll have to use the Public Address (PA) system on your train to communicate with its passengers. Due to the fact that many PA systems are less than adequate, clear speaking is particularly important. You will be tested on your PA skills by: \n Receiving practice information to relay to passengers. \n Writing out your announcement as you intend on making it. \n Recording it into an audio tape., Levers, pulleys, and ramps might not seem like something you need to review, but the assessment centre test will also evaluate your mechanical comprehension. This will involve you looking at mechanical diagrams and then predicting the result of the mechanism in question. The second part of the mechanical portion of the test will require you to evaluate systems that affect each other.You will have to find all errors in these that might cause the system to breakdown. \n The final leg of your assessment centre testing will likely involve two computer tests intended to gauge your abilities of concentration and reflex. The concentration activity involves picking out specified groupings of dots within a time limit, and the reflex test utilizes external prompts, like lights and sounds, which you will respond to with a special keyboard.To improve these two areas, you may want to: \n Run through woodlands \n Play dodgeball \n Play reaction based video games \n Play puzzle/response based games, This is the final step assessing your competence as a potential train operator for the London underground. During this test, TfL staff will ask you questions pertaining to the job and you will be expected to answer to the best of your ability. These questions may also include inquiry about: \n Why you want to be a train operator. \n How you would respond in a certain situation. \n Line/depot suitability., The training process for becoming a train operator for the tube can take anywhere from 6 - 12 months depending on individual factors.Once your training is complete, you will begin working on your own as a train operator. Generally, over the course of your training, you will: \n Receive an introduction to general information about the London underground. \n Familiarize yourself with Operational Procedures Training. \n Tour the depot and examine roster/duty sheet information. \n Learn about basic train knowledge., Though union agreements make it all but impossible for a non-union member to get a job as a train operator for the tube, a loophole in the agreements does allow for apprenticeships.The general requirements to become an apprentice include: \n Being between 16 and 18 years of age. \n Having no less than four GCSEs \n Physical ability, Though well salaried and seemingly straightforward, the job of a train operator has many difficult points as well. If you are uncomfortable in confined spaces for long periods of time, dislike the dark or early/late shifts, are sensitive to extreme weather conditions, or find concentrating on repetitive tasks difficult, a job as a train operator for the tube might not be for you., The hiring process usually follows a predictable pattern, which enables organizations like TfL to schedule application submissions. The next open enrollment for apprenticeships begins January 7, 2016.For more information or to read the 2016 apprenticeship brochure, visit: \n https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/careers/apprenticeships \n Once you have been accepted into the apprenticeship program, you'll be allowed to continue in the evaluation portion of the assessment process.This may be similar to the assessments given to regular workers of TfL who are applying to become a train operator, and may include: \n Multiple choice tests \n English testing \n Enunciation testing \n Mechanical knowledge testing \n Concentration tests \n Reflex response tests
 Allergens are substances that can cause allergic reactions. Airborne allergens are allergens that travel through the air, such as dust, animal fur, pollen from trees, and grass. You should look for any possible sources of airborne allergens in your home. This could be dusty floors or windowsills, fur from the family pet, and pollen from indoor plants or flowers.You should also note irritants like cigarette smoke and air pollution. Check your household cleaning products for any irritating chemicals and fragrances. These airborne irritants can trigger asthma attacks. \n There are also other allergens, such as cockroaches and mold, that should be noted and removed. These allergens can trigger asthma attacks in your child if they are not addressed and eliminated.\n Asthma can be triggered by exercise and physical activities as these put stress on your child’s respiratory system. While it is important that your child get enough physical exercise to stay healthy, you should also monitor her exercise to ensure it is not irritating her asthma.Studies suggest that doing physical activity can actually reduce the frequency of your child’s asthma attacks in the long term. But it is important to find a balance. You want your child to do enough physical activity to stay healthy without triggering her asthma. \n The chemicals used to preserve foods can trigger asthma. Sulfites are one of the most common preservatives, often found in a number of foods and drinks. Read food labels to ensure they do not contain preservatives that will trigger an asthma attack in your child. \n Respiratory infections, such as a bad cold or a viral infection in the lungs, can lead to asthma attacks. If you suspect your child might have other health conditions that are putting her at a greater risk of an asthma attack, you should bring her to the doctor for a check up. The doctor can examine her and determine if she requires medication to treat the infection.Other health conditions like heartburn and sleep apnea can also trigger asthma. Heartburn is also known as acid reflux and can develop due to a poor diet or digestive issues. Sleep apnea is a condition where the person has shallow or interrupted breathing while sleeping, often due to enlarged tonsils or adenoids, which can disrupt your sleep and also trigger breathing conditions like asthma., Asthma attacks can be triggered by some medications such as aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and beta-blockers.Beta-blockers are often prescribed for heart issues. Your doctor should avoid prescribing NSAIDs or beta-blockers for your child as they have shown to trigger asthma attacks and other health issues for individuals with asthma.However, do not stop administering your child's medications without talking to your child's doctor first. \n You should also avoid giving your child aspirin as it can trigger asthma attacks. \n Emotional stress can act as a trigger for asthma. You should check in periodically with your child to ensure she is not experiencing any stress from school or trauma at home. You should also monitor your child’s behavior and note any signs of stress or trauma., Smoke from cigarettes and cigars can be a major asthma trigger for your child. Set a no smoking rule in your home. If you live in a housing complex or an apartment building that is not smoke-free, work with your neighbors and your landlord to advocate for a smoke-free environment in the building.You can also use the policy brief supplied by the American Lung Association to help create a smoke free environment in the entire building or complex., Using natural fibers in your home can greatly reduce asthma triggers as dust and allergens are less likely to get trapped in natural fibers.You should wash all bedding, towels, rugs, and curtains at least once a week in hot water and dry them on high heat to remove any allergens. \n You should also avoid using down-filled pillows and comforters as they can carry allergens. Put a mattress cover on your child’s mattress to prevent allergens from burrowing in her mattress. You should also use pillow covers on your child’s pillows to protect her from allergens in her pillows. \n Switching to all-natural cleaning products will help to reduce the number of chemical allergens in your home. Go for unscented products as they are usually less irritating.You should also try to keep your house clean and dust free. Use a damp cloth to get rid of dust on all flat surfaces in your home. Vacuum once a week with a vacuum that has a HEPA filter to really make sure there is no dust lying around in your home. This will greatly reduce your child’s risk of an asthma attack., Mold can be a major asthma trigger for your child. You should take steps to keep your home well-ventilated and dry as this will reduce the development of mold.Set up a dehumidifier in any spots that prone to dampness in your home, such as the bathroom or the basement. \n If you cannot keep certain areas well ventilated, you should use an ozonator or a 100 W bulb on the area at all times to keep the area warm and dry. This will prevent mold from developing. \n Check shower curtains, the back of doors, and walls for any mold. Remove the mold by using a solution of one part chlorine bleach and nine parts water (1 cup bleach combined with nine cups water). \n You should also check your houseplants periodically to ensure there is no mold developing in the soil. If there is mold, replace the soil or repot the plant. \n Carpeting is a big carrier of chemicals, dust, mold, and dander from pets. If possible, replace your carpet with tile flooring and natural fiber rugs. Natural fiber rugs are easier to keep clean than carpeting.If you cannot afford to pull out carpet and replace it, make an effort to keep the carpet clean. Use a steam cleaner on the carpets at least twice a month and vacuum the carpet with a good vacuum on a daily basis so allergens do not build up in the carpet. \n Pests like cockroaches can carry allergens that can trigger asthma attacks. You should make sure your home is cockroach-free. This may mean getting your home professionally treated for roaches through a pest removal service.You should specify that there individuals with asthma in your home and ensure the service is familiar with exterminating pests in asthma-prone homes. The service should not use aerosol sprays or any other chemicals that could trigger asthma attacks. \n These materials can collect dust and other allergens that can trigger asthma attacks. Try not to let paper materials sit in your home for long periods of time. Set up a recycling bin outside for paper materials or in an area where your child does not spend a lot of time., One way to do this is to check local reports about pollen and ozone counts. Pollen counts tend to be the highest between five and ten am, depending on where you are located. You may want to keep your child indoors during these times and check local air quality before you let your child go outside to ensure it is not too polluted.If you are not sure which allergens are causing your child’s asthma, you may ask your child’s doctor to skin-test her for common triggers. These could include pollen, dust mites, pet dander, and air pollution. You could then limit your child’s exposure to their allergens to reduce her risk of an asthma attack. \n Since one common trigger for asthma is an upper respiratory infection like the flu, get your child vaccinated for the flu every year. (Adults with asthma should be vaccinated against the flu as well.) \n Asthma can be triggered by food allergies and food sensitivities. You should remove these foods from your child’s diet so she is not triggered.You can also determine which foods are acting as triggers by keeping a food diary. Note the foods your child eats during the day and any reactions she has to the food. If the reaction is negative or asthma inducing, you should eliminate that food from her diet. \n Your doctor can order blood tests for food allergies if it is unclear which foods are causing the problem. \n If your child is triggered by animal dander and animal fur, you should let her interact with only pets and animals that are hypoallergenic. This may mean replacing the family pet with a hypoallergenic pet or only allowing your child to play with friends’ pets that are hypoallergenic., Your child should get into the habit of carrying her asthma inhaler with her at all times, especially when she will be exercising. Her inhaler may be necessary when she is doing exercise, such as playing a sport or going for a run.You should not totally limit your child’s exercise as she needs to stay healthy. But you should make sure she has her inhaler in case of any issues and does not push herself too hard when doing exercise, as this could lead to an asthma attack. \n If you haven’t already, you should start a daily diary that records your child’s asthma symptoms. You should also note any possible triggers, from environmental to emotional. Update the dairy if you notice any other triggers as this will allow you to stay on top of your child’s asthma triggers and reduce her risk of an attack., An Asthma Action Plan can be developed with your doctor and is a good way to develop a plan of action in the event of an asthma attack. An Asthma Action Plan can also help you to track your child’s asthma triggers and take steps to avoid them so your child does not have an asthma attack.The Asthma Action Plan will be broken down into three zones: the Green Zone, the Yellow Zone, and the Red Zone. These zones will help keep track of the severity of your child's asthma. The Green Zone is the normal, safe zone, where there are no issues with your child's breathing. The Yellow Zone is the warning zone, where your child is experiencing some asthma symptoms but is not yet experiencing a full on asthma attack. The Red Zone is the severe zone, where your child is having an asthma attack. If you cannot get your child's asthma under control using an inhaler or other techniques, you may need to take her to emergency care. \n You should give everyone in your family a copy of the Asthma Action Plan so everyone around your child is aware of the steps they can take to prevent your child from having an asthma attack. \n 
 Ask yourself if your goal is to work for a public airport or to get a position on a military base.\n Aircraft engine specialists must have a strong mechanical aptitude and knowledge of engineering and technology. \n Be sure to check out the information available on government websites if you want to work on a military base as an aircraft engine specialist. \n A special benefit of working for a branch of the military is the added plus of having them pay for part or all of your education in return for officially joining and training with them. \n You will discover that most military positions offer individuals an excellent benefit program even while they are undergoing training. \n Contact several instructors to get more information about your career options and to have any questions about the training requirements answered. \n An associate's degree or bachelor's degree will better prepare you for upper level management jobs. \n Also be aware that working on a military base will likely require an extensive background check and a security clearance. \n Upon officially being accepted, make arrangements to start your education and training and look forward to a rewarding career as an aircraft engine specialist. \n 
 Whisk the flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add the water, beer, and vinegar. \n Fold the mixture with a rubber spatula. Use the spatula to scrape off the dry flour from the bottom of the bowl until a raggedy ball forms. \n Allow the dough to sit at room temperature for 8 to 18 hours. If leaving it overnight, take care not to leave near an open window if there is a cold breeze., Place the sheet of parchment paper inside the skillet, and spray the top of the paper with non-stick cooking spray., Knead lightly 10 to 15 times. There is no need to knead it beyond this amount., Do this by pulling the edges into the middle and creating a seam where the edges meet. Gently push the ball together. \n Remove the dough ball from the work surface and place it onto the parchment-lined skillet. Place it seam-side down. Spray the surface of the dough with non-stick cooking spray. \n Cover the dough ball loosely with plastic food wrap. \n Leave the dough to rise for about 2 hours, until it doubles in size, and doesn't spring back when poked with your finger. \n About 30 minutes before baking, put the oven rack in the lowest position. Place the Dutch oven (with lid) on the rack. Preheat the oven to 500ºF (260ºC)., Make a slit in the dough; take a razor blade and make a 6 inches (15.2cm) long and 1/2 inch (1.27cm) deep slit along the top of the dough. \n Another variation is to make a cross when slitting, as seen in this image. \n Lift out the pot from the oven with care (wear oven mitts), and remove the lid (keep your mitts on). \n Pick up the dough by lifting the parchment paper from its opposite edges. Lower the dough into the pot gently and fold down any overlapping pieces of parchment paper over the pot's edge. Replace the lid and put the bread dough into the oven. \n Bake the bread for 30 minutes with the lid sitting in place on the Dutch oven. \n After 30 minutes, remove the lid. This will allow the top of the bread to brown. Continue baking until you can see a deep-brown color. You can also test the center of the dough with a cooking thermometer – the bread is ready at 210ºF (99ºC) in the center. This will take another 15 to 30 minutes. \n Remove the bread from the pot and allow to cool on a wire cooling rack. \n Leave it to cool completely on the rack. It will reach room temperature in about 2 hours. \n Marmalade makes a delicious choice \n Serve with butter or other spread as wished. \n You'll need: \n 300 g flour \n 9 g kosher salt \n 5 g powdered yeast \n 1/4 quarter cup (or small handful) of flax meal or wheat germ \n A handful of brown sugar \n A big pinch of each dried thyme and dried rosemary \n 200ml water.\n A cover is nice - but you could use plastic wrap, a damp towel or even place the whole bowl in a plastic bag., Mix wet and dry - all you are trying to do is to get all the flour incorporated in the dough. Pretty doesn't count., Short is still not bad., It needs a top to hold in steam. Spray oil on the top and bottom., Work in the surface flour (adding as necessary). When done, make a ball and place in the baking pan., Minimum is doubled in size but could be 4x size for lighter bread., Set at 425ºF., Spray mist the oven with water. Set the timer for another 15 minutes., Let cool for 1 hour. Don't burn yourself., Spread with butter. Congratulate yourself and decide with whom you will share the rest of this loaf.
, We are interested to know the angle x formed where the the two side c's meet. Thinking about it, the original triangle was made of 180 degrees with the angle on the right at the far end of b, called theta, and the other angle at the top of a, being 90 degrees minus theta, as all the angles total 180 degrees and we already have one 90 degree angle. \n At the bottom, we have  theta, at the top left we have 90 degrees, and the top right we have 90 degrees minus theta. \n The mystery angle x is 180 degrees. So theta + 90 degrees-theta + x = 180 degrees. Adding theta and negative theta gives us zero on the left, and subtracting 90 degrees from both sides leaves x equal to 90 degrees. So we have established that the mystery angle x = 90 degrees. \n First, the formula for a trapezoid is A= the Height x (Base1 + Base 2)/2. The height is a+b and (Base1 + Base 2)/2 = 1/2(a + b). So that all equals 1/2 (a+b)^2. \n We have the two smaller triangles at bottom and left, and those together equal 2*1/2(a*b), which just equals (a*b). Then we also have 1/2 c*c, or 1/2 c^2. So together we have the other formula for the area of the trapezoid equaling (a*b)+ 1/2 c^2. \n 1/2(a+b)^2=(a*b)+1/2 c^2. Now multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the 1/2's \n 2(1/2 (a+b)^2) = 2((a*b)+ 1/2 c^2.) which simplifies as (a+b)^2 = 2ab + c^2. \n to obtain a^2 + b^2 = c^2, The Pythagorean Theorem! \n \n For more art charts and graphs, you might also want to click on Category:Microsoft Excel Imagery, Category:Mathematics, Category:Spreadsheets or Category:Graphics to view many Excel worksheets and charts where Trigonometry, Geometry and Calculus have been turned into Art, or simply click on the category as appears in the upper right white portion of this page, or at the bottom left of the page. \n 
 For best results, finish other installations and building projects before you install the floor to avoid damaging it. Bamboo planks may expand or warp if exposed to excessive moisture, so this is especially important for "wet" work involving cement or plaster., Move furniture out now while you still have the old floor to walk across. You will need to store this furniture elsewhere for at least 24 hours. If you are pouring a new concrete subfloor, which is not necessary for a typical floor installation, you may need to wait 60 days before you can put the floor in place and return the furniture. \n Remove any carpeting or rugs in the room, and detach the baseboard around the floor if present. If you have old flooring in place, remove it to expose the wooden or concrete subfloor underneath. Be aware that vinyl or asphalt flooring may contain asbestos, and if it crumbles at the touch, you should remove it with protective equipment and procedures to protect your health and safety. \n See also How to Remove Linoleum and How to Remove Floor Tile. \n If you are careful while removing the baseboard, it may be possible to install it again after the new floor is in. \n If the result is above 12% in a wooden subfloor or 75% in a concrete subfloor, the subfloor is not suitable for bamboo flooring.Consider installing a more moisture-tolerant floor material instead. Moisture tolerances for flooring material should be listed by the manufacture. \n New concrete subfloors should be left to dry and cure for 60 days after they were poured. You may not get \n If the subfloor and surrounding areas are not dry year round, the moisture could eventually cause decay in the bamboo or in the adhesive attaching it. If there is a large amount of mold present, or if you suspect the ductwork is faulty, consider hiring a professional.If there are crawlspaces beneath your house with exposed earth, you could reduce moisture by covering the earth with a vapor barrier such as 6 mil (0.15mm) polyethylene sheets., Vacuum or sweep your subfloor so it is clear of dust. If you are installing your bamboo floor with an adhesive, cleaning stains and spills off the subfloor is recommended so the adhesive sticks properly. Sand down paint or other coatings in this scenario as well, then vacuum up the dust it creates. \n Use a long level, or a level attached to a long string, to measure the floor in several directions and places. If any reading reveals a height difference greater than 3/16" over 10 ft. (approximately 5mm over 3m), you may have to alter the subfloor to make sure the bamboo flooring doesn't squeak or bend.Wooden subfloors can have high spots sanded down, but low spots should be cut out and replaced.Concrete subfloors can be leveled using a rented concrete sander to sand down high spots, and using a concrete repair mix to build up low spots., Use a tape measure to measure the dimensions of the floor and calculate the square footage (or square meterage) you will need. This measurement will be used to determine the amount of bamboo flooring you need to purchase. \n Once the room is free of dust created by the cleaning and preparation process, close the doors and windows so the room can reach a consistent temperature.Once the room temperature is stable after a day or two, it is time to purchase the bamboo. \n The ideal temperature for bamboo flooring is between 60 and 70ºF (16–21ºC), while the ideal humidity is between 40 and 60%. These measurements don't have to be perfect, but if the typical conditions in your room vary greatly from these numbers, bamboo flooring is not recommended. \n If the flooring is sold by number of planks, you'll have to calculate how many you need by dividing the total room area by the area of one plank. It's a good idea to purchase 5% more flooring by area than you think you need, since you may need to cut some of the planks to fit your space. \n Be aware of additional difficulties with concrete subfloors (see Nailing Down the Floor). The bamboo flooring salesman should be able to advise you on solutions that match your specific situation. \n Bring the planks inside and remove the wrapping. Wait for at least one day, and up to three, for the bamboo planks to adjust to the room's temperature. They may expand or shrink slightly as they do so, and the floor will fit better if you let the planks do this before you install them, rather than after. \n Avoid storing the planks directly on concrete or against outside walls, as this may affect their moisture content or temperature. Consider bringing a table inside and placing the planks on top of it. \n You cannot nail a floor onto concrete, so if you have a concrete subfloor, you may need to install a wooden underlay first. A more stable solution, though more expensive, may be to purchase floating floor materials. This includes a layer of foam or other material as an underlay, then click-together floorboards that do not require nails. \n If there is a room below the floor you are installing, remove chandeliers, ceiling fans, and other fixtures while you are installing. The pressure of the pneumatic nail gun could shake them loose through the floor joists. \n Leave a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) space between the bamboo floorboards and the wall to allow for any slight expansion of the floorboards. Place them across the floor joists, and start against an outside wall if possible to establish your line.Fit each plank together using the tongues and grooves. \n Using spacers is recommended. These are simply thin or wedge-shaped objects placed between the floor and the wall to keep them separate. \n Use a table saw or circular saw to cut the last floorboard to the correct length. Save the excess board to begin the next row. \n Drilling the holes before nailing reduces the chance of bending or breaking the board. Drill at a 45–50º angle from the side of the board, so the next row of planks will hide the nails. Make sure the holes you drill are smaller than the nails you are using. \n Each board should be drilled (and nailed) approximately every 10 inches (25 cm), and about 4 inches (10cm) from each end. Do not drill closer than 4 inches (10cm) from the end to avoid splitting the board.If your subfloor has raised floor joists, make sure your hole is over one of these so the board can be securely nailed. \n Test on a piece of scrap or defective bamboo floorboard first to see if the gun and nails are appropriate for your wood. If it "dimples" with a raised or cracked mark, test again with a different air pressure. \n Warning: put on safety goggles before using a nail gun. \n Nail the boards in place through the guide holes you drilled. A professional quality nail gun will minimize the chance of breaking your floorboards. The use of 18 gauge nails is recommended for securing bamboo floorboards., The second row should be nailed in the same method as the first, drilling then nailing from the side to fasten it to the floor joists. \n Use a rubber mallet to tap the row into place before nailing. \n Offset the floorboards by two to three times the width of the floorboards as you lay them for a uniform look. Work from several cartons of bamboo flooring at once, if you have more than one, so that color variations are evenly spread across the room, instead of clumped together., Once the first two rows are laid down securely, you can fasten the other floorboards using only the tongues of the board. Drill a hole directly above the tongue of the board, at a 45º angle into the wood. Keep a careful eye on the nail penetration and adjust air pressure if necessary so the nail head only penetrated just deeply enough for the groove of the next board to fit over it.Tap boards together with a rubber mallet before nailing, as before. \n Use a table saw or circular saw to cut the floorboards to the correct shape to fit the room. If there is a gap you need to fill that is less than half the width of a floorboard, pick up two or more floorboards and saw them to half their width or more so that, in total, they fit the space more closely. Sawing a single floorboard to less than half its width is likely to cause breaks when nailing. \n Secure the last two rows with additional nails to ensure the floor is well fastened. Once these are in place, you may use the floor immediately. \n Remember to leave a 1/2 inch (1.25cm) gap between each wall to allow for expansion. This can be hidden by replacing the baseboard molding, and by applying additional shoe molding if necessary \n 
 \n As you go throughout the process of learning your Eskimo roll technique, make sure that you maintain a firm grip on your paddle.\n You want to lead your paddle into the water on the right, or starboard, side of your boat. \n After you form this arch, you want to follow through with your paddle in the water all the way back to the stern, along the starboard side of your boat. \n A higher arch with the paddle will give you more power in your Eskimo roll. \n However, form takes practice. You’ll want to have maximum power without compromising your ability to pull the paddle against the resistance of the water. This is a personal balance, and it will depend on your upper body strength. \n \n Make sure that you have a friend or instructor near by to watch and provide feedback on your technique. You don’t want to form any bad technical habits. \n A large part of the success of an Eskimo roll lies in the fluidity of your motions. You want to be able to go through the motions of s roll without stopping to think about each position or step. \n Practice for a few hours over the course of a few days before you attempt to roll under water. \n The first time you do this, you’re going to exit the kayak rather than roll. To make yourself comfortable, ease into flipping over completely. \n Have your friend bring the bow of their boat next to your cockpit, perpendicular to your boat. \n Reach out one hand to rest on their bow. \n Slowly lean toward your friend, and tip your boat into the water about 45 degrees. Then, return to an upright position by pushing down on their bow. \n Repeat this a few times. Each time, slightly increase how far you lean into the water. \n Do this until you can lean far enough to flip yourself over completely. \n This will give you a safety net as you begin to practice your rolls. You’ll know you are never trapped underwater, as you can always perform a boat exit. \n Practice with the spray skirt on your kayak. You will need a spray skirt when you roll. \n Make sure that your spray skirt’s handle is within your reach, and that you are in a snug seated position in your kayak. \n After you capsize your kayak, take a second or two to orient your self, and remain as calm as possible. \n Grab your spray skirt by the handle, and pull it off. \n Place the paddle between your hands, firmly grip the edge of the cockpit, and push yourself out to either side of your kayak. Keep your head as close to the surface as you can. \n \n Each time you perform your exit, try to stay under water for a little longer. \n You want to have as much control over your breath as you can. \n Because you are new to Eskimo rolls, you may not be able to flip yourself back over completely on your first few tries.Remember, if you need help at any point, bang your hands against the side of your boat, or stick your hand up out of the water. \n Make sure your friend is on high alert. \n Once you capsize, your arm technique and paddle arch motion will be exactly the same as it was when you practiced on the surface of the water. It will simply be inverted. \n If you can’t pull yourself up on the first try, you complete the motion twice to practice under water, depending on how long you can hold your breath. \n Don’t be alarmed if you surface for a second and are pulled back underwater. You will need to exert a large amount of force to right yourself complete, and this takes trial and error. \n The only way to learn to do an Eskimo is to continue to practice. Don’t become discouraged and quit if you can’t get it right away. Eventually, the action will become natural and fluid. \n Experiment with different amounts of force and the height of your paddle. \n Don’t try to roll in a setting such as the ocean or a river until you are extremely comfortable with the action and have completed it many times. \n \n White water or ocean water can be too rough and unpredictable for those learning to do an Eskimo roll for the first time. \n If you are in a lake, avoid areas with submerged limbs or shallow areas with large rocks. You don’t want to hit your head as you roll. \n When you are learning new techniques, it’s best to kayak in places that you’ve been before. If you choose to kayak on a lake, try to pick a place where you know the landscape and are comfortable. \n You want to choose a familiar space so you are aware of all possible variables and dangers as you begin your Eskimo roll. \n Anytime you’re out on the water, you want to make sure you have a friend there for safety, especially when you are learning new techniques. \n If you can, recruit someone to help you who has kayaking experience and knows how to roll. They can watch your technique and give you personalized tips on improving as you begin. \n \n In addition to air temperature, check the water temperature, as the water is often much colder than the air. \n If you have access to one, wear a wetsuit.\n Practice holding your breath in increments, increasing the length of time you hold it. \n Do upper body exercises like push-ups and pull-ups to increase your arm power. \n For overall kayaking improvement, do core exercises like planking and crunches for better body control. \n 
 A good relationship with your teacher can mean recommendations to a university or even a job. Getting your first job is difficult without any experiences so you have to rely on your references. If your teacher likes you, she can be the reference you need.If you have questions about your career goals, your teacher may know contacts who can mentor you. For example, your science teacher may know chemists who can answer any questions you have or even offer you an internship.\n Your teacher may help you both find and apply for grants and scholarships. If you are having problems making friends or just looking for extracurricular activities, your teacher can help you meet new friends and pursue extracurricular activities to help you fill out your resume or college applications.If your school has study abroad or exchange programs, your teacher may be a great resource to help you fill out the application or find information about other cities and schools you may be interested in exchanging to. \n Your teacher may be a great resource to help you find community programs that suit your interests. You may also need your teacher’s support in order to run for a student office. Both cases look great in a college application or when applying for a job., Your teacher may be a valuable mentor, provide guidance, or give another adult perspective when you need one. Get answers to questions you can’t ask your parents, ask for advice or general help with personal problems., Do you not get along with your teacher because you dislike the subject she teaches? Your relationship with your teacher can be affected if you don’t find the class engaging. Think of the class as step to the finish line. Whether your goal is graduating or making it to a prestigious university, keep perspective to help you get through a tough class.Find the practical value of a class you don’t enjoy. For example, if you hate math think about how you can use it to calculate how much money you need to save each month to get you a car before sophomore year in college.If you don’t like a class because the subject is difficult, ask your teacher or parents for extra help. If you mention your difficulties to your teacher, she may be able to provide you with another perspective to get you engaged. For example, if you are having problems with history she may assign you a project to work with your grandparents in order to learn about their experience with the war they experienced growing up as kids. \n You can learn more than just homework and class work as teachers know more than just their subject matter. Teachers can help you become a well-informed and insightful person. There will always be at least one teacher who will stand out and change your life. You won’t know who that is until you make a connection., While you may find class or homework difficult, you can always put in maximum effort. Make sure to submit everything on time and be on time for class. When in class, be respectful, stay alert, and ask questions to keep yourself involved., Your teacher has an obvious interest in the subject he is teaching so the more engaged you become in the subject, the more attention your teacher can give you. If you have a genuine interest in the subject your teacher may also provide guidance in making it a career path., Get extra help, ask general questions about how to do better in school or how to get a job, or ask about how you are doing in your teacher’s class. You may find that your teacher is easier to talk to when not in front of the class.Do not ask for a meeting if you do not have anything prepared. You do not want to waste your teacher’s time or yours. \n It’s impossible to get your teacher to like you if you don’t show up to clas. If you need to be absent, make sure to let your teacher know in advance or email her as soon as you are able. When in class, be attentive and participate. You should be a welcome presence in the classroom., Even if an assignment is not due for several weeks, study to ensure you are prepared and keeping material fresh. Don’t wait until the last minute to study or complete an assignment as your work will suffer. Include studying as part of your daily schedule., Don’t slouch when the teacher is reading and take notes as you follow along. Write down any questions you may have and ask them at the appropriate time.Slouching or lying on your desk can not only make you tired but it can also be seen as disrespectful to your teacher. \n Finding a regular studying location gets your mind prepared to work each time you arrive. Make sure that there is no noise and minimum distraction so that your work can have your complete focus. Try not to listen to music, talk to friends, or eat at your studying place., Don’t try to cram a lot of information in long study sessions as your memory won’t be able to retain everything. A great rule is to study two hours for each hour of class.Studying three times a week for one hour works better than studying once a week for three hours as you’ll be less fatigued and be able to concentrate better at each hour long session. \n Schedule yourself to finish papers and assignments several days early. Give yourself time to revise them and ask for additional help at your school’s writing center if you have one. You may even get friends to read it or get guidance from your teacher., Use your teacher’s office hours to your advantage. Your teacher has office hours for a reason as he wants to help you succeed. Come prepared with questions, even if they are about assignments due later in the year., While everything can be found online, the library is a great resource to help streamline your research. Talk to the librarian to help you find books, papers, or other resources for your assignment., Ask your teacher for helpful study tips. She may give you specific chapters to focus on. Assemble a study group to help support each other and test each other prior to the exam. Studying early lets you find the most effective study method that works for you., School should not feel like a chore. A happy and productive student is a great addition to any classroom. Your teacher will appreciate you if you brighten up her day with your enthusiasm and attitude., School can be stressful so join a club, sports team, or simply participate in activities like free movie nights to give yourself some relief from stress. Check your school paper or community bulletin board for activities or clubs that you can join.Becoming a well-rounded student also helps with job and college applications as well as helps with social skills. \n Whether you have a job or are in a club, you should not neglect your studies. Extracurricular activities are meant to round your out as a person. Make sure you prioritize your schedule.If you have a goal to save money with your job, make sure you can handle your workload and don’t over commit. While money is a great incentive for hard work, it is short-sighted to place material possessions over education. \n It’s difficult to get along with everyone all the time. Your teacher is a person with a unique personality. Learning to get along with different people is an important life skill. Learn more about your teacher until you find some common ground and work from there.No matter what your life goals are, you will always encounter people that you don’t completely get along with. Learning how to relate to your teacher can be invaluable moving forward. For example, ask about where your teacher grew up or what hobbies he likes. He may surprise with similar music tastes or similar religious background. \n Any relationship needs respect so don’t expect to have a good relationship with your teacher without showing her respect first. Be polite and courteous even if you don’t agree with your teacher’s opinion. Be a responsible student and let your teacher know when you need to miss class or when you will make up for a late assignment.Don’t think your time is more important than any other student’s. Showing initiative and being responsible for yourself is a great way to keep your teacher’s respect and keep you in high regard. \n Teachers will resent you if you are being insincere with your efforts to make a connection. Your teacher will be able to sense if you suddenly change your demeanor after asking for a college reference or a job recommendation., Your classmates will resent you if your actions are phony and your teacher may call you out in front of the entire class if she finds your actions to be too much., There may be rules for your teacher not to accept any gifts but it’s find to show your gratitude if your teacher has helped you. However, if you give him something expensive or flashy, that could send a wrong message and get you in a lot of trouble.It is a teacher’s job to help her students and your education and well-being is reward enough. While material gifts may seem like a good gesture, doing well in school and growing up into a productive member of your community is exactly what your teacher hopes for you. \n You may question a grade or ask to retake a test but don’t do this more than once. If you continually second-guess your teacher, he will see that as disrespectful and come to resent you. If you always knit pick about points for a grade, you may wear your teacher’s patience., Your teacher may be affected by something happening in her personal life. Don’t be quick to judge if your teacher seems to be off. Your teacher may be cranky, irritable or unable to concentrate because of job stress, family problems, or health issues.Conversely, don’t automatically assume your teacher is going through personal issues. Your teacher may become offended if you make false accusations. \n If you constantly butt heads with your teacher, keep in mind your permanent record will reflect all the disciplinary action that you have received. This may make it extremely difficult to get into college or get a job., Talking while the teacher is talking can be very disruptive. In contrast, sleeping, doodling, or text messaging can also be distracting and is very disrespectful to your teacher. When you do participate in class don’t be rude or try to be the class clown.There’s a difference between participation and being obnoxious. While making your classmates laugh may be fun, there is an appropriate time and place., Let her know why you feel your relationship is strained. For example say something like, “I feel embarrassed when it’s like you're trying to single me out" or "I feel like you only ask the same people to volunteer." Try to work together to find a solution., If you don’t mesh with your teacher’s personality, get to know her and what she is knowledgeable about so that you find some common ground. There is a part of your teacher’s personality that you can use as a tool to help you learn. You will strengthen your relationship with her as you try to find that part of her personality., Perhaps this isn’t just an isolated incident. Talk to your peers and ask them for tips, tools, and create a plan to get along with your teacher. Sharing notes can help you get support and another perspective on how to understand a subject.If you’re too shy to talk to your classmates, watch what the successful ones do and try to mimic their actions. You’ll find that a lot of them ask a lot of questions and frequently participate in class. \n If you have exhausted all your resources and made a genuine effort to build a relationship with your teacher, ask your school guidance counselor or vice principal for help. They may be able to offer tips or act as mediator to help you and your teacher come up with a solution., Let your parents or guardians know that you are having problems getting along with your teacher. Let them know why you think your relationship is strained and what you have done to try to rectify it. Your parents or guardian may be able to meet with your teacher and better express how you’re feeling., If you encounter and physical or verbal abuse, like racist or sexual comments, report it immediately to your principal, parents, and even police. If your teacher is making you uncomfortable in any way you do not need to put up with it.Don’t keep your safety and well-being at risk or the safety and well-being of other students at risk by remaining silent.

 Depending on your grade, your report card may have information that doesn't fall into the typical A or B in math or science category. Your report card may show social skills or work habits, like pays attention or talks too much. It may also give grades like S, N, or D for satisfactory, needs improvement, or developing.Make sure to ask your teacher to explain any unclear parts of your report card. You want to be able to explain your grades to your parents as knowledgeably as possible. \n Know what your grades are based on. Have you only had one test you bombed, or have you had 5 tests this grading period? How many quizzes, tests, and homework assignments are included?You might also want to gather together some of your tests, quizzes, and homework so you can go over them with your parents. \n Another thing to think about is what kind of report card this is. Some schools give report cards every 9 weeks to show the student's progress through the semester. These 9 week report card grades are not the ones that will be put down into your records; they can be improved. If your school does semester report cards, the report card you get that lists the grades for the entire semester is important because these are the grades that will go into your records and stay with you. Make sure you understand how your school does report cards and which ones are temporary and permanent.\n Write down all the reasons you can think of for why you got bad grades in the classes you struggled in. One of the first things your parents might ask you is why this happened, so have an answer ready for your parents. Be honest in your self-evaluation. Some reasons for why you’re not doing well in a class might be: \n You sit next to a friend and get easily distracted. \n You find the teacher boring and fall asleep in class. \n You like to relax or have fun after school instead of doing your homework. \n You don’t like the subject matter, so you don’t pay attention. \n You understand the material pretty well, but you have test anxiety that drags down your test scores.You’re trying your best and paying attention, but you can’t keep up. \n The teacher doesn't prepare you well enough for the quizzes and exams. Are other people struggling in this class, too? \n You’ll probably know that your report card is going to be bad before you get it, so talk to your teachers before report-card day to get your improvement plan under way. Be honest with your teachers about your reasons for struggling in the class. \n Ask if there is any extra credit you can earn through extra work. \n Ask what they think the problem is with your performance. Teachers have a lot of experience with struggling students; they might be able to see some problems in your performance that you wouldn’t even be able to recognize as problematic. \n Ask for advice on how to better understand the material. \n Remember to use all the information and ideas you came up with in your self-evaluation and your conversation with your teacher to figure out how to do better during your next grading period.By approaching your parents with a plan for improvement, you’ll show them that you understand that you made a mistake and, more importantly, that you’re mature enough to take steps to fix the situation. This will likely make them trust you more when you promise to improve your grades. Some ways to improve your grades might be to: \n Stay after school for tutoring with the teacher. \n Do the extra credit you discussed with your teacher. \n Sit somewhere where you can’t see or talk to the friend who distracts you in class. \n Make sure you get enough sleep every night and eat a good breakfast that gives you the energy to stay awake all day.Come up with a list of ways that the information covered in this class will be useful to you later in life. You may not want to be a mathematician when you grow up — maybe you want to be a writer. But you still need to get good grades in math to get into college! \n You might be the kind of person who needs to work all in one stretch, so make a schedule where you start homework the second you get home from school, then relax for the rest of the evening. If you’re always burned out by the time school ends, then give yourself an hour or two of break time when you get home from school. Figure out what works best for you. \n The important thing is that you start your homework at the same time every single day. Routine is an important part of making studying a part of your life. \n Why are these grades important to you? What do you want to do later in life? Most students want to go to college and get a job. Do you know the kinds of schools you want to apply to or what subject you'd like to study? Knowing the scholastic expectations and what kind of grades you need for your colleges can help you figure out if A's, B's, or C's will suffice. \n Report cards aren't just about getting a grade. Report cards should reflect your hard work, improvement, and learning of the subject matter. You want to foster a love of learning, or at the least, an understanding about why learning and hard work is important., Though the impulse may be strong to just hide the report card from your parents, resist the temptation. Hiding your grades will point to your immaturity, while taking responsibility and approaching your parents shows maturity. Your parents may also be madder if you hide it from them, which is something you definitely don't want. \n Don't put off telling your parents, either. You don't want them to ask, "Why are you just telling me about this now!" or "Why didn't you tell me as soon as you got the report card?", Even if you approach a more understanding parent individually at first, eventually you’re going to have to talk to both of them together. By addressing them both in person, you show them that you’re owning up to your mistakes and are willing to have hard discussions with them. This will go a long way toward earning their respect. \n Tell them that you have some bad grades before showing them the actual report card. It’s easier to hear something than to see it in black and white, so the shock won’t be as jarring for them. \n When you talk to your parents, explain why you think you did poorly this grading period.This opens up a dialogue between you and your parents. You want to communicate to them that you are aware of your performance and your strengths and weaknesses. Show them the list you made and go through all the reasons together. Have an honest discussion. \n Don't provide excuses. Refrain from saying things like, "My teacher is mean!" or "It's not my fault!" Also, don't lie or deny what the report card says by saying, "I didn't know I was missing homework" or "I didn't know I talked too much in class."Take responsibility for your actions. This shows your parents you are mature, responsible, and willing to improve. \n Present your parents with the way in which you plan to improve your grades. Explain the reasoning behind your plan and why you think it will work. Write down the plan and give it to your parents so they know the steps you are taking.Ask them for their advice on how you could improve it further. \n Explain to your parents that you are not satisfied with your grade. This shows them that you are taking this very seriously.Don't just tell your parents that you are going to do better - show them. Giving them a structured plan of how you aim to improve shows them you are serious about improving. \n Knowing what you and your parents think are good and bad grades and comments can help you face your report cards. This also helps you understand their expectations of you. \n At the beginning of each school year, after a bad report card, or whenever you first think about it, you and your parents should get together and discuss what they expect your performance in school to be, what you expect your performance to be, and what you think you can achieve. This puts you and your parents on the same page, and gives you a mental idea of what you want to achieve. \n Keep in mind that doing well in school doesn't mean perfect straight A's. Not every student is a straight A student. For some students, their best is B's or even C's. Maybe A's in English is normal for you, but C's in math is an improvement. Strive to be the best you can be, but don't have impossible goals for yourself.Remember that as you move through school, the work will become more challenging. Don't freak out if you start making B's in a class you may have made A's in as you move to middle and high school. If this happens to you, explain to your parents that geometry was easy, but algebra and trig are much more difficult for you. Tell your parents that physical science was easier than chemistry., During your talk with your parents, point out the positive things on your report card. Even if you get some bad grades, it is important to focus on the good things on your report card. Sometimes, this might be difficult, but highlight any of your achievements. Did you get a positive effort comment from your teacher, or perfect attendance?One of the most important things to focus on are any academic achievements or improvements - no matter how small. Did you bring your grade up two points? Did you maintain your B average in science? \n Don't let the bad grades erase all the good work you did that is reflected on your report card. Also evaluate your bad grade - are you and your parents unhappy with your C in history? Is that C an improvement over your grade last term? If so, focus on the improvement and vow to keep improving it since you already have! \n Your parents were kids once, too, so don’t assume that they’re going to come down hard on you. They probably remember getting bad report cards themselves, and if this is your first one, ask them to be understanding. Remember, if you talk to them calmly and maturely, you will set a positive example. \n Stay polite and respectful, even when you get frustrated. When your parents get your news, they may be shocked and a little angry, but don’t let yourself get defensive or angry in return. \n Be willing to take the punishments they throw at you like an adult. \n No report card is the end of the world. There is always room to improve and to better yourself and your grades. Plus, you now have a plan on how to fix the problem! You know how to do better, so promise your parents and yourself that you’ll follow through. Improving your grades should be as much about yourself as it is for your parents. \n Don't get so discouraged and upset that you give up. Don't tell your parents, "I can't improve! I'm a loser! I'm stupid! This is impossible!" These types of thoughts aren't encouraging to your or your parents. Start by giving yourself small goals if the end goal seems too unattainable. Try saying, "I will improve my next quiz and test grade by 5 or 10 points." These small goals will add up to a noticeable larger improvement. \n Do you think that part of the reason you're struggling in class is that the teacher might be at fault? Be very honest here — don't just blame the teacher if it's really your fault that you're doing poorly in school. Blaming the teacher without a good reason will only get you in hotter water — both at home and at school. However, if you know that many other students in the class are struggling and that the teacher hasn't prepared you well enough to pass his or her exams, let your parents know that your teacher might be part of the problem. \n Suggest holding a parent-teacher conference where you are included. Talking to both your teacher and parents not only can help give you motivation and tips on how to improve, but it shows them that you are serious about your achievement.Be thoughtful in how you present this argument. Your parents might assume that you're trying to shift the blame, so give enough evidence to convince them that the teacher might be at least part of the problem. \n Promise that you won’t resent them for helping you stick to your own plan. Some other ways parents can help you study include: \n Explaining difficult concepts in their own words. Sometimes teachers and textbooks phrase things in ways that are difficult to grasp. Maybe your parents, who know you and how your brain works, can explain things more clearly. \n Helping you make flash cards for yourself. \n Quizzing you. \n Going over your homework to make sure you didn’t make any errors, and helping you correct those errors. \n Giving you extra assignments outside of school to give you more practice on the concepts you’re struggling with. \n You need to understand that your parents are very busy, and they may not have as much time to spend on your homework as they’d like to. It’s ultimately your own responsibility to study for school, so be grateful to your parents for any extra help they can give you. \n A private tutor will be specially trained to help you catch up to the rest of your classmates, but they can be pretty expensive. Don't hold it against your parents if they can’t hire one for you. \n If a private tutor isn’t an option, consider asking a classmate who’s doing very well in the class to be your tutor. This way, you won’t feel like you’re working alone, and your parents won’t have to spend a bunch of money on a tutor. \n Keeping your parents informed about your grades through the school year eliminates any surprises on the report cards. Show them tests and quizzes when they are returned. Another idea is to take time every weekend to go over the past week's assignments. This keeps you and your parents aware of your progress. \n Keeping up with your assignments can also help you to identify any struggles you are having. If you suddenly got a bad grade on a quiz or a test, you and your parents can discuss what might be the problem and figure out how to correct it. This helps you deal with any difficulties you have in school before they become a huge problem. \n

 For the purpose of this guide, we’ll call the router that’s connected to the Internet “Router 1” and the new router “Router 2.”\n To configure routers, you’ll need a computer that can connect to them via an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi. The operating system of the computer doesn’t matter. \n If you’ll be using Wi-Fi to connect to the routers, take note of the SSID and passkey for each router. You’ll need this information to connect to each router via Wi-Fi. \n If you plan to connect computers and other devices to the network without Wi-Fi, you’ll need an Ethernet cable for each device. \n For example, you’ll need one Ethernet cable to connect Router 2 to Router 1. \n If you wanted to connect two additional computers to the network, have additional Ethernet cables available for each device (unless you plan to connect them via Wi-Fi). \n You’ll want to start wiring the network with the equipment turned off. \n \n The WAN port may be labeled “Internet.” \n \n If you’d prefer to connect the computer to the router wirelessly, use your router’s instructions to do so. \n Wait a few moments for them both to come back up. \n You’ll need a web browser to connect to the admin interface of Router 1. \n This address is printed somewhere on Router 1. \n Here are some default IP addresses for common router brands: \n 2Wire: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.254, 10.0.0.138 \n Apple: 10.0.0.1 \n Belkin: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1 \n Dlink: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.101, 192.168.0.30, 192.168.0.50, 192.168.15.1, 192.168.254.254, 192.168.1.254, 192.168.0.10, 192.168.15.1, 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1, 10.90.90.90\n Netgear: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.227, These credentials, like the IP address, can be found printed on Router 1. \n If there is no username and password combination printed on your router, search the internet for “default router password for ”. \n If you’re using the right password but still can’t connect, reset the router to its default settings by inserting the end of a paperclip into its “reset” port.\n The DHCP settings are located in different places across different types of routers, but you’ll usually find them under “Network settings,” or “LAN settings.” \n In most cases, the DHCP server is turned on by default. \n Visit any website (like https://www.wikihow.com) to verify that you can connect to the Internet. Make sure that the physical configuration of your network leaves room for one LAN port to be open on Router 1. \n Everything else can remain on and plugged in. \n Now you’ll configure Router 2 as a second router on the same subnet. This means all devices on the network will be able to access each other. \n Just as when you logged into Router 1 as an administrator, you’ll need to do this to Router 2. Log in to the router’s admin interface using your credentials. Check and see what the IP is; most routers default to 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 10.0.0.1. \n Locate the DHCP settings (as you did earlier for Router 1) and switch the DHCP server to “Off.” \n That needs to change. \n Find the area in the router admin website called “LAN” or “Local Network.” There should be a blank that contains the current IP address (the one you connected to in your web browser). \n Type a new IP address in place of the existing one. The new address must be on the same subnet as Router 1, meaning the first three sets of numbers (out of four) in the IP address must be the same as Router 1. It also can’t be an IP currently assigned to another device. \n If Router 1’s IP address is 192.168.0.1, for example, Router 2 can be 192.168.0.100. Since the computer is the only other device on the network, there’s little risk for an IP address conflict. \n If it is, assign it the same SSID (the name of the Wi-Fi access point) and passkey as Router 1. \n You should find these settings under a menu called something like “Wireless” or “Wi-Fi setup.” \n If you’re unsure of Router 1’s SSID and passkey, it should be printed on the device. \n Now that Router 2’s all set up, it’s a good idea to give it a restart—though, for now, leave the power unplugged instead of turning it right back on. \n Make sure you’re not plugging it into the WAN port (they look similar). \n When the router comes back up, it will have the IP address you configured. As long as Router 1 has Internet access, Router 2 will now also be online. \n Router 1’s DHCP server will automatically assign each device its own IP address in the same subnet. Enjoy your expanded network! \n 
 You'll need the Calibre Companion  app as well as an ebook reader app installed in order to sync and read your ebook library. \n There's a free version called CCDemo and the paid Calibre Companion app. The free version allows you to sync up to twenty books at a time, while the paid version has no restrictions. \n Calibre Companion is not an official app, but it is developed by one of the calibre developers and is recommended by the calibre development team. \n Calibre Companion and CCDemo are the only calibre apps that work with this method. \n Before shelling out for the paid version, use CCDemo to test your network. \n The rest of the guide will refer to the app as Calibre Companion, but the process is the same for both the free and paid versions. \n The Calibre Companion app only syncs your ebooks from your computer to your Android.

 Free radicals in your stomach can break down your stomach lining, making your ulcer worse.Antioxidants are known as free radical scavengers — they destroy the free radicals that could cause you harm. Because of this, you should eat foods that contain antioxidants. These include:Red wine \n Pomegranate juice \n Grape juice \n Buckwheat \n Barley \n Beans and lentils \n Nuts (walnuts, peanuts, hazelnuts, almonds, etc.) \n Chocolate \n Berries (blueberries, cranberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, etc.) \n Certain spices (including clove, allspice, cinnamon) \n Certain herbs (including peppermint, oregano, thyme, sage, rosemary) \n Tomato products (sauces, sun-dried tomatoes)\n Flavonoids are found in many plants and are defined as organic compounds of biological pigments. Flavonoids also fight free radicals, meaning they are protectors of your stomach lining, just like antioxidants.Foods rich in flavonoids include: \n Blueberries \n Strawberries \n Peaches \n Apples \n Oranges \n Celery \n Black beans \n Black, green, and oolong teas \n Beer \n While it is an uncommon drink, cabbage juice is very effective in curing stomach ulcers. Cabbage is naturally rich in bacteria that produce lactic acid; these bacteria are essential in fighting and destroying the bacteria that causes ulcers.You should drink 50 ml of cabbage juice twice a day when your stomach is empty. \n Cabbage juice can be made at home using a juicer, or can be purchased from some markets and health stores. \n Research has also shown that cranberry juice is powerful when it comes to preventing bad bacteria from fusing to the lining of your stomach. \n You can drink cranberry juice, eat fresh cranberries, or take cranberry supplements (available from pharmacies and vitamin stores). \n Research shows that powerful wound-healing agents are found in white sweet potatoes.Eating these may help heal your ulcer. You can find white sweet potatoes at many markets and prepare them in several ways, including steaming and baking. \n Research and tradition demonstrate that honey is a powerful natural antibiotic. For this reason, it can help fight the H. pylori bacteria that cause ulcers.Try to consume a couple spoonfuls of honey each day to combat your ulcer. \n Licorice extract is available from many markets, pharmacies, and health stores. \n Talk to your doctor before starting a licorice regimen and discuss other medications you may be taking. Licorice supplements taken with with diuretics, corticosteroids, or other medicines that lower the body’s potassium levels could reduce potassium to dangerous levels.Take licorice supplements as instructed by your doctor. \n Research indicates that eating bananas can help treat the symptoms of stomach ulcers by helping to protect the lining of the stomach.Though it will not heal an existing ulcer, eating bananas may help treat your symptoms. \n Dried unripe plantains may also help, but ripe plantains do not seem to have a positive effect., When you would normally put a pat of butter in the frying pan to cook your eggs or vegetables in, you should instead use olive oil. These oils contain healthy fats that are processed more easily than the heavier fats found in animal products like butter.You can also try cooking with coconut oil, rice bran oil, sesame oil or safflower oil \n A bland diet concentrates on easily-digestible, low-fiber foods. These are gentle on your stomach and are less likely to irritate ulcers.You should talk with your doctor about whether or not a bland diet is a good treatment for your ulcer, and how long to follow it if it is. Foods you can eat on a bland diet include: \n Low-fat dairy products (milk, yogurt, etc.) \n Cooked, canned, or frozen vegetables without seasoning \n Fruit and vegetable juices \n Applesauce \n Hot cereals \n Lean, tender meats such as boiled chicken or baked fish, without seasonings \n Creamy peanut butter \n Tofu \n While alcoholic drinks like wine can have some health benefits, alcohol can irritate the lining of your stomach. When you have an ulcer caused by H. pylori, alcohol only makes the situation worse., Spicy foods might make ulcers more painful if you already have one, but they won’t cause one.It is best to avoid all spicy foods (hot peppers, hot sauces, etc.) if you have an existing ulcer or are predisposed to them. \n These fats are hard to digest, which can irritate ulcers. \n If you are addicted to tobacco products, talk to your doctor about treatments that can help you quit so that your ulcer can heal. \n These common pain relievers, fever reducers, and anti-inflammatory medications may cause ulcers in some people, especially if taken for extended periods of time or at high doses. If you are taking NSAIDs for an existing condition, talk to your doctor about other medications you can take instead (such as acetaminophen). \n If you are suffering from one, avoiding or reducing stress factors can help you heal faster. Meditation and breathing exercises are easy, natural ways to relieve stress and treat ulcers.
 Before the exam begins, ask for all mobile phones, electronic devices and textbooks to be placed on the teacher's desk. Have the students clear their desk of everything but their pencil case before you hand out the papers.\n If the desk are designed so two students sit side by side, sit on student at the edge of the desk, at a 90 degree angle to their usual position. \n They may be leaning in such a way that doesn't seem necessary for completing the paper. Observe them for a few minutes and, if you suspect cheating, walk down to them and stand behind them. You might see what they are cheating off, giving you enough evidence to cancel their test, and if you can't, it will still give them a strong warning. \n He/she might think that they can do whatever they want, but don't attempt to accuse anyone of cheating when behaving this way. \n Try to pay extra attention to students who talk a lot. \n Give them some papers to practice for homework. \n It could be basic questions on the topic. Be aware that shy students may seize up if you use this method and that, if it was a project, they are unlikely to remember exact details. \n Be very vigilant in the next test to see if their standard has improved or if they were lucky with cheating in the previous exam. \n 
 It's important to understand the dangers of the filter during use and installation to avoid electrocution.\n This is for the safety and will make the process much easier. You can leave the water, however you should clean any spills on the tank or near the electrical outlet. \n Using the diagram in the instructions, identify the parts. You may want to lay them out on the ground in groups to identify the pieces if there's multiples. It's important to have a clear understanding of the pieces before you begin. \n Ensure that there is enough room above the filter to open the top cover. \n Ensure that the vent is facing upwards. \n  Hold the filter by the sides and hold it in the desired position. When you have adequately positioned the filter, push against the filter to adhere the 3 suction cups to the wall of the aquarium. \n Installation should take between 15-20 minutes. \n This includes the activated carbon, poly/foam pad, bio-screen, and the c-nodes. \n Slide the "U" tube into place. \n \n Slide the chemical basket and the trickle chamber into the filter case. \n \n Insert the leveler into the bottom of the filter case. \n Mount the power filter onto the back of the aquarium. \n Adjust the leveler by turning it to the required setting to ensure that the filter is sitting perfectly vertical. \n Replace the cover. \n Allow a few seconds for the priming as the air is being removed from the "U" tube. \n Clean the media every 2 weeks. Maintain a water level of no more than 6 cm ( 2.25 in) below the aquarium rim. \n \n Read the remaining instructions. \n Unpack and identify all of the parts. \n Decide where the filter will be placed. For the best results, fill the aquarium with the maximum level possible. \n The filter lid must be located at least 7.8 in. (20 cm.) below the aquarium's water level, but never more than 4.9 ft. (150 cm.) \n For the best results the filter should be directly underneath the aquarium. \n \n Place one where the intake tube will be placed. \n Place the other where the output nozzle will be positioned. \n The rubber rings on the connectors are designed to help them adhere to the glass sufficiently. If the aquarium walls are less than 5/8 in. (1.58 cm.), replace the rubber rings with the 4 smaller suction cups that are provided. \n \n Connect the hosing to one of the two valves. \n Loosen one of the metal clamps and slide it onto one end of the hosing ( the rubber part ). \n Push the end of the hosing onto the valve. Push it as far as it will fit. \n Position the metal clamp over the rubber connector. Tighten. \n \n You will need a length that reaches comfortably to the canister. \n The hose should follow a straight path with no loops or slack. \n Place the valve end of the hosing at the approximate spot where it will be positioned onto the filter lid ( once the filter is installed ). \n Stretch the hosing so that it rests over the "output" rim bracket. \n Using a utility knife, cut the hosing at least 6 in. (15 cm.) beyond the aquarium rim. do not cut it too short! \n Insert it at least one inch (2.5 cm.) without twisting it. \n Ensure it is at least 3 in. (7.5 cm.) from the bottom. Adjust the intake tube for the best extension for the desired aquarium.When the intake strainer is positioned, lock it in place by pressing the suction cups against the glass. \n Fasten the intake strainer's hosing onto the rim connector using the 3 rim connector clips. \n Loosen and separate the 8 lid fasteners. Remove the filter lid and set it aside. Using the red T-handles, lift the 3 media baskets from the filter canister. \n Rinse the baskets and filter media under running tap water to remove dust. Place in the media baskets. \n Place the rinsed and filled media baskets back into the canister. Ensure it is placed the same way it was removed unless you are changing to a different filtration plan other than the one recommended. \n Stack the baskets, aligning them so that the shapes match. Reinsert the T-handles into their vertical slots. \n Replace the baskets in the filter canister. the foam in the upper basket should be about even with the top edge of the canister. The output tube will be protruding slightly. \n Move the filter canister into it's final position. \n Ensure that the purge valve is vertical (closed). \n Pour at least 2 gallons, (8 liters) of water into the filter canister. \n Place the filter lid back on the canister. \n Check to see that the filter lid seal ring is present and installed properly. Press the lid down until the output tube is firmly seated in the OUT connection on the filter lid. \n If the inlet tube attached to  the canister lid has slipped out of it's seat, re-insert it under the IN connection of the lid. \n Replace and hand tighten the 8 lid fasteners. The lid is properly closed when it is in direct contact with the canister. \n \n Grasp the intake valve (which is at the end of the hosing attached to the intake tube); slide it onto the IN connection on the filter lid. Press until it clicks into place. \n Grasp the output valve ( which is at the end of the hosing attached to the output nozzle); slide it onto the OUT connection on the filter lid.  Press until it clicks into place. \n Make sure both valves are locked into place and that the valve levers are in the open (vertical) position before proceeding. \n \n The automatic priming sequence will begin. \n The pump will run for one minute to fill the filter canister with water. \n The pump will stop for two minutes to evacuate air from the filter canister. \n The pump will restart. It will remain running until it is unplugged. \n This sequence will repeat itself when plugged in again. \n 
 This may sound like an odd thing to do, but your corn needs to sprout and putting it in a burlap sack will the sprouting process along. Once all of your corn is contained in the burlap sack, cover the sack with warm water. You can do this by placing the bag in a tub or large (super large) bucket., You will need to keep the corn moist for roughly 10 days. Check your corn for sprouts. When the sprouts have grown so that they are ¼ of an inch long, your corn is ready for the next step in the recipe., Wash your corn in a tub, making sure to scrub away any dirt along with the corn sprouts. If your corn has roots, scrub these away too. Move the washed corn to your primary fermenter. \n This is called making the mash. Make sure that each kernel gets thoroughly cracked. When you are sure all of the kernels are cracked, add five gallons of boiling water to your mash. \n When the water has cooled down to 86º F (30º C) add one cup of champagne yeast starter. Mix the ingredients together., When the water has reached the desired temperature, add seven pounds of rye grain, two pounds of barley, and one pound of malt. Stir all of the ingredients together., You will have to constantly stir the mixture. While stirring, increase the temperature of the mash by five degrees every two minutes. When the temperature reaches 160 ºF (71.1ºC), do not raise the temperature anymore., You will need to keep the temperature at 160ºF (71.1ºC) so that the starch turns into fermentable sugar and dextrin. This can only be achieved by continuing to stir for two to three hours. \n Let your mash cool down to 70ºF (21.1ºC). Add three grams of yeast and stir the mixture well. \n You can use a funnel to pour your mash into the fermenter of your choice. Many home brewers use glass carboys, which are essentially large glass bottles. You can often buy them with an air lock (which you will definitely need).You can also make your own air lock. To do this, drill a hole in your carboy cork or lid that exactly the size of surgical tubing (which you will also need for this method to work). Once you have drilled the hole, run the surgical tubing into the hole, letting the other end of the tubing hang down into a glass or jar of water. \n Once you have added all of the mash and yeast, you will need to seal your fermenter with an airlock so that absolutely no air can get in or out of your fermentation device. The process of fermentation involves the sugars in your mash, like glucose or fructose, getting converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide., The length of time you should let your mash ferment will depend on the recipe you used. It could anywhere from a couple of days to longer than a week. For the corn whiskey recipe listed above, let your mash ferment for seven to ten days. For the rye whiskey recipe, let the mash ferment for five to seven days., There are several ways to tell you can safely take your whiskey out of your fermenter. The best and most accurate way to tell if the fermentation process has ended is by using a hydrometer, though you can also do a visual inspection.Using a Hydrometer: Hydrometers measure the density of a liquid compared to the density of water. When the mash is done fermenting, the number reading on the hydrometer should stay the same. You should take a reading one time each day, for three days around the time when your recipe says your mash should be done fermenting. A good way to use the hydrometer is to take a sample of your mash by using a wine thief or turkey baster. Put this small sample into a graduated cylinder. Lower the hydrometer into the cylinder and gently swirl it around to release any bubbles. Take a reading right at the level of the liquid. This reading should be the same for three days in a row. \n It is recommended that you use a hydrometer to determine whether or not your mash is done fermenting, however if you really don’t want to buy one, you can try to do a visual inspection of your fermenter. Inspect the top outer edge of the fermenter. Are there any bubbles being formed? The day that you notice there are no bubbles forming, give your mash one more day to ferment and then move on to the distillation process. \n The process of distillation focuses on separating the ethanol (alcohol) created in the fermentation process from the wort (or used mash). The goal is to get 80% ethanol and 20% flavors and water from the mash., For safety reasons, it is generally in your best interest to buy a copper or stainless steel still from a still making company. There are plenty of websites that have quality stills for purchase. If, however, you would prefer to take on the project of building your own still, you can learn how to do so here. \n Fermented wort is referred to as ‘wash’. To transfer your wash, you will need to strain or siphon your wash through a cheesecloth and then into your still. The cheesecloth is necessary because you want to allow as few of the larger chunks of mash into the still as possible. If you choose to siphon your wash rather than strain in, try to leave as much of the solid chunks in the bottom of the fermenter.If you do end up with some of the larger chunks in your still, its not the end of the world. You can leave them in there. \n Again, if you have made your own still and want to refer back to the wikiHow instructions, click here. Once the rest of the still is assembled, slowly heat your wash. If you heat your wash too quickly, you may burn it. Over the course of 30 to 60 minutes, bring your wash to a boil. \n On your still, there should be a thermometer placed right before the cooling condenser. As the wash boils, keep on an eye on this thermometer. When it reads 120º F- 140º F (50º C-60º C), start the cooling water for the condenser tube. Doing this will begin your distillation process., Once you have added the cooling water, the condenser will begin to drip. For a wash that is five gallons in size, you will want to throw out the first 50 milliliters (1.7  fl oz) (¼ cup) that comes out of the condenser. This first bit is called the ‘head’ and is the methanol boiling out of the wash. The head has a nasty flavor that you will not want mixing with the rest of your whiskey. \n Once you have thrown out the head, read the thermometer again. It should read 175º F-185º F (80º C-85º C). At this time, the distillate coming out of the distiller is the ethanol boiling off, or the “body”. This is the liquid gold you’ve been waiting for. You will want to collect the body in 500 milliliters (16.9  fl oz) containers so that you can keep track of your product., When the temperature has reached roughly 205º F (96º C), you will want to stop collecting the distillate. The liquid now coming out of the distiller is call the ‘tails’. This will also give your whiskey a bad flavor, so keep it separate from the body. \n After you have collected all of your distillate, you will need to let each part of the still cool (be careful--it is very hot). Once it has cooled, clean it well. \n Most whiskeys are aged in oak barrels. However, if you don’t have any oak barrels on hand, you can also add oak chips to your whiskey while it ages in another jar or container. Allowing the whiskey to age will give it that beautiful whiskey flavor that we all love. You can buy both charred oak barrels and oak chips online.If you choose to age your whiskey in a jar or other closed container, you will need to regularly open the jar to let the alcohol vapors escape as they would do if being aged in a wooden barrel (this escaped vapor is called the “angels share”). Let your jars breath once a week at a minimum. \n If you choose to use a barrel, fill your barrel with warm water first. Doing this will cause the wood to swell, effectively sealing off any cracks the wood might have. This is important to do or else your whiskey might leak out of your barrel. \n When making whiskey at home, the aging process takes a lot less time than commercial distillers take, as you are no doubt making a much smaller batch of whiskey. Because of this, your whiskey is more exposed to the wood of the barrel or chips, because there is less liquid vying for a spot up against the wood. Your whiskey will be aged in a matter of months. \n When aging whiskey at home, there is a chance that you might ‘over oak’ your liquor. To avoid this, sample your whiskey once every three or so weeks., To determine your whiskey’s alcohol content (ABV) you can use your distiller’s hydrometer. Keep in mind that a whiskey with 75 to 80% alcohol is going to be a relatively unpleasant thing to drink. In general, whiskey gets diluted to 80 proof, or 40% alcohol. To dilute, add water. \n Once your whiskey has reached the taste and color you prefer, its time to bottle it. Store your bottled whiskey or enjoy it immediately, the choice is yours. Enjoy! \n 
 Google something like "high school exchange programs to China", and hopefully you'll get a few hits of agencies that place students from the US in other countries, or the other way around.\n Most exchange program agencies require students to be a minimum age of 15, and some require you to have a GPA of at least 2.8 to be able to apply. \n Trimesters are often much cheaper, and you can get a good "gist" of a culture by being there a few months (usually 2 to 3.) Semesters are usually the best, because you're not away from home from too long and you usually have enough time to get a great experience of the culture, take some interesting classes, and they're cheaper than full school years. Full school years would definitely be the most culturally stimulating of the options, and you'd definitely get an amazing experience, but it comes at a considerable cost, and you'd be away from home for a good while (usually 9-10 months.) \n Usually you'll hear back whether you're accepted or not accepted. \n Scholarships are usually given based on how high your GPA is, and financial aid is based on need. You could also do your part by getting a job (with reasonable hours) or fund raising. \n If you know the name of the school you'll be going to, research it online. Look into their classes, extracurriculars, and the surrounding city. This background knowledge will make you a little less nervous when it's time to leave. \n Usually you can get credit for the classes you take overseas, but if there's still a class you need to take that the school in your program country doesn't offer, take it before or after you leave. \n This will make it a lot easier to talk to them in person once you get there, and they won't seem like such strangers if you've had prior communication. \n Make a thorough check list of everything you'll need, and check it off as you go. As you'll be leaving for 3-10 months, you'll need to pack a LOT of stuff. Find the biggest suitcase in your house (if you don't have one, it might be a good idea to get one), and pack as much in it as you can. Be aware of any weight restrictions your airline has for baggage, and pack accordingly. Only pack things you really need (but of course things like books, magazines, iPods, and a few things that remind you of home are fine). If there is a weight restriction, try packing most of your things in a large suitcase you'll check at the airport, and packing the rest in a lighter bag you'll carry on the plane. \n You'll need a lot while you're there, and as it's a whole new country, it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to money. Your host family will probably only provide you with food and a place to stay, and anything else you may need will be your responsibility to get. You will want to get a few hundred US dollars worth of your host country's currency to start out, and also bring a credit card (for larger purchases) and an ATM card to withdraw bills monthly. \n This will also provide you with a way to make calls and communicate with people while staying in your exchange country, and it will help you feel not so far away from home. You can also communicate through email and letters. \n This is very likely a once-in-a-lifetime thing, so be sure to make the most of it! \n 
 Scaffold can be rented, or purchased if you will be able to use it for numerous projects. The basic parts of a scaffold system include these items: \n Scaffold jacks \n Stacking pins \n Leveling legs or base plates \n Braces \n Access ladders \n Scaffold boards \n Outriggers \n Various clamps and pins for assembly.\n There are a number of specialty rental companies that engineer and even assemble and disassemble scaffolding for projects. Having skilled workers erect the scaffolding is critical for safety and productivity, not to mention avoiding a possible fine by safety authorities like the OSHA (USA) or similar safety regulators., The ground or surface it will be erected on should be as level as possible, and soils should be compacted and have sufficient drainage to support the scaffold, even in wet weather., Installing the first level of scaffolding correctly will make completing the scaffold easier, and ensure the finished scaffold system will provide a safe, stable work platform when it is finished., Ladders should be furnished for access to each scaffold level, and workers should be provided with personal safety equipment such as gloves, safety glasses, and fall protection during the erection process., You may find you are able to install scaffold jacks with a minimal number of boards at each level, but since in normal masonry work there will be work to be performed from each level, having a complete deck will make stocking materials and accessing the work area safer and easier. Some things to consider when installing scaffold boards are: \n Use appropriate boards. Usually, scaffold boards are 2X10 (5x25cm) planks either grade-stamped number 1, laminated veneer lumber, or pinned scaffold boards. \n Lap scaffold planks 6 inches (15.24 cm) on each side crossing the top rail of the jacks. Standard jacks are spaced 7 feet (2.1 meters) on center, so 8 foot (2.4 meters) or 16 foot (5.33 meters) boards are standard. \n Cleat or nail boards together if necessary, to ensure they do not shift or slip during use. \n Discard any split, rotted, or damaged scaffold boards. \n Fit scaffold boards as tightly together as possible so that the materials will not fall through cracks to lower scaffold levels during use. \n Handrails, toe-boards, and access gates should be installed before workers are allowed to work without fall protection, and materials are stocked on the scaffold deck., Depending on your location and work situation, government regulations may require scaffolds to be braced or supported before use. In the United States, the OSHA requires such bracing when a scaffold's height to width ratio 4 to 1 or greater. For example, a scaffold that is 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide has to be secured if it is 20 feet (6.09 meters) tall, or higher., Tags should be affixed at access locations and should include a daily inspection log that is signed and dated each day. Here are a few of the items which should be checked daily: \n Check the scaffold support sills for erosion, undermining, and other deterioration. \n Look for braces and support members which are damaged or have been removed during the previous shift. \n Check the condition of the scaffold planks, handrails, and toe boards. \n Make sure the work areas are clean and clear of debris. \n Look for any other obvious signs of damage or broken clamps, braces, or pins. \n This will allow the workers to adjust the working height between each level, and enable them to work more efficiently., Large projects, and projects where large amounts of materials will be loaded at intervals, should have an access tower attached to the main scaffold system so that the weight of these materials will not be a hazard, and access for workers can be maintained on the scaffold deck. Avoid overloading scaffold decks. As a rule of thumb, any time the scaffold boards sag more than an inch (2.5 cm) or so, it is likely that they are overloaded., This is generally done in the reverse order of the assembly, and care should be taken to manage all materials so that they can be lowered safely to the ground. Cleaning loose debris and using buckets or bags to contain the small parts will help prevent items from being dropped where they may be damaged or lost, or workers could be injured., Rented scaffold should be counted and returned to the company it was rented from, and any damaged or missing items should be reported.

 It's easy to become anxious around another person who is anxious.Make sure to take deep, steady breaths. You need to stay calm in order to help your loved one calm down too. You need to keep your mind clear as a person who is having an anxiety attack is in fight or flight mode and won’t be thinking logically., If possible, remove her from the environment that is triggering the anxiety attack. When a person is anxious, she believes she is in danger: anxiety is fear out of context.Taking her away from the situation she is currently in will help her feel safe. Sitting down will calm the adrenaline that is rushing through her body, and help take her out of fight or flight mode., If your loved one has been prescribed medication to take during an anxiety attack, offer it now. If you don’t know, ask him what his prescribed dosage is. It’s best to familiarize yourself with the dosage and contraindications of any medication your loved one has been prescribed. It’s also good to know how long ago this medication was prescribed and what directions the doctor has given along with it., Speak in short, simple sentences and in a calming, comforting tone. The important thing is to remind her that she is not in danger, the anxiety she is feeling will passand that you’re present and ready to be supportive. Reassuring things to say include \n "It's going to be okay." \n "You're doing just fine." \n "Quiet your mind." \n "You are safe here." \n "I'm here for you." \n Deep breathing alleviates symptoms of anxiety.Tell him to breathe with you. Tell him to inhale through his nose while you count to 5 and exhale through his mouth while you count to 5. Say, "We can take some deep breaths together. Put your hands on your stomach, like this. When we breathe in, we'll feel our stomach rise and fall with our breath. I'll count as we hold it. Ready? In... one... two... three...four...five... out... one... two... three… four… five..." \n Bringing the focus on present reality will help a person having an anxiety attack realize that they are not in danger.Help her focus on and describe her immediate environment. You can also ask her to name all the furniture in the room, then all the wall decor in the room, etc. You want to help distract her from her internal experience by helping her focus on her external experience. \n Some of the symptoms of anxiety attacks are similar to that of a heart attacks.If you’re unsure of what is going on or if your loved one has another anxiety attack as soon as they have calmed down, call professionals for help. A medical expert can best assess the situation. \n Anxiety may cause people to neglect their physical or emotional health, and you can help by suggesting that she do something if you notice she has forgotten.Self-soothing activities may be especially important if she has frequent anxiety. For example, ask her if she would like to get something to eat or suggest that she take a warm, long bath. \n When dealing with children, engage in relaxing activities together. Let them pick what they want to do. \n Not everyone with anxiety will have an anxiety disorder but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t need to be dealt with. Set aside 30 minutes out of the day, where your loved one can just have a good worry. During this time, don’t let him be distracted by anything other than worrying and feeling anxious. Encourage him to think of solutions to his problems. This technique is effective with children as well as adults and helps them gain a sense of control over their problems., Your loved one may tell you why she feels upset, or you may have been able to tell based on what set off the anxiety. Try saying how upset she looks, and recognize that this is hard. This lets her know that you care, and that you think her struggles are valid. Ironically, affirming her stress can reduce it."That sounds really hard." \n "I can see why that would be upsetting to you. It sounds like visiting your father can be difficult for you sometimes." \n "You look stressed. Your face is scrunched up and you look hunched over. Do you want to talk about it?" \n Hugs can bring comfort to an anxious person.You may try to pat his back, give him a one-armed hug or put your arm around his shoulder to make him comfortable. Only do what you and he are comfortable with. \n Always give him opportunities to decline. If he is dealing with sensory overload or are autistic, touch may make things worse. Or he may not be in the mood. \n This can be an enormous relief to the anxious person.Be accommodating, and don't question her bad days or unusual needs. Treat her anxiety like a fact that, while unfortunate, is not a dreadful burden upon your life. Recognize that her feelings matter, and treat her with compassion, anxiety and all. \n Be flexible. It may take longer for people with anxiety problems to get ready for events such as getting ready for school. Factor in this time and allow for delays. \n If your loved one isn't being treated already, seeing a doctor about his anxiety may allow him to get the help he needs. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical or biological causes of the anxiety.Once you know that the cause of your loved one’s anxiety is psychological, you will be in a better position to seek treatment. To give him a boost, you might suggest accompanying him to take notes, help him remember symptoms, or just for moral support. \n Asking others for help can be very encouraging for a person with anxiety problems. In fact, persons with strong informal support networks have increase their chances of benefitting from treatment for anxiety. You don’t have to do anything specific. Just knowing that there are people around with whom to talk to and share her worries with, can help a person with anxiety problems feel better., You can help them, and you can offer resources, but you can not cure his anxiety disorder.Any difficult symptoms or relapses are not your fault. Chronic anxiety changes the brain chemically and neurologicallyand this take time to heal.It is the responsibility of the individual to work with her doctor or psychologist and better herself. \n Living with or being friends with someone with anxiety disorders/problems can be taxing.Take plenty of time for yourself. You don’t have to feel guilty. Your needs also matter, and your emotional health is important. Give yourself alone time and be willing to set boundaries. Turn off your phone at a certain time every night, and don't take calls. Be available for two hours, but then go home to relax. \n It’s important to have your own friends and family to support you too. Having someone to talk to about to encourage you to be patient will prevent burnout and keep your stress levels at bay.Taking care of yourself and being in a state of well-being, puts you in the best position to help someone with anxiety problems., It can be helpful to turn to experts to learn more about anxiety disorders, mental health, and positive coping mechanisms both during crises and in the long term. A psychologist can help you deal with your own feelings about handling a person with anxiety as well as give you strategies for taking care of her. Anxiety disorders also affect caregivers’ health and relationship with the person suffering from the disorder., An anxiety disorder is more than temporary anxiety (worry or fear) that most people encounter from day to day and can become worse over time if not treated.This is especially important if you yourself have never had an anxiety disorder. \n There is a significant difference between feeling anxious occasionally, such as when you’re going for a job interview or meeting new people, and an anxiety disorder. Anxiety is a normal part of life.An anxiety disorder works on many levels: cognitive, biological, neurological and perhaps even genetic.An anxiety disorder will require professional help to be cured through talk therapy, medication, or both.This may sound difficult and with persistence, it can be done. \n Knowing what your loved one is going through can give you empathy and put you in a better position to help him. If you know what type of anxiety disorder your loved one has, familiarize yourself with the particular symptoms of that order. Anxiety disorders include Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia/Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, PTSD and Separation Anxiety Disorder. \n If you’re not sure if your loved one has an anxiety disorder, look up the different symptoms of anxiety. \n Anxiety disorders and attacks are not untreatable.You will be better able to help your loved ones during acute anxiety, when you know how to calm her down and alleviate her symptoms. Especially learn how to do breathing exercises and interventions that make a person focus on the here and now. (These are known as grounding techniques). \n 
 They can be found at: \n Party Shops \n Novelty shops and stands (like at carnivals) \n The toy aisle in some grocery and department stores\n There will probably be a label on it and sometimes a band to protect the string to stop it from firing when not wanted (in packet). \n (There are some fun things to do with these) \n \n You may need to use a toothpick or alike to thread some of the string through the small hole. \n You may also need to widen the small hole slightly. \n Although removing it should be safe as long as the string isn't pulled with reasonable force, they are explosives so still express caution while doing removing. \n Once you have removed the explosive there are a few ways to detonate it: \n By simply pulling the string from the rest of the explosive. \n By igniting the explosive directly with fire (instant ignition). \n By using a fuse (candle wick works) to lead fire down to the explosive. \n Although it is quieter than most fire crackers, it is still loud and could cause hearing damage., Firmly hold the body of the explosive and the string in the other., The small piece of flint inside should light the gunpowder immediately and there will be a satisfying "bang."\n Remove the wax part from the tin. \n Remove the wick and the wick base (you can use later this for the 'Fuse' method). \n Optionally, cut back the tin so only a small 'tray' is left. \n Alternatively you can hold it with hand protection on (gloves) but it is more dangerous. \n Don't expect it to work first time, but prepare for it to go off as soon as the flame touches it., Alternatively, for a faster burning fuse but a more dangerous method, dip the cotton string in oil, petroleum jelly, or other flammable substance. \n Let the flame get down to the base part of the explosive and hope for the bang. \n 
 After creating a bit of a network, send out a shout out asking for a variety of things. Some of them are: \n Location (e.g. for Geography) \n Temperature (e.g. for Science) \n An interesting historical fact \n Their opinion about something \n Anything, really! \n This makes learning based on up-to-date information and real people (with a real story behind it!) \n \n \n Use TwitterFall first. \n Type in a keyword ("communism", "appeasement", "poverty" - whatever) \n Then watch the results come pouring in using twitterfall! \n Then use Twittermap \n www.twittermap.com allows you to GeoTag users and their posts \n You therefore get an idea of where certain topics are being discussed most... \n \n Use www.historicaltweets.com \n This gives some great ideas about how famous people might summarise their ideas / experiences as "Tweets" in 140 characters max! \n Then...students do the same! \n Produce a Tweet dialogue between two opposing characters (e.g. King Harold and William the Conqueror) about a key issue... \n Summarise a topic / concept / viewpoint as a tweet; each student should be given a different one to focus on. \n \n First...Choose your theme \n Genre - Fairy Tale, Sports Story, Adventure etc. \n Give it a standard story opener and tweet this to your network \n Ask network to continue the story in tweets, collaborating with the previous tweets and following them via www.twitterfall.com or a #tag \n Then...students follow via twitterfall, choose the best ones and edit them into a coherent story \n Great for editing skills, story structure etc. \n Where will your network take the story? \n \n Set up a new Twitter account for your class - you will possibly want to 'protect' your updates. Invite parents to 'follow' you, and they can see what the class are up to from any computer (home, work, internet cafe...) at any time of the day or night. They might even tweet back now and again! \n \n Put up a tweet asking people to give you their location. \n Class first estimate distance from school, then use an atlas to gauge distance. \n Then using Google Earth - can place mark where they are and find out distances. \n Retweet results! \n Benefits: Gives class an immediate set of places and distances to research. They might be interested to find out where people are and who they are! \n \n Give children individually the Twitter 140 characters rule - they have to write story introduction, character description or whole story. \n Results can then be posted onto Twitter or via blogs \n In groups tell children they are to play pass it on - but must do this in only Twitter 'speak' 140 characters. \n They then add to it around the group and can be shared in same way! \n One place that does that is twtpoll.com \n How do adult opinions differ from the views of the class? \n Use a Twitter poll to collect and graph opinions about a controversial issue. \n Is the student's writing clique or lacking descriptive language? \n Use Twitter to send out a word and have your network give the students synonym and other meanings, thereby testing the literacy strength of your PLN. Or have classrooms connect during writing workshops. Then have the students help each other create Wordle clouds of a word and the words that are synonyms, antonyms, and examples to foster stronger and more descriptive writing. The Wordle clouds become help posters during writing for the rest of the year. \n \n Find someone in another class, school, country who is interested in the same topic you are. Following each other on Twitter, share information, resources and ideas. \n Help each other find answers or even suggest questions \n Example - Rain Forest \n Primary class, primary teacher, class from special school, teacher (special), secondary class, secondary teacher and subject expert all linked via Twitter \n Sharing resources/learning with others is easy and context specific \n Primary/special pupils can tweet questions to secondary pupils who can either answer from prior knowledge or investigate. Subject expert able to make sure all is correct \n Twitter quiz set by secondary pupils as plenary activity for special/primary pupils \n \n Challenge your class to find the teachers who have replied. \n Try to gather some evidence that you have found them - name on football pitch, distinct shape of building - something to prove they have been found. \n Reply with this info. \n Use different Google Earth layers of information to help with the search. \n Gives a great real purpose to the use of Google Earth \n \n In the past, try commenting on questions, like "What does WATER means to them?" and "What does a new term mean to you?" \n With a global, if somewhat still limited, perspective we were able to talk about how world climate differences can influence such a commodity. \n Ask you network to comment on the issue you are discussing and to ensure they provide where they are. \n \n Post 8 letters and see how many words can be made from it (anagram) \n Post a word. Have the students find its antonyms, homonyms, synonyms. \n Use www.twtpoll.com to poll students about definitions. \n \n While they work on assignments, stimulate your students to tweet and reply about: \n Stuff they learn \n Difficulties they face \n Tips they want to share \n Great resources they find \n In this way, Twitter replaces the students logbook \n When learning about probability and the language of chance in mathematics, use your Twitter network to offer a real world response to your questions. \n "What are the chances you will see a deer today?" \n "What are the chances it will snow where you are?" \n With a variety of people in different locations you will hopefully have a variety of different responses. \n This has been used successfully for a few years now in my maths lessons, and the different language used in replies provides a great teaching opportunity. From "50/50" to "Buckley's Mate" ! \n Twitter replies could then be captured, added to a IWB notebook and placed on a probability scale or indeed a map of the origin, sparking further discussion about how this affects the probability of different events. \n \n Try creating a fictional alter-ego in Twitter who would develop as a 'character' who had a backstory. \n After this has been developed, they could be 'introduced' to classes, who could follow, and do activities based on past tweets. \n 
 According to standard MLA formatting rules, a cover page, or separate title page, is not necessary and should not be added to most papers. \n With that in mind, sometimes an instructor will ask students to create a cover page for an MLA style paper, especially for long papers. There are guidelines concerning the type of information that should be included in this event.\n Your title should be centered and typed one-third of the way down from the top of the page.The title of your page should be informative yet creative. \n If you include a subtitle, type it on the same line as the title and separate the two with a colon after the title. \n The first letter of every major word should be capitalized. Do not capitalize minor words, like “the,” “and,” or “to,” unless they are the first word of the title or subtitle. \n In the middle of the page, still centered, you should type your name proceeded by the word “By.” \n Type “By” on one line, hit the “Enter” key on your keyboard, and type or full name on the following line. \n Your name should be in FirstName LastName format. \n Two-thirds down from the top of the page, you should include this block of essential information about the assignment itself. \n Type the class and section number on one line. \n On the line immediately after, write the instructor's name. \n On the final line, type the date your paper is due in Month Numerical Day, Numerical Year format. \n The top, bottom, left, and right margins should each be 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. \n For most word processing programs, you can change the margins by heading into the "Page Layout" settings, usually located under a "File" menu. There should be a "Margins" heading in the dialog box. From there, change each margin to the appropriate size. \n From the first page on, your entire paper should be double-spaced. Note that you do not need to include any extra space at the end of a paragraph. \n For most word processing programs, you can change the spacing by going into the “Page Layout” settings, typically accessed from a “File” menu.” There should be a “Line Spacing” heading in the dialog box. Under that heading, select “2.0” spacing. \n The preferred font and size for MLA papers is 12-point Times New Roman. \n If you opt to use another font instead of Times New Roman, choose a font that is simple, easy to read, and not excessively large. \n A running header will appear on each page in the same spot. It should include your last name and the page number of each page, and should be positioned in the upper right corner of the page. \n Access the "Header and Footer" tool in your word processor, often found under the "View" menu. Type your last name and hit the page number icon in the options box to automatically insert the current page number on its corresponding page. \n The heading essentially includes all the information a cover page would include when used. Type your full name, instructor's name, course name, and due date in the upper left corner. \n Type your full name FirstName LastName on the first line. \n On the next line, type your instructor's title and name. \n On the third line, type the the class course number. \n Include the date your assignment is due on the last line. It should be in Numerical Day Month Numerical Year format. \n On the line immediately following the date, you should type your paper's title. This title should be centered. \n Do not make the title larger, italicized, underlined, or bold printed. \n The title of your page should be informative yet creative. \n If you include a subtitle, type it on the same line as the title and separate the two with a colon after the title. \n The first letter of every major word should be capitalized. Do not capitalize minor words, like “the,” “and,” or “to,” unless they are the first word of the title or subtitle. \n On the line immediately following the title, left-align your text and begin writing the introduction paragraph of your paper. \n The first line of each paragraph must be indented by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). \n Indent the first line by hitting to “Tab” key on your keyboard. \n You do not need to separate paragraphs with extra line spacing. This indentation alone is enough to mark the start of a new paragraph. \n If your paper is long, your instructor may request that you separate certain portions of it into various section headings. \n The recommendation for section headings under the MLA style is to number each section with an Arabic number and a period. Follow the period with a space before typing the section name.The first letter of each word in the section name should be capitalized. \n Section headings should usually be centered on the page and given their own separate lines. \n When you include a table or figure in your MLA paper, center the figure and provide a figure number, label, and source information. \n Use "Fig. 1," "Fig. 2," etc. for illustrations and photographs. Use "Table 1," "Table 2," etc. for tables and charts. \n Quickly label the figure with a descriptive term like "cartoon" or "statistical table." \n Provide the creator's name, the source the figure was published in, the date of publication, and the page number. \n All of the information should be included on a single line below the picture. \n Whenever you include a direct quote, paraphrase, or summary in your paper, you must cite the source of that material in parentheses after the material is presented. \n When the information is available, include the author's last name and the page number from which the material came. \n If the materials came from an online source and no page number is available, you only need to include the author's name. \n If no author's name is available, include an abbreviated portion of the source material's title. \n Note that if you introduce the author's name earlier in the sentence, you do not need to include the name in the parentheses, as well. \n Most quotations will be “in-line,” meaning that no special formatting is required and they can be treated as normal text. \n Always include a quote as part of another sentence. Never write a “hanging quote,” a type of quotation in which only the quote is presented without any lead in. \n Commas and periods should follow the parenthetical citation, and the parentheses should fall outside of the ending quotation marks. \n Quotes that are longer than three lines should be separated from the rest of the text in the form of a block quote.After you type the last word that comes before your quote, hit the "Enter" key to move to a new line. \n Each line of a block quote should be indented another 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in. \n You do not need to include quotation marks for a block quote, but you still need to include a parenthetical citation. \n Do not italicize, bold, or underline this heading.If you inserted any notes into your document, the notes themselves should be included as endnotes that are listed on a separate page after the main body of the paper. Do not include them as footnotes, which are listed at the foot of each page as they appear. \n If you inserted your endnotes using an endnote tool on your word processor, the numbering should already be done for you. \n Otherwise, make sure that each endnote is proceeded by an Arabic number that corresponds to a number places in the section of the paper's body that relates to the information provided by the endnote. \n The first line of each endnote should be indented by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). \n Endnotes should be used to discuss information that does not coherently fit into the paragraph it relates to. \n Your endnotes should not exceed three or four lines in lengths. Avoid long discussions. Endnotes are not the right time to bring up entirely new points. \n Do not italicize, bold, or underline the heading. \n If including multiple appendices, label each as “Appendix A,” “Appendix B,” and so on. \n The information in an appendix should relate to the information in your paper, but it should not be crucial or essential to your argument. \n An appendix is a way to include related information without distracting from the main argument of your paper. \n Do not italicize, bold, or underline the heading. \n Your “Works Cited” page should include all the texts you directly referenced in the body of your paper. \n All papers written in MLA format must include a “Works Cited” page. \n All of your citations should be listed in alphabetical order according to the authors' last names. \n If a text does not have a known author, arrange that citation in alphabetical order according to the first word of the article or book title. \n \n Write the author's name in LastName, Firstname" format. Follow with a period. \n Italicize the book title and capitalize the first letter of each word. Follow with a period. \n Write the city of publication followed by a colon, and include the publisher's name after that. Follow this with a comma and the year of publication. End with a period. \n Type the medium of publication, "Print" or "eBook," at the end. Finish with a period. \n A standard journal article includes the author's name, title of the article, title of the journal, issue information, and medium of publication. \n Write the author's name in LastName, Firstname format. Follow with a period. \n Include the title of the article in quotation marks and follow with a period. The first letter of each word should be capitalized. \n Italicize the title of the journal and follow with a period. The first letter of each word should be capitalized. \n Write the issue number, followed by the year of publication in parentheses. Put a colon after the year and include the page numbers after this. Follow with a period. \n Finish with the medium of publication and a final period. \n 
 Speak to your pastor about your interest in becoming ordained. If your pastor supports your goal, you will be brought before a local board at your church. This board or committee will ask you questions about your interest in becoming ordained. \n You might be rejected if you express a mystical belief that God has chosen you to become ordained, if you suggest or imply that ordination would simply be a personal accomplishment, if you have few other professional options or have been unsuccessful in their professional life, or if you demonstrate an inadequate understanding about the purpose of ministry. You will also likely be rejected if you have a criminal history. \n To be accepted as a candidate for ordination, express a willingness to serve the church and congregation, demonstrate that you are personable and have strong people skills, and show that you are willing to work hard. \n Report back to the board periodically about progress you’ve made toward becoming ordained. \n Be completely honest with your church committee. \n After passing the initial interview, the church might assign you a spiritual mentor -- an elder in the church or another person with strong faith -- to help guide you through the ordination process. If you are allowed to choose from a number of different potential mentors, select someone who you can communicate easily and honestly with who will keep you energized and focused throughout the ordination process., You will receive a Master of Divinity degree from a seminary accredited by the Association of Theological Schools. You could, alternately, obtain a Master of Arts in theology, though this is not preferred. \n You do not need to attend a seminary explicitly associated with your denomination. \n If you do not like your seminary, talk to your mentor and church committee about transferring to another seminary. \n You will engage in part-time work to gain practical experience as part of the clergy. In addition to the internship, a shorter period of internship called a practicum may be required. Check your seminary’s graduation requirements for specifics. \n You will also need to undertake sex-abuse training to identify and understand sexual abuse. Use training materials provided by the seminary to prepare for these tests. \n You might also be given psychological and personality tests. \n You should also include some information about a specific topic or topics relevant to your ordination. For instance, you might write the main body of your ordination paper on a topic like “forgiveness in the Old Testament.” \n The specific format of your ordination paper depends on the requirements of your seminary program. \n Some denominations like the United Methodists and Evangelicals have a probationary period for their pastors. You might need to rack up four years or more of ministry experience before you are properly ordained.During this trial period, find your own voice at the pulpit and gain more experience in helping, preaching, and providing inspiration to your community of believers. \n Continue learning more about your role in the church and deepening your knowledge of the Bible through daily reading and reflection. \n You will also need to present personal references, some or all of which are from other pastors, deacons, or church elders. Talk to your mentor about the process in your church. \n

 A proper personal flotation device should be a jacket or vest that covers the chest, stomach and back. The life vest must be properly fitted so that it does not slip up on the body when falling. \n It should fit snugly but not be uncomfortable. \n Be sure to check the manufacturer’s label for weight limits and sizing information. \n You will want a pair of combination skis, which are suitable for beginners and have two skis with one ski having a half-foot binding behind the other foot. Skis for beginners will usually be wider and thus more stable on the water. They will be made for different weight ranges so it is important to pick a water ski that suits your size. \n Check the manufacturer recommendations for the recommended weight ranges for the particular skis you are looking at. \n Kids skis are different in that they are smaller and easier for small children to control. They will usually come with a “trainer” option, or when you tie the skies together to prevent the skier from losing their balance and performing the splits. \n The bindings will usually be adjustable for a range of sizes to fit a variety of people., Trainer skis for kids can often be tied together, preventing the child from doing the “splits”. Kids usually have a hard time keeping control over their skis and keeping them together so this can be incredibly helpful when beginning. \n A water skiing rope will have a little stretch only and be 75 feet (22.86 meters) long from the handle to the opposite end. Do not use a wakeboarding rope, which will have no stretch, or a rope that is too stretchy. \n The rope should be labelled and marketed specifically for water skiing. \n There are seven different hand signals that a skier should learn. These are important for signalling the boat driver while water skiing. \n A thumbs-up means go faster while a thumbs-down means slow down. It is important to remember this while skiing so that you do not accidentally ask for more speed. \n Bring thumb and forefinger together to signal OK. This tells the driver that the speed and path are good. \n Point your finger in the air and move it in a circular motion and then point to the direction when you want to turn a certain way. This can be used by the water skier to signal that they want to go a particular way or by the boat driver to warn the skier of a turn. \n Pat your head to signal that you would like to return to the dock. You can do this if you are tired and want to finish. \n A slashing motion at the neck means to stop the boat immediately. This can be done by the skier, driver or observer in case of emergencies. \n Clasp your hands over your head after a fall to signal that you are OK. This should be done after every fall., Many states require boats to have ski flags. These are usually bright coloured flags that signal to other boats that there is a skier in the water. Every time the skier is in the water and not skiing, the flag must be held up for other boats to see. \n This is an important safety measure and most boats will need an observer who is in charge of watching the skier and holding the flag., The proper stance for starting to water ski is called the “cannonball” position. \n While on dry land, put the skis on your feet. \n Hold the handle and bend your knees so that you are sitting on the skis in the same form you would use to complete a cannonball. \n Have someone pull gently on the other end of the rope to help pull you up into into a chair position. You will look like you are sitting in a chair, even though there is not one. \n Make sure your knees stay together at all times and that you keep your arms straight to allow the rope to pull you up., The most important aspect of pulling a water skier is to start quickly, or have a lot of torque. This means that you must have a relatively strong boat and that you start from zero very quickly. This will help the water skier to get up on their skis smoothly. \n It is very important that the driver pull steadily to ensure a smooth ride for the water skier. If they change speeds or turn suddenly it can be very difficult for a beginning water skier to maintain balance. \n Usually early morning works best when water skiing because that is when the water is at its calmest. Later in the day there may be more traffic and thus rougher waters. \n If you do hit rough water or wakes, then you should hit them at a 90 degree angle to minimize the bumps for the water skier. \n It is important to make water skiing fun for kids so try to pick a time which is suitable for everyone when teaching them. \n Speeds will vary according to the size and experience level of the skier but there are general guidelines for water skiing. Kids should be pulled as slow as possible while keeping them out of the water. The speeds described here are for water skiing on two skis only. \n Water skiers who are less than 50 lbs. (<23 kg) should be pulled at about 13 mph (21 km/h). \n Water skiers who are 50-100 lbs. (23-45 kg) should be pulled at about 16 mph (26 km/h). \n Water skiers who are 100-150 lbs. (45-68 kg) should be pulled at about 18 mph (29 km/h). \n Water skiers who are 150-180 lbs. (68-82 kg) should be pulled at about 21 mph (34 km/h). \n Water skiers who are more than 180 lbs. (>82 kg) should be pulled at about 24 mph (38 km/h). \n Adjust your speed on turns. If the skier is on the inside of a turn then they will slow down and you may need to speed up. If they are on the outside of the turn they may speed up and you may need to slow down., You can easily slingshot a water skier on a turn so it is important to make sure that you keep far enough away from any docks or obstacles. Additionally, if a skier lets go they can travel quite far before sinking into the water so keep this in mind. \n Do not go over any shallow water or where there may be obstructions just above or below the surface of the water. \n Most ski accidents occur from collisions with docks or other solid objects so be very careful about staying in open water., You should usually have an observer on the boat to help you watch the skier in case they fall or are signalling the boat. It will be difficult for the driver to watch where they are going and keep an eye on the skier at the same time. \n The observer will be the one controlling the ski flag and relaying signals to the driver. \n It is always good practice and safer to turn off the propeller completely when near anyone in the water. As soon as you get close, turn off the propeller and let your momentum bring the boat alongside them. \n Be very careful not to injure the skier when bringing the boat near. Do not come too close and always turn off the propeller. \n An EZ ski trainer helps kids get used to being pulled behind a boat before trying to get them up on water skis. This device is like an inflatable jet ski that will be pulled behind a boat on a rope. It also helps kids build confidence, learn how to hold the hand and maintain balance. \n The kids can sit or stand as they feel comfortable, learning how to balance and getting accustomed to being pulled behind a boat. \n Be patient with kids and allow them to go at their own pace. This trainer can help reduce some of their nervousness before water skiing., Sit on the side of the boat or at the dock and put the water skis on. They should be adjusted for your correct size and you will usually simply have to slip your feet inside to secure them. The foot should be tight so it may take a little wiggling to get your feet in all the way. \n It can help to wet the skis before putting them on, because it makes them easier to slide on your feet. \n Kids may need assistance with getting their skis on properly so help them when necessary. \n Hold the rope with your two hands next to each other. Both palms should be facing down for water skiing on two skis. Make sure your grip is secure and your arms stick straight out in front of you., Allow your personal flotation device or lifejacket to keep you on top of the water and lean back. Bring your knees to your chest, with your arms around the outsides of your knees as if you are hugging them. \n Bring the rope in between the tips of your skis with the handle between your body and the ski tips. \n While leaning back with your knees to your chest, bring your ski tips up out of the water, keeping your skis straight and close together. Water skis should be no more than hip width apart. \n Kids skis will often have a rope or other device holding them together. This helps keep their skis together to maintain control. \n With the rope between your skis and your hands holding the handle securely between your body and the ski tips, keep your arms straight in front of you. This is a very important aspect of getting up on water skis. \n It is very important to let the boat pull you out of the water and up onto your skis. \n If you try to bend your arms or pull yourself up out of the water, you will likely lose your balance and fall. \n If you are close to shore, someone can hold the water skier in their arms, keeping their skis together and helping them to balance while leaning back with their knees to their chest. \n This can be especially helpful for children, who may lose their balance or form while waiting for the boat to go. \n There cannot be any slack in the rope with the boat starts going or else it will jerk the water skier forward and cause them to lose their balance. Once the rope is in the water skier’s hands the boat can move forward at a slow pace until the rope is tight. \n The water skier may move slightly forward through the water while the rope is being tightened. Be careful to stay balanced and maintain your form. \n Yell “hit it!” to the driver to signal that you are ready to begin. The boat will start quickly forward. Keep your form together and stay calm and confidence. Being confident and relaxed is very important for getting up easily on water skis. \n It is more important that the boat has a lot of torque, or picks up speed quickly, rather than that it achieves a high speed., Keep your ‘cannonball’ form while leaning back slightly with your arms straight in front of you as you allow the boat to pull you up. The skis should be directly underneath you even though you are leaning back slightly. Do not stand up immediately. \n Bending your arms to pull yourself up will only cause you to lose your balance so keep them straight. \n Keep your eyes directly ahead. Putting your eyes and head up to avoid splash can make you lose your balance while looking down will likely cause you to fall down. \n Having your knees bent is imperative both before the boat starts and while you are trying to get up on skis. This will help you to maintain balance properly and better control your skis. \n Even if the water is quite smooth, there will always be small bumps so keeping your knees bent will help to absorb those bumps. \n If you are comfortable being pulled and are balanced, try standing up. While standing keep your feet and skis directly beneath you and simply straighten out your legs while continuing to lean back slightly with your arms directly in front of you. \n It might be best for kids to try skiing once or twice while remaining in the ‘cannonball’ form the entire time. This helps them to get used to water skiing and maintaining balance and control. \n It can be tricky to keep your balance while learning how to water ski. Be patient with yourself and keep your confidence. If you are getting frustrated you can give yourself a break and try again later. \n Covering your face with your hands when you float back up to the surface can help prevent you from getting banged in the face by the ski if it falls off. \n Hold up your arm or a water ski while the boat and turning to come back to you so that other boaters can see you and avoid you. \n Bending your knees will help you to absorb any bumps or wakes that the boat traverses, helping you maintain balance and continue standing. \n Do not try to pull yourself forward or maintain balance by pulling on the rope. You should simply allow the rope to continue pulling you forward. \n Lean back slightly with your hips forming a straight line with your shoulders. You can push your hips slightly forward and up towards the handle but make sure the skis stay directly beneath you. \n Allowing the skis to move to far out in front of you will cause you to fall backwards. \n Leaning forward will cause the skis to move behind you and make you fall forward. , Many skiers tend to hold their breaths while skiing but it is important to breathe naturally. Normal breathing will reduce fatigue and prevent you from getting overly tired. \n Try turning slightly by putting more pressure on the inside edge of the ski on the opposite side of where you want to go. Stay inside the wake for now. \n For example, you will push down on the inside edge of the ski with your left leg and lean slightly to the right and away from the boat to move to the right. At the same time you can lift up slightly with your right foot to help you turn. \n Make sure you keep proper positioning with your knees bent and arms straight in front of you while you turn., Make a turn to either side and cross the wakes by turning your skis at a sharp angle to the wake. Keep pressure on your ski closest to the boat until you are completely outside the wake. \n Keep your knees bent to absorb the shock. \n If you try to cross with one ski at a time, you will fall. Make sure you cross at a sharp angle to the wake with both skis at the same time. \n Going over the wake should be quite quick. If you try to go slowly, you will fall. \n Keep your arms straight in front of you while crossing the wake. Pulling on the handle is a common mistake made by beginners and can also cause you to lose your balance and fall.
 It is hard to find a dress worthy of Lucille Ball in a regular department store. You may want to devote a day to browsing vintage racks.\n They create similar looks; however dresses can run between $65 and $150. \n Most of these stores don’t have physical locations, so you will need to shop online. \n Lucy often wore patterns that popped in black and white. Ensure it has a full swing skirt., Both should be form fitting. The gingham shirt can be tied at the natural waist. \n Sling back or patent flats can also work. \n Chiffon fabric is the most comfortable, and you will need to measure it to the length of the dress. Lucy favored knee or just over the knee-length dresses. \n Although I Love Lucy was in black and white, she was well known for her red hair. She was likely to have been a natural brunette, but the red hair matched her trademark lipstick and outfits. \n Section the top of your head in a rectangular part along the sides and back. This will be the bouffant-like section. \n It is recommended that your bangs be at least three to four inches long to pull off the pin curl look. \n Tie up the rest of your hair so that it doesn’t get in the way. \n Twist one-inch (2.5cm) sections onto your head and pin them in place along each row. You should have three to four pin curls in each of the three front rows. \n Secure with two bobby pins placed like cross hairs. Try to make each of the bobby pin pairs identical on each pin curl. \n Pin curl a bottom row going clockwise. Pin curl a top row going counterclockwise. \n Cover the pin curls with a scarf. Sleep on them and wait until you are getting ready the next day to take them out. \n This way it will be out of your face. \n Take down the sides first, one at a time. \n Wrap them up into the bun and pin them in place, leaving a wave at the side. Repeat on the opposite side. \n Comb through the curls gently with your fingers, leaving them mostly intact. \n Roll them so there is a ringlet in front. Pin them in place, taking care to hide the pins. \n The curls should come out slightly over your forehead., If you are going for the full black and white star look, remember that she wore heavy makeup to get a flawless complexion. If you are going casual, this is not necessary. \n Use a brow pencil to accentuate the arches. Lucy had fairly heavy, distinct brows. \n You can also use fake lashes to get a more dramatic look. \n Lucy arched her lips slightly bigger at the top and bottom, between the creases. \n Fill the lips in with matching red lipstick. Powder the lips slightly to set them., Have someone help you into your dress at this point, so that it stays free from powder and hairspray. \n 
 Don't try to play without it!\n You should have some type of routine or comfort zone to get into the right mindset. You'll probably find you need to stretch out much more than any of the other players. Join in the player stretch-out then move onto doing some personal stretches. Make sure you stretch your legs very well because you'll use them the most. Don't forget the arms, they're important too! \n Shuffle backwards and forwards using small steps to get in the right frame of mind. \n There are a few different positions but the most important thing is to be comfortable in how you're standing. You should probably do some research to find out what all the styles involve before practice. \n Drills will usually involve you being shot at by players moving in, they are really to better the players rather than you but practice anticipating the play and keeping your eye on the ball. Games will be a bit more relaxed as you tend to have a team on your side as well. Always be aware of what's going on and keep yourself warm, skate on the spot, move side to side or something, as long as it keeps your muscles warm. \n Timing is another key asset of a goalie, you should never make the first move, unless of course, that's your style. Allow the player to move in on you and wait for them to make the first move and react to it. \n Remember just to enjoy yourself and keep focused. \n Your blocker-mitt should just rest naturally when you place your stick on the floor slightly in front of you covering your 5-hole (in-between the legs). \n

 \n Hold the thick end of the cue in your dominant hand with your palm facing upward. Find the spot on the wrap where the cue evenly balances. Grip your cue about 1" behind that spot. \n Make a circle with the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand. Put the cue through the circle and rest it on the top of your middle finger, behind the knuckle. Spread out your "pinky", ring and middle finger tips to create a tripod-like support. \n Place the ridge of your hand should on the table. Lift the other side of your hand a bit higher.\n \n Place the foot that is on the same side as your non-dominant hand in front. \n Position your other foot about 2 feet (60 cm) behind the front foot. \n Turn your body slightly away from the table so that it doesn't interfere with the shot. \n Position yourself close to the table but not too close to the table. You want to lean into the shots a bit for more control. \n Proper form requires the cue stick to be directly below your chin during a stroke. If you compare the form of a professional pool player with that of a novice pool player, the professional player will always keep their head down also known as "being down on the ball" with the cue directly below his or her chin during the stroke. \n Avoid twisting the chalk on top of the cue. \n Imagine that you are moving your arm through the water in a swimming pool instead of hitting the ball with a quick strike. A longer stroke imparts more momentum to the ball. \n The cue should continue on its course and almost hit the table ahead of the ball's starting position. Your cue shouldn't slow down until the tip has actually hit the ball. \n This position allows you to analyze the angle of the ball and the direction of every other ball that it strikes. It also ensures that you don't cause the shot to deviate by accidentally introducing a jumpy motion. \n Angle the cue so that it creates a parallel line from right above the cue ball to the target. \n Maintain the angle that you just made when you lined up the ball and the pocket. \n Pull the rest of the cue around to the right or left until the cue is positioned over the white ball. You now have the angle at which you need to hit the white ball to sink the other ball. \n Strike the center of the white ball so that it makes contact with the other ball. \n It will make you less likely to win the current game but more likely to win future games. Sometimes in pool, you get a shot that would be an awkward angle with your dominant hand, but your non-dominant hand will gain skill faster for those awkward shots if you play with your non-dominant hand all the time than if you just do it for those shots. In fact, skill transfers somewhat from one task to another task to your non-dominant hand will gain skill for pool faster if you you do everything with your non-dominant hand than if you just play pool with your non-dominant hand like in other activities. \n \n Choose a larger wrap if you have large hands and a smaller wrap if you have small hands. The most important point is to find a wrap that feels good in your hands. \n If your hands sweat, choose a cue wrapped in Irish linen for absorption. Otherwise, choose a leather wrap or a cue with no wrap. \n Most shafts have a diameter of 12mm to 13mm. While 13mm is the most commonly selected size, a smaller shaft can make the bridge position more comfortable for people with smaller hands. \n The shaft maintains its diameter for 10" to 15" before it starts to taper toward the cue. A shorter taper gives you a firmer hit. \n Most players choose a weight between 19 and 20 ounces. \n Most cues are 57" or 58" long, but you can special order different lengths. \n Cue tips are made of leather and generally rated medium to hard. A tip that will wear well gives you better control of the ball. \n Any loose parts will absorb the energy from your shots and will hamper your ability to strike the ball well. \n 
, If your horse has this but makes it past the first 14 days since infection he should be okay. \n Chronic: Chronic EIA horses go through the same severity of acute EIA horses but seem to recover after a few weeks. The symptoms then go away for weeks or even months until the horse has a relapse of worsened intensity, usually as result of being worked hard. Chronic EIA horses also can have rough hair coats, lack stamina, and be anemic. \n Carrier: Carriers of the EIA virus will seem to completely recover from the initial attack, yet still carry and can transmit the disease., A healthy adult horse's temperature while resting varies from to 99-101°F (37.2 - 38.3°C), while fever associated with EIA can range from 105-108°F (40.5 - 42.2°C). \n The fever of an EIA-infected horse can either be highly intermittent or continuous. It may help to take your horse's temperature several times throughout the day.\n This can be checked by placing the hand under the horse's left elbow. Count the beats for 10 seconds then multiply the beats by 6 to get the heartbeat number per minute. A normal heart rate is 35-40 beats per minute. \n Irregularity may be a sign of infection with EIA. \n A healthy horse likes his food and while eat it nearly as soon as you offer it. A horse that refuses food or has a reduced appetite, however, may have EIA. \n Don't be concerned unless there has been no change of diet and your horse has had rapid or chronic weight loss. \n Tiredness and depression are also signs of EIA. \n Swelling is another sign of the horse having EIA. \n Similar diseases include Piroplasmosis, African Horse Sickness, Anthrax, Dourine, Equine Viral Arteritis, Japanese Encephalitis, Equine Influenza, Equine Herpes Virus, and Babesiosis. \n He should be able to give you advice and confirm your horse's symptoms. \n This test is fairly inexpensive and only requires a certified vet sending a sample of your horse's blood to a lab. Usually the process takes 3-5 days. \n A negative Coggins/EIA test result means your horse is not a carrier of the disease. If your horse continues having symptoms, tell your vet; your horse may be sick with something else. \n A positive Coggins/EIA test result means your horse is an EIA carrier. If you feel the test was a false positive you can ask your vet to retake the Coggins, though you will need to pay for the test again. \n This will reduce the potential of EIA spreading throughout the area. \n Some areas say area of exposure is within proximity of 200 yards (180 meters) of the infected horse, other areas say within proximity of 3 miles (4.8 kilometers). \n Legally you only have three choices: Keeping your horse at a quarantine facility for the rest of its life, having the horse euthanized, or selling the horse for immediate slaughter. \n There aren't many quarantine facilities, but one of the largest ones, Florida Research Institute for Equine Nurturing, Development and Safety, is located in Southern Florida. \n Large-mouthed flies such as deer-flies and horseflies will quickly spread the EIA virus by mechanically sharing an infected horse's blood with other horses. \n Regularly clean and muck stalls/pens around the barn, depositing the manure a good distance away. \n Eliminate any standing water; flies use these as breeding grounds. \n Use fly-repelling sprays and fly traps around the barn. \n Infected mouth germs will share the EIA disease just like blood. \n This will prevent an infected horse's blood from getting into other horses. \n While this is a good practice anyway, the threat of EIA makes it an even better one. \n While diseases can definitely be fatal, a horse is much less prone to becoming sick if he's happy and well cared for. \n 
 Does your family come before or after your faith in god, if you believe in god? Is it more important for you to spend time on the hobbies that make you personally happy, or to focus on the career that supports your family and gives them a comfortable life? \n By ranking your values and priorities, you’ll be better able to tell whether or not you’re devoting an appropriate amount of energy to each aspect of your life.\n There are no right or wrong answers, but be honest. Maybe traveling brings you the most joy, or maybe it’s a well-cooked meal. Maybe you love talk about books, and you should practice literary criticism. Maybe you like to be the one writing the books, not the one talking about the books other people have written. \n The list might evolve over time. What makes you happy at twenty might not be what makes you happy at thirty. Don’t be married to an image of “who you are” — update your list over time to reflect what makes you happy in the present moment. \n Having “stuff” makes a lot of people happy, but don’t fool yourself into thinking that just having things is the root of joy. You may want a nice sound system because you love music, but focus on your love of music, not the sound system.Be aware that going to concerts, singing with friends, and whistling on your drive to work are all equally important elements that work with the fancy sound system to bring you joy. \n Meditation can be incredibly beneficial for mental health and happiness, and can clear your mind so you can see your priorities more clearlyAlthough it has religious and mystical roots, meditative techniques can be used by anyone for relaxation and stress relief. \n Find a tranquil environment free from distracting sounds and activities — someplace where you can clear your mind and focus on your state of being. \n Sit in a comfortable position like the lotus position with your eyes closed, and focus on your breathing. \n Inhale and exhale slowly, deeply, and purposefully. \n Focus on your breath, how it feels entering and exiting your body. Be present fully in your body in the moment, and do your best to think of nothing else. \n Do this at the same time every day to make it part of your routine. Early in the morning, before you go to work, is a good time for meditation because it calms and prepares you for the rest of your day. \n If you’re a great public speaker, and you really enjoy giving presentations, you’re wasting your talents away coding programs at a desk. Maybe you should be a teacher instead! \n Are you a good speaker? \n Do you work best alone or in teams? \n Do you work best when you’re given tasks, or when you have to lead your own projects? \n Although not everybody can have a career in something they’re absolutely crazy about, most people should be able to match up interests and careers to some degree. \n There are many tests you can take to figure out what kinds of jobs are best matched up with your interests., Some people can’t stand the idea of working every day from 9-5 in an office setting. If you need the flexibility to work at your own pace, during your own work hours, from a setting of your choosing, maybe you need to find freelance or contract work. Other people could not imagine the constantly shifting schedule of a university professor, for example, and crave the stability and ritual of a 9-5 workday and Monday to Friday workweek. \n Ask yourself what kind of schedule would work best with your work habits. \n Don’t choose freelance work if you slack off and lose focus easily! \n Note that freelance and contract work is less stable than regular office work, and usually does not offer benefits. \n Although you shouldn’t ever choose a career just for the money, you also don’t want to labor away without ever making enough money to support yourself and your family. Calculate a budget for how much money you’ll need to maintain your family at a level of comfort that’s acceptable. \n Search online for average salaries in various career paths.Figure out if the career you’re thinking about will work with your budget. \n You need to put everything on the backburner except for your career satisfaction. \n To prepare for a career change, you should begin saving as much money as possible. A career change sometimes means you have to start your new job at a lower-paying position before you can work your way back up the ladder. \n What are your most uncompromising, unchanging beliefs? Some examples might be: \n You want a big family vs. you don’t want kids \n Religious beliefs \n Feelings about marriage and/or divorce \n Prioritize the things you’re looking for in a relationship and figure out what the five most important elements are. Some examples might be: \n Sense of humor \n Good-looking \n Shares your taste in music or other hobbies \n Enjoys/avoids outdoor activities \n Financial stability \n Regardless of how great a romantic partner you find, you’ll never be happy in a relationship until you can be happy with yourself.You’ll also have a better idea of what you want and need in a partner if you’re the best version of yourself that you can possibly be, and you’re happy with it. \n Admit that you’re never going to find someone who meets your entire checklist, and just be open to spending time with the people you feel a connection with. \n Some people know from a young age that they want to be parents, but it’s not so obvious an option for many. There’s nothing wrong with that! Don’t let anyone — parents, friends, society at large — pressure you into a choice you don’t want for yourself. Some things to keep in mind include: \n Are you called to parenthood? Though it’s more commonly ascribed to women (biological clocks, maternal instincts), both men and women sometimes just feel the urge to start a family. Other times, that need simply isn’t there. \n Can you afford a family? As of 2014, the estimated cost of raising a child from birth to legal adulthood is $245,000.How much wiggle room will that give you, based on your family income? Will you be able to give children a good quality of life? Will you have a comfortable retirement? \n Do you understand the realities of parenting? Although most all parents will say that their children are their greatest joy and achievement, they’ll also tell you how hard it is to raise a child. As a parent, it will be your responsibility to safeguard your child against all dangers, to provide them with the best possible life, and to socialize them into a responsible citizen of the world. You’ll have to put up with temper tantrums and expensive Christmas lists, etc., etc. It’s a hard job! \n Remember that women can always have their eggs frozen if they choose not to have children in prime child-bearing age.Although it’s difficult to get pregnant as women’s bodies age, freezing young eggs gives you a better chance at having a child if you choose to start a family later in life. \n If you decide that you do, in fact, want to have children, the next step is to figure out how large you want your family to grow. Again, some of this is just instinct; some people can just feel in their bones that they want a large family. But there are many practical considerations you should keep in mind. \n Again, each child will cost about $245,000 over their 18 years of legal childhood! \n How much attention can you devote to each child? A single child will get as much attention as their parents have to offer, but with each additional child, your attention will grow more and more diffused over your growing brood. How much time will you have to drive each child to their individual after-school activities, help with homework, listen to them talk about their days, etc.? \n How much companionship do you want your child to have? Even if you can’t devote undivided parental attention to a child, having many siblings means your children will always have playmates to keep them occupied and to help each other through the trying emotional times when they don’t always turn to their parents. \n Remember that with your third child, you are officially outnumbered. With two children, one parent can manage each in a given situation, but with three children, there’s a spare child running loose! \n Though traditional gender roles see a man in the workplace and a woman raising the children at home, these days, both men and women should feel equally comfortable in either role. \n Childcare for children whose parents work can be so expensive, depending on where you live, that it may not be worth the income from your job.Would be comfortable with other people spending that much time raising your children, regardless of how much you trust them? \n Do you want to be present for all of your child’s developmental milestones, and would working in an office get in the way of that? \n Would staying at home with your child all day make you feel claustrophobic, or like you’re being defined solely by your identity as a parent? \n Would staying at home keep you from the passions and interests you get to explore every day at a job you love? \n Despite what a legion of parenting books would have you think, there’s no right or wrong way to be a parent. After all, people raised children for centuries without guidebooks. It is important, though, to think about what kind of parent you want to be to be as happy as possible. \n Do you want to be a hands-on parent who walks their children through all of their decisions and activities, or do you want to be a more laissez-faire parent who lets their children make and learn from their own mistakes? \n How involved do you want to be in their education? Will you check homework every night? Assign extra homework outside of class? Or let more qualified teachers handle their education? \n How do you want to reprimand your children when they make mistakes? Would you feel more comfortable in a good cop or bad cop role? Another way to think of it might be “do you want to be more of a coach who helps make good decisions, or a referee who identifies and punishes mistakes?” \n Do you put your children first before all others, or does your marriage take priority? What about your personal happiness? \n 
 \n The Player's Handbook (PHB) is probably the most important one here. The Player's Handbook 2 and 3 (PHB2 and PHB3) extend it and might also be useful. \n A single set of D&D dice, usually priced at $6-$10 USD. \n Regular line paper can be used\n A writing utensil. Pencils are preferred due to the massive amount writing and erasing \n \n The following races are available to play in 4th edition: Deva, Dragonborn, Drow, Dwarf, Eladrin, Elf, Genasi, Githzerai, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Goliath, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Halfling, Hamadryad, Human, Kalashtar, Shifter, Minotaur, Mul, Pixie, Revenant, Satyr, Shadar-Kai, Shade, Shardmind, Thri-Kreen, Tiefling, Vryloka, Warforged, and Wilden. \n The races of Dragonborn, Dwarf, Eladrin, Elf, Half-Elf, Halfling and Human can be found in the PHB. \n The races of Deva, Gnome, Goliath, Half-Orc, and Shifter can be found in the PHB2. \n The races of Githzerai, Minotaur, Shardmind, and Wilden can be found in the PHB3. \n The races of Drow and Genasi can be found in the Forgotten Realms Player's Guide. \n The races of Warforged, Changeling and Kalashtar can be found in the Eberron Player's Guide. \n The races of Mul and Thri-Kreen can be found in the Dark Sun Campaign Setting. \n The races of Gnoll and Shadar-Kai can be found in issues 367 and 372 of Dragon Magazine. \n The races of Shade and Vryloka can be found in the Heroes of Shadow. \n The races of Satyr, Pixie and Hamadryad can be found in Heroes of The Feywild. \n \n The four roles are Controller, Defender, Leader, and Striker. \n Controllers deal damage to multiple enemies and prefer offense over defense. Controller classes include Druids, Invokers, and Wizards. \n Defenders are front-line combatants and have high defense. Defender classes include Fighters, Paladins, and Wardens. \n Leaders have healing and aiding abilities to protect the rest of the party as their roll, and also boast high defense. Leader classes include Bards, Clerics, Shamans, and Warlords. \n Strikers deal massive damage to single enemies at a time and have the highest attack and mobility of the party. Striker classes include Avengers, Barbarians, Rangers, Rogues, Sorcerers, and Warlocks. \n You should consult their descriptions in the source books in making this decision. \n The PHB contains information on the classes Cleric, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warlock, Warlord, and Wizard. \n The PHB2 contains information on the classes Avenger, Barbarian, Bard, Druid, Invoker, Shaman, Sorcerer, and Warden. \n The PHB3 contains information on the classes Ardent, Battlemind, Monk, Psion, Runepriest, and Seeker. \n Also create a vertical column with six lines title stats. At the beginning of each line, write down the following: Strength (Str), Constitution (Con), Dexterity (Dex), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha). These make up the six ability scores of your character. ]] \n Strength represents physical power. \n Constitution represents health and stamina. \n Dexterity represents agility and reflexes. \n Intelligence represents reasoning. \n Wisdom represents common sense. \n Charisma represents personality. \n Ability scores are the base statistics for your character and can be determined with one of three methods. Note that each class depends on certain ability scores, which typically means that you should assign higher scores to these abilities. \n The first method uses a standard array of scores. Assign the following numbers to each ability score any way you like: 16, 14, 13, 12, 11, and 10. \n The second method is a little more complicated. Start with the following scores: 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, and 10. You have 22 "points" to spend in order to increase the ability scores. Use the following rules to spend these points and improve your ability scores, then assign the score to the specific abilities. \n Improving the numbers 8-12 costs one point. As such, increasing the "8" to a "12" would cost 4 points. Improving a "10" to a "13" would cost only 3: one point each for 10-to-11, 11-to-12, and 12-to-13. \n Improving the numbers 13-15 costs two points. As such, increasing the "12" from before would cost another point to become a "13", but an additional two points to improve to a "14". Similarly, improving the "13" to a "16" would cost 6 points: two each for 13-to-14, 14-to-15, and 15-to-16. \n Improving a "16" to a "17" costs another three points. \n Improving a "17" to an "18" costs another four points. As a result, upgrading a "10" to an "18" would cost a total of 16 points = 3*1 + 3*2 + 3 + 4. \n The third method uses randomly-generated numbers and provides the most versatile and volatile scores. For each ability score, roll 4 6-sided dice (4d6). Add the three highest numbers, ignore the lowest, and assign the sum as an ability score. \n \n Add or subtract these from the base stats. Once the base stats have been assigned after racial adjustments, assign each score an ability modifier, with either a plus or minus sign next to the base stat followed by the number. The table shows the ability modifiers: \n Ad infinitum. At first level, 8 should be the lowest ability score and 18 the highest. Average scores are considered between 12-16. \n In the PHB, a list of skills to choose from can be found in chapter five. First, go to your classes' entry in the PHB in chapter four. \n These skills are the skills you are trained in, and each get a permanent +5 bonus. \n They can be found on page 178 of the PHB. \n Next to each skill ability, write down the skill points you currently have. Each skill point is equal to one-half of your level plus your ability score modifier and +5 if you are trained in that skill. \n As an example, say you are playing a 1st-level human rogue with the following ability scores: \n str 11 +0 \n con 10 +0 \n dex 16 +3 \n int 12 +1 \n wis 8 -1 \n cha 14 +2 \n A rogue is automatically trained in Thievery and Stealth, meaning he or she gets an automatic +5 points for both of those skills. They can also choose four of the following skills to be trained in: \n Acrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Dungeoneering, Insight, Intimidate, Perception, and Streetwise. \n As an example, Acrobatics, Bluff, Perception, and Streetwise were chosen to be trained skills. This means that the rogue currently has six skills he or she is trained in and has a permanent +5 bonus to. Since Acrobatics is a dexterity-based skill, the dexterity modifier of the rogue is added to the score, which is +3 in this case. Acrobatics is now equal to 8 total skill points. \n At first level, you may choose one feat from chapter six. If you are human, you gain an additional feat. Feats provide static bonuses to characters, and bonuses of the same type do not stack together. \n If you do, you may choose the feat If you don't, you must wait until you meet the prerequisite. \n Powers are different kinds of attack your character can make and are divided into four categories: At-Will, Encounter, Daily, and Utility powers. "At-Will" powers can be used once per turn in an encounter indefinitely. "Encounter" powers can be used once per combat encounter. "Daily" powers can be used once per day. \n Utility powers act like feats in that they give you static bonuses and certain advantages. \n Each class in both the PHB and PHB2 list their powers in the same chapter. However, additional 4th edition d&d books are available for an extended list of available powers. The Martial Power handbook provides more \n The Arcane Power handbook provides more powers for arcane characters. The Primal Power handbook provides more powers for primal characters. The Martial Power Handbook provides more power to martial characters. \n At first level, each player can choose 2 at-wills, 1 encounter, and 1 daily powers. You can choose 1 utility power at second level. \n At first level, you start with 100 gold pieces(gp) to spend on equipment. Chapter in the PHB provides you with a list of equipment to choose from. Purchase armor and weapons first, and then basic adventuring supplies. It's up to the party who carries what, unless you purchased all of your equipment on your own. Once these things are purchased, if you have any money left over you can choose to spend it on magic items, also found in chapter 7 in the PHB. The Adventurer's Vault Handbook provides an extension of supplies you can choose from as well. \n It is highly recommended you use a character sheet to record your player info, but it is not necessary. Regular paper can work as well. \n \n Lawful Good means you follow the rules and do good. \n Good means you do good, but does not necessarily mean you follow rules. \n Chaotic Evil is ultimate evil. You can do anything you want if it is evil. \n Evil means that you do evil, but you should follow rules. \n Initiative determines who goes in what order in a combat. Your initiative bonus is equal to one-half your level plus your dexterity modifier, and any bonuses or penalties that apply from armor or feats. \n Each of these defenses are equal to 10 plus one-half of your level plus the appropriate ability modifier. For armor class, add your armor bonus if any, and if you wear light armor add either your dex or int modifier, whichever of the two is higher. Fortitude uses the Str or Con modifier, Reflex uses the Dex or Int modifier, and Will uses the Wis or Cha modifier, whichever of the two is higher. If your class or race has any bonuses to these defenses, add them. \n Speed is determined by your character's race. \n Passive perception and passive insight are the two most common passive senses. You have +10 in passive perception and passive insight at first level. \n Attack bonuses are equal to one-half your level plus your attack's ability score modifier plus any class bonuses plus any proficiencies with a weapon plus any feats plus any weapon enhancements. An attack bonus, also known as a to-hit bonus, is added onto a d20 roll whenever you make a specific attack. \n Your hit points are determined by your class. Your bloodied value is equal to half of your hit points. Your healing surges per day are determined by your class. Your healing surge value is equal to one-fourth of your total hit points. \n
 This all seems a little too logical, but you need to get these down in permanent ink in order to know what's the best size of venue, the right budget, the nature of presentations, amount (or type) of guests, and what strategies to employ for your specific event. So what's your ideal outcome? What do you want to get done? \n Once you figure out what you're doing (celebrating, fundraising, educating, selling, proposing, etc.), think about why you're doing it. Knowing your motivations can help give you focus and drive. \n Having a few objectives can also help align you in the direction you need to be going. You can't keep trying to reach a goal that hasn't been set! When you have $4,000 and you're aiming for $5,000, that goal can push you through to the finish line.\n This is one of the most important factors in your event planning. Pick a date and time no one can make and it doesn't even matter how great an event you have planned. And pick a date and time that's too far into the future -- or coming up too soon -- and your guests will either forget about it or already have plans. The Goldilocks syndrome of event managing! \n Ideally, you want to let your guests know about two weeks out. That gives them a good amount of time to not yet have plans and a good timeline for inviting them and reminding them once or twice before the time actually comes. So have your event be a few weeks into the future minimum, if you can swing it. \n Now that you have an idea of what you're doing and when you're doing it, you can start thinking about venues and approaching potential ones with a date and things you'll need. What kind of building do you want to host in and how will the space be managed? Are the guests to be sitting on chairs in rows, on benches or at tables, or on picnic rugs in the open? Will the weather pose a problem? Will there need to be room for dancing, speakers podium or a stage? If so, plan to ensure the event space is large enough. \n It is always best to visit the site in advance and draw yourself a map of the area. This map can be used as a "battle plan" and allows you to sketch and allocate table space, service routes for food service, disabled access if required and exit routes, as well as how you will get the equipment into place. You should also mark where the power generator (if required), external equipment such a refrigerator, ice maker, barbecue or stoves (etc.) will be, as well as where power points and cables will be (which may be covered discreetly with a rug) and other safety hazards to address. \n Are legal and local government approvals required? In most instances approvals are required for a bar, but also for excessive noise, vehicle access and parking, building large enclosures such as a pavilion and other needs. \n How many people can your budget and venue handle? Some events are strictly ticket entry or invitation only, so it is easier to plan, but many events will have latecomers, or extras such as children, partners or friends. And keep in mind that the more guests you have, the more crew you need, too. \n As it can be the biggest logistical problem it's always wise to ensure there adequate room for all people to move around at the site. \n In older establishments, they usually call the quantity of guests "pax," so if working in a function centre and you see "Pax 150" it means 150 guests are expected. \n Hopefully you have a few people you can lean on to gauge together how much money you'll need for this event. Are you paying any staff? Renting equipment and your venue? Supplying food and drinks? Publishing pamphlets or postcards? Settle on a number that seems doable and cater your plan to it. You don't want to wind up paying out of your own pockets for this if you don't have to. \n You may be in a situation where you can get sponsorships or donations, but most of us aren't so lucky. If you don't foresee any more funds coming in, it's imperative that you cut corners when need be. Instead of having a catering team, form a BYO or a "bring-a-plate" function (catering is minimal, but you will need to provide a food table, bain maries and refrigerators). Instead of hiring a photographer, go around and take photos yourself. Get creative where need be! \n Organize your service team (even if they are friends and relatives or other volunteers) to handle different, relevant sections, even if you're not professionally running an event, but running a small family event. Good event management in a big scale is about organizing people to be in charge of individual areas of the event and making sure everyone knows what the plan is. \n Your crew needs just as much advanced noticed as the teams you're hiring and your guests. Assign them duties as soon as possible, giving them preference if you can. And try to have a few people on standby -- there are always a few flakes in every bunch. \n No more planning can happen until know just what's going to happen at your event. When are the speakers speaking? Are there games, activities, or presentations that should be scheduled? How much time will the guests need to eat? Work out a fairly detailed timeline for the day's activities. \n Always leave a little wiggle room; no event will be exactly as you planned, down to the minute. People run late, speeches take longer than expected, the line for the buffet doesn't shuffle along, you name it. So while you need a good idea of what's happening, understand that it's for organizational purposes and nothing is written in stone. \n Because how else will people know to come?! You gotta send them invites! And this isn't something you should scrimp on, either. Your invitation is the face of your event. The first impression people get of what to expect and if they should even come. It's gotta be good. \n Consider your typical invitations -- postcards, flyers, etc. But also go paperless: email, newsletters, Facebook, Twitter, and sites like Eventbrite that serve as invitations, guest trackers, and a calendar. \n Correction: if you're trying to get as many people to come as possible, definitely use Facebook and Twitter. If you're trying to keep it to VIPs only, avoid these platforms. That's just asking for trouble. \n You'll need a headcount to know just how much and what you all need, so keep track! It probably won't be the number that actually show up, but it should give you a general idea. Websites designed for event managing can help you do this -- but so can Facebook and an Excel spreadsheet. \n Will you need to find, hire, book or delegate photographers, builders, designers and decorators, guest speakers, sponsors, entertainers or bands, officiates or clergy, dancing partners or demonstrations? It is wise to include them in catering and seating calculations so that a meal and a table place is provided for them if appropriate or required, too. \n Are food and beverages provided? If so, know who will be on the team to look after the cooking, serving and cleaning. What type of food do you need to serve? Are there likely to be guests with allergies, vegetarian or vegan needs, diabetics, religious needs such as halal or kosher, gluten-free, (etc)? And will there be infants, young children or the aged or injured who cannot eat solid foods? \n Are entertainment and logistics organised? This part might be delivery of music equipment, pavilions or tents and decorative effects or stage management you will need, such as a microphone and amplifiers, lighting, power outlets, projectors and screens for slideshows, smoke machines or other stage magic effects such as mirrors, banners and corporate signage, etc. \n If you subcontract a company to be entertainers, consult with them to ensure they are able to supply and set-up their own equipment as well as where the stage and service sections will be on the site and what the schedule will be. This way you can find out what you may need to do to assist them. \n Caterers, florists, entertainers and other important people appreciate as much time as possible to plan, as it is typically more expensive to obtain goods and staff for high urgency requests. The other advantage is should they not be able to keep your appointment, you have some time still to find an alternative. \n The MC doesn't always organise the event entirely, but they do host the event. It is usually a member of the party, who will organise speeches, announce events such as the meal courses, dancing, notable guests or entertainment. Liaise with this person often and keep them up-to-date. If they're any good, they'll be very helpful. \n Sometimes you may have to be the MC, in which case the job becomes much harder as you will need to keep working until it's all over. It then becomes important to set up your service team with their own group leaders so you can delegate most of the normal duties to them. \n When you hire a team, check and double-check that they're bringing the gear they need. In some cases, they may just be providing you bodies or goods and leaving it at that; you may need to source the equipment separately. It can be rented, bought, or even borrowed from your extensive social network. Go through your checklist from napkins to PA systems to extension cords. \n Decorations are a huge part of any event. Table linens, flowers, gifts, candles, balloons, banners or backdrops for photography, red carpets, (etc) should always be sourced well in advance. \n One thing many rookies forget are the finer points of the facilities. Are there enough? Examples are toilets and bathrooms, car parking spaces, wheelchair access ramps, changing rooms, storage rooms and kitchen space, waste disposal bins, wine coolers, power access, etc. These are obstacles that are only workable if you foresee them well in advance. \n Also think outside of your event: will transport and accommodation be required for international or out-of-town guests or delegates at hotels, as well as bookings and space made for their transport to get them to and from the event? \n Understanding the social hierarchy of your event -- if it's not truly yours -- is integral to knowing how to handle any situation. As it is essential that the client has confidence in you, you will need to find out: \n Who the key guests are––this is usually straightforward when it is a celebration event––such as the bride and groom. The client is not always the key guest/s but may be part of their group, or not present at all. \n Who the host guests are––these people often act as hosts at their own tables and tend to be good socializes and motivators of guests. These people are useful to keep a convivial atmosphere and strike up a conversation if things turn quiet, encourage people to dance or to introduce people to other guests to make new friendships. These people should be reliable but are generally useful to know as they will keep you informed, may step in and be a guest speaker or MC for you in an emergency and these are the people overall who make the event flow the smoothest at the front line. \n Who the peacemakers are. You should be aware at all times who these key people are as you need to advise them of issues and involve them in the handling of issues and disputes where appropriate. This will generally be the head of the family, a caretaker, or head honchos or hired security. \n Who the decision maker is. For most cases it is yourself as manager, but when you must consult guests and it is not appropriate to involve the key guests (as they typically will be occupied being good hosts), find out who you should consult in an emergency. Ultimately it would be the person who pays the bill if you're charging for your services, or whomever you may deem as "the client" as the person having the final say on the matter. \n Well before the event, it's a good idea to scope out your venue and figure out how everything will be set up. You may need to make additional arrangements to accommodate the floor plan -- extension cords, lighting, etc. And if it's hard to find for you, it'll probably be hard to find for your guests, so be sure to take that into account, too! \n If it's up to you, map out where everything will go and when. If there isn't room for it, it needs to go. Talk to the venue's manager about what help they're willing and able to pitch in and if there are any city codes you need to abide by, especially in the case of emergency. \n Your crews are going to be working hard. In order to show them your appreciation and to keep them on top of their game, make them a kit to give at the top of the event. Bottles of water, granola bars, chocolates, little tokens of appreciation, whatever you see fit. It'll up morale from the get-go, too. \n Consider getting them badges or a little party favor to make them feel part of the event and to remember it by. And make sure they stay fed and watered! Always think of your team as resources you want to be able to use in the future. \n Before the event, it's important to have all your ducks in a row. Be sure to provide clear instructions to your crew on how to get to the site and give them your number or preferably a business card with contacts to call if they need directions. Does anybody have any questions? No? And break! \n Make sure everyone is comfortable with their duties. Some people may not be willing to vocalize this, so read them if at all possible. Do they seem sure and confident? If not, reassure them, go over their duties, and ask them a few basic questions. When in doubt, pair them with a more able partner. \n Your own personal organization is just as important as the event's organization. If you're organized and things go haywire, all can still be fine. But if you're not, hell can break loose. Here's a few ways to prepare yourself: \n Make a contact sheet with phone numbers and addresses. The baker thought you were picking up the cake? No problem. Call Ashley who lives nearby -- she can swing by the bakery on her way to the event. \n Make a checklist. As teams file in, you'll know what goods, what equipment, and what bodies are missing. \n Prepare invoices and billing as necessary. The more on top of your game you are now, the fewer problems you'll have later. \n Is it likely there will be frequent artistic changes? Weddings are infamous for clients making last minute design changes so it is wise to recommend to your clients a cut-off date for changes. Usually 1 week before the event is leaving it very close, but it gives the client some flexibility and avoids last minute changes coming too late to be practical or cost effective to implement. \n If it is simple, subtle or basic changes using already sourced decorations, then it is not unreasonable to accede to change requests. Be as accommodating as possible in what is usually a very emotionally anticipated event. \n Be the first to arrive at the site to oversee the preparations. Make sure everyone files in accordingly and start making phone calls if not. Assist those who need assisting, direct those who need directed, and get out of the way when you need to. No injuries until after the event, please. \n You'll feel a little calmer if you make a checklist. Have a portion for your crew, a portion for hired out crews, a portion for decorations and basic set-up, and a portion for equipment. When all is checked off, that's when you have time to breathe. \n Do not be afraid to delegate. The main stressor when it comes to an event is time. To save it, all hands need to be on deck -- or different decks. If someone isn't being as useful as they could be, give them something better to do. It's your job. It's not you being bossy or overstepping your boundaries; it's you doing what you're supposed to do. \n When you delegate, be firm but polite. Say, "Juan, I need you over here right now to help out with the caterers. Thank you." Your crew needs to jive together as much as the event does. Keep everything moving swimmingly by being the leader that you need to be. \n This means making sure that things are kept to schedule and assisting or having backup plans if it falls behind -- and being okay with it. If you start stressing out, you'll lose your head. Nothing good will come of that. So when that speech runs ten minutes over and the speaker is ignoring your blatant distress signals or your attempt at feigning a stroke to create a diversion, relax. You'll just adjust the appetizer and no one will notice. Event intact. \n Things happen. They do. They have a bad habit of happening. There's no way you can predict everything, and the sooner you accept this the better. A calm, collected event manager can do wonders for any event; a strung-out, tense one cannot. So relax and go with the flow -- it'll all be over soon! \n Check that guest numbers and needs are still correct on the day of the event and advise the service team of any changes at the earliest possible opportunity You should be the first set of eyes that notices if anything goes wrong. \n Consult with your clients to see how they are feeling; they may be excited, nervous, worried, bored or mentally drained or have some issue on their plate that in some cases you may soothe with understanding, some kind words and practical assistance. It is wise to use this time to rejuvenate the enthusiasm in guests and the team where appropriate. \n Trust and respect your service team to look after themselves -- if you've given them a good base, they should be fine. Offer assistance if needed, but they should be experienced enough not to need any help at all. Here are a few things to keep in mind: \n Act as a concierge or receptionist at the beginning, meeting and greeting each guest (if appropriate) as they come. Hand over the reins to the MC when the event starts. The management role will be more active problem solving and ensuring all the back of housework such as food preparation and service runs to plan. \n Keep an eye on the guests and keep contact with the MC often and discreetly in case they want (or need) to change plans. \n Keep a respectful distance from the key guests - after all, the event is all about them - but be easily accessible by checking at appropriate moments how they feel the event is going, as well as any problems, requests or suggestions they may have. \n You want all your guests to remember how awesome of a time they had. Actually, you probably want more than that. A visit to a website, future donations, word of mouth buzz, whatever. To ensure that your event is the legend it deserves to be, give a takeaway. Whether it's a picture, a flyer, or a pen, having something to remind your guests of the event is a good way to make sure you stay in their minds. \n Most events tend to run themselves when they start, but all the hard work is the preparation that no-one sees. So pat yourself on the back because you deserve it! Okay, back to tearing it down. The job's not over yet! \n After the event, arrange a time to meet and thank your client. It is always recommended to offer an appropriate and thoughtful gift to remember their time with you, as it is these small touches that make the experience richer and may make them recommend your services in future. If you gave a gift during the event, such as in a gift registry with the other guests, then a thoughtful after present such as flowers, a framed photograph of your favourite moment at their event (such as cutting the ribbon, or the climax of the show, or the award ceremony, or the wedding kiss, or blowing out the candles on a cake, etc), or some other gift may be appropriate. \n Just like mom said, "Leave it in the same condition you found it in," the same goes for your venue. Everything needs to be just like it was before you got there -- this is one business where you don't want to burn any bridges. So let your crews know it's time to tear down and don't let them leave until all is taken care of. And you need to pitch in too! \n This is nice, sure, but it also prevents you from being billed any more than you should be. Many places will tack on extra cleaning fees if they find any opportunity to do so. So make it as spic and span as possible to avoid the hidden costs. \n You may need to arrange returning hired or borrowed equipment and later on consulting with the client about their experience. Even if unpaid after the event, thank them for the opportunity to have such a great experience to run an event with them. Can you get a business card of theirs? \n Thank your crew, too! Make sure all parties are paid (and all parties have paid up), file receipts, and get everyone taken care of. You should be one of the last ones out the door -- and make sure it's locked behind you. \n This one is a common issue, so it is best to be prepared. By and large, delays are understandably hard to avoid (such as unforeseen traffic issues) and are forgiven by guests who came on time. That being said, here are a few things you can do to do your best to keep it from happening: \n Ensure that invitations are clear as to the time of the event and if requesting an RSVP, ensure that the time is confirmed. Communicate with (via your contact sheet) the MC, relevant guests (often the leaders of the party members), entertainers and kitchen staff as soon as you're aware of an issue you cannot resolve easily. Should the delayed guests be the focus (such as the bride and groom), the usual methods are: \n Contact the delayed guest/s directly to check for an estimation. Advise the kitchen immediately of all developments so they can slow down or speed up to keep time. \n Refrain from making it known publicly that the event is being delayed because of certain guests (because the party will work that out on their own), but advise key hosts or members of the party that you have been made aware of the fact. Let them know what you intend to do, but allow the hosts to make a suggestion as they know the members of their party and what would be appropriate in the context. \n Maintain careful watch on the time in relation to speeches. If key guests are late, serve an additional appetizer (first course) and/or beverage early as this will prevent guests who came on time from becoming bored and will keep them occupied. \n For guests that are going to be delayed for more than is reasonable or possible (such as when serving food that simply cannot wait, such as souffles), start the event as planned and when the delayed guests arrive, start them at the next course of a meal (even if this is dessert). \n Organise an additional dance, game, speech or other form of entertainment (especially music), and ensure extra distractions, such as group or party photographs are done until they arrive and this back-up strategy should be considered the day in advance. \n For guests deliberately arriving late, it should be seen as that guest's choice, not your fault as manager, so your duty is first to the guests that are already present and to ensure they're looked after. In a nutshell, act as if there is no problem and carry on regardless. \n This one is rare if you have planned things carefully, however accidents do happen (such as a guest or young child making a mess of a food table, or an accident in the kitchen). Early on you should be aware of the type of guests so you can take into account when and where food is displayed (such as for a buffet) and where such guests are seated. \n Any spillage for safety reasons must be cleaned up immediately, even if it means removing a red carpet or desired décor and furniture to be able to do so. If it is impossible to hide a stain without affecting the appearance or the integrity of the item (such as an antique), then removal is wise. If you have a spare, then use that; if not, move the existing furniture or décor subtly so it does not feel missing. \n A soft rope barrier, curtain or screen is recommended whenever you need to hide the food area (such as a buffet with chafing dishes, or when organising a "reveal" of the next course), as certain guests may feel that if food is in the dining area, it is free-for-all, when they want -- which is not always the case. \n Shuffle the menu. If part of a dish is not possible to include (such as a side dish that was burnt), either exclude it altogether, find an alternative, reduce the portion sizes to stretch foods, but increase portions of other foods to balance. Advise table hosts as required. \n Unexpected vegetarians, teetotallers, those with food allergies, religious or special diets –– no surprise should ever occur with proper planning –– but guests occasionally do bring along additional family members, partners or close friends without advising you, especially if it's not a strict invitation-only event. This is usually easily resolved. Keep a headcount as guests arrive and when they arrive at the door, ask if there are any food requirements and advise the kitchen and service staff immediately. \n For large unexpected groups that are not gatecrashers, send a team member to the kitchen to take stock and, if necessary, drive out to collect more supplies. Kitchens typically over-cater to cover for accidents and more often there are more cancellations than unexpected guests. Limited portions can be stretched when you provide additional fillers, such as bread rolls, salad or vegetable portions, ingredients for which can be quickly sourced from local supermarkets. \n It's wise to remember that many managers have made serious errors in underestimating the intelligence or forgetting the needs and desires of children at events, as they have the same needs and wants as adults - to have a good time and not be bored. Remember that their parents are also often offended if the event does not cater for their children. In practice, it is best to request an RSVP for every child that may come. \n Young children (under 10) are best given food or snacks early as many dinner events have the meals start as late as 8pm, which is far later than most children are used to. Food provided should be fun and healthy but as special as the adult menu as parents appreciate special touches for their children - it makes their job easier so they can have fun as guests in their own right. \n Over 10's usually are fine to be served adult food and portions, even if they don't eat all of it, but offer the children's menu to them (with their parent's permission) if they don't seem keen on the options. It has also been known for young adults 13-18 to often request the same food as youngsters, such as a hamburger and fries as opposed to more formal restaurant food and it has been a frequently used trick to re-brand the children's menu as an "Alternative Menu" for this age group of guests. It is very wise to play safe and discuss with key guests about your plans to keep the young and old engaged, well in advance of the date. \n A discrete area should be provided for mothers with young children for their needs such as toilet/bathroom breaks, breastfeeding (etc.), and a place for very young children to sleep in if they are tired. \n Ideally this would never happen, but it does –– family or corporate events both. Politics and drama often come out at events that, as an outsider, you would not be always aware of. Prepare yourself. \n Ask the client or key guests before the event of the likelihood of such issues, or with selected hosting guests if it is not appropriate to discuss these issues with the key guests, so that way you can ensure that people are seated in places that will not cause issue. Enlist service staff or key-guests to act as unofficial monitors, to keep an eye out for issues and to step in when required. Strictly speaking, your duty is to ensure the event is smoothly run, but only where it is appropriate, and to stay out of issues that are a private concern. Therefore, you should be aware of who within the party are the "peacemakers" of the group. \n As it can be a difficult job to refuse alcohol to an inebriated guest, or to deal with an inebriated guest that inclines towards anger or violence, it is wise to enlist a peacemaker guest and only involve law enforcement when necessary after consulting with the key guests. Even in small events or backyard events when alcohol is often stored in an ice box for guests to serve themselves, it is equally important to be aware. \n Gatecrashers are difficult. Should it happen, unobtrusively evict them if appropriate - consult your key guests to verify that they're unwelcome. For large scale and rowdy or abusive gatecrashers, your duty is to protect the existing guests where appropriate and to call security or the police if they do not leave after being politely asked to do so by yourself and/or the key guests. \n Guests often shuffle name cards about at the beginning where they are sitting, so that they end up sitting next to people they want, or at a table they want. It is wise to check with the key guests how far this is permissible according to them. Typically you should have organised table plans in advance and have received approval from the key guests. Should it be that people must be at certain tables, then it is wise to keep people out of the dining room altogether until time. Often the lobby, foyer or bar area serves this purpose and if it is very important due to family issues, it is wise to group people together and move them en masse to the separate tables by each host-guest and service personnel to seat them in their proper order. \n Sudden, unexpected rain or snow can be common in parts of the world; likewise, a heatwave or a cold front can also can pose a problem. While weather events are not usually an issue if you're indoors, being outside makes things difficult. If bad weather is expected, then consider moving the event location. If the event cannot be relocated or rescheduled, hire a large tent or pavilion (admittedly this can be pricey on short notice). Keeping an eye on weather developments as you go is important; very little can be done to salvage an event affected by weather, so make the best of what you have. \n Many parts of the world now have insurance policies in the event of severe weather or other problems. If you are in an area which is known for unexpectedly changeable weather, it is recommended to source a quote if there may be a chance the event will have to be re-scheduled as it will at least cover the client the cost of extending hire of equipment, site and service personnel. \n 
 One of the most common, important uses of hyphens is to string together related words and concepts to form single words and unified phrases. For example, terms like "state-of-the-art", "first-timer", and "penny-pincher" all use hyphens to create a single idea from multiple words. \n Here are a few examples of hyphens being used correctly in compound words: \n The singer was infamous for his over-reliance on autotune. \n That ten-year-old is remarkably mature for her age. \n As a general rule, you should never put spaces around a hyphen (e.g., write "ten-year-old", not "ten - year - old."\n Most words with prefixes, like "predetermined" and "evermore" don't need hyphens. However, some prefixes (namely, "ex-", "self-", "all-", and sometimes "cross-") need hyphens to separate them from the word they're modifying. Note that "cross" doesn't need to be hyphenated in words like "crossword," where it is part of the word itself, nor in terms like "cross purposes," where it is a separate word, as it's not being used as a prefix in these cases. \n Here is an example of a hyphen being used for prefixes: \n She frequently accused her ex-boyfriend of being completely self-absorbed. \n Similar to the way they are used for compound words, hyphens can also be used to create descriptive, colorful terms that may not be found in the dictionary. Hyphens used in this way allow you to create your own words from scratch. However, it's important to remember not to rely too heavily on unique hyphenated words, as this can become distracting. If you can convey your ideas just as well with one or more normal words, do so. \n Here is an example of a unique hyphenated word used well: \n Kim took time off from her job and became a professional couch-sitter in the days just before giving birth. \n Here is an example of a unique hyphenated word being used in a way that's not necessary. In this case, the hyphens don't make the term any easier to understand. \n I couldn't decide what to get at the pizza place, so I ordered my usual three-cheese-no-meat combo. \n Some words are hyphenated when neglecting the hyphen would make the meaning of the word unclear. For instance, to convey the idea of a duplicate or replica, a writer may use the word "re-creation" in place of "recreation" because the latter can also mean "fun" or "entertainment". Hyphens can also be used in a similar way to make compound words more visually appealing in cases where the first word ends with the same letter that the second starts with. \n Here are a few examples of hyphens used for clarity. In the first, "re-signed" has a different meaning than "resigned" and "foreign-film theater" has a less ambiguous meaning than "foreign film theater". In the second, the hyphen separates the first "e" from the second. \n Jeremy re-signed his contract, then took the train to the foreign-film theater to celebrate. \n After the convicts passed a compulsory period of good behavior, the re-education program began in earnest. \n Though the rules for when to use numerals and when to spell out numbers can vary from style guide to style guide, many grammatical sources will recommend using a hyphen for two-word numbers below one hundred. In other words, use hyphens for the numbers twenty-one through ninety-nine, with the exceptions of thirty, forty, fifty, etc. This also means that after one hundred, you'll still use hyphens between the numbers in the "tens" and "ones" places (e.g. "two hundred twenty-two"). \n Here is an example of correct number hyphenation: \n The wedding reception had eighty-eight guests, but the cooks only prepared seventy-nine entrees. \n When writing fractions out as words, rather than writing them as numerals, you should separate the two numbers in the fraction with a hyphen. This rule is true even for mixed fractions (fractions preceded by a whole number, like "three and five-sixths"). \n Here is an example of hyphens used correctly in two fractions: \n The snickerdoodle recipe calls for two and two-thirds cups of flour and two and one-quarter cups of sugar. \n When someone has two last names (usually because his or her parents kept their own last names after marriage), the names are hyphenated. In rare cases where someone has three or more last names, all of the names are hyphenated. \n Here is an example of hyphens used correctly for last names: \n When Suzie Sanders-Johnson and Tim Rodriguez-Lyle had their first child, they weren't sure what his last name would be. \n In cases where a sentence calls for a list of hyphenated words or numbers that share a common word, it's usually OK to write the word only for the last item in the list. For the other items in the list, write the word or number followed by a hyphen. Separate each item with a comma as you normally would in a list. \n Here is an example of hyphens used in a list: \n For this construction project, we're going to need plenty of ten-, twenty-, and fifty-inch boards. \n If you're ever unsure of when (or when not) to use a hyphen, consult a reference source for guidance. A wide variety of grammar references are available both in print, in libraries or book stores, and online. Be sure to choose a reference source that's well-qualified and professional. It's hard to go wrong with the "big three" style guides: APA Style, MLA Style, and Chicago/Turabian Style. \n Note that minor differences may exist between the style guides you consult. For instance, the MLA style guide allows you to use hyphens for expressing number ranges (e.g., 350-400 degrees), while the Chicago style guide recommends an en dash., Some words which are technically compound words have become so commonplace and well-known that hyphenating them can actually make their meaning less clear. For example, "lunchtime" and "roommate" don't need to be hyphenated, as these common words' meanings are perfectly clear without hyphens. Note that in some cases, hyphens are optional: both "high school" and "high-school" are generally considered acceptable. \n Here is an example of compound words that don't need hyphens: \n I will read you a story at bedtime, but only if you correct the misprints in your book report . \n As noted above, except in some exceptional cases, most words with prefixes don't need hyphens and will look cumbersome if an unnecessary hyphen is added. There are too many of these "normal" prefixes that don't require a hyphen to list, but here are just a few: "pre-", "post-", "non-", "un-", "anti-", "re-", "bi-", "di-", and "de-".Here is an example of words with prefixes that don't need hyphens: \n The recycled paper was strangely unaffected by the heat of the fire. \n When a compound word or phrase can be used as both a verb and a noun or adjective, you generally shouldn't include a hyphen if the word is used as a verb. For instance, the term "back up" can be used as a verb and a noun to mean both "to make a copy of something for safekeeping" and "a copy of something", respectively. Thus, you would write "back up" as a verb like this: "Please back up your hard disk data," and write it as a noun like this: "He is our back-up plan if the other candidate doesn't want the job." \n Here is an example of a verb that doesn't need a hyphen: \n Tell the repairman to fix it. \n However, the same phrase can use a hyphen when it becomes an adjective: \n Call our usual fix-it guy, please. \n Some words, like "today" and "tonight", were once hyphenated like normal compound words. This is generally not done in modern writing, so you shouldn't feel any need to include these superfluous hyphens unless you're specifically trying to mimic an old-fashioned tone or style. \n Here is an example of words that once used hyphens but do not today: \n I shall meet you tomorrow at sunup when the cock crows and not one moment sooner. \n Though hyphens are used to construct many compound words and phrases, you shouldn't use them after adverbs that end with "-ly", like "softly", "strongly", and "deftly", and after the word "very" when it's used as an adverb. Note, however, that you can use hyphens after words that end with "-ly" if they aren't adverbs, like "family", "barely", and so on. As a reminder, adverbs are words that modify or qualify a verb, adjective, or another adverb.Here is an example of adverbs that don't need a hyphen: \n The quickly drying paint was bone dry within the hour. \n Note that hyphens can be used correctly after a word ending in "-ly" that is not an adverb: \n The little boy reached toward the friendly-looking rabbit without fear. \n When you use a compound adjective to compare two or more things or ideas, you shouldn't use a hyphen. This rule stems from the fact that the meaning of these types of adjectives is clear without the aid of a hyphen. For instance, you would never say that one house is "better-constructed than the other", but saying that a house is "better constructed than the other" is just fine. \n Here are a few examples of comparative and superlative adjectives that don't need hyphens: \n After the boxing match, one fighter was clearly more bruised than the other. \n Even the best laid plans sometimes go awry. \n Though it's usually somewhat rare that a person with a non-technical background might have to write at length about chemistry-related topics, it's still useful to note that the names of specific chemicals don't contain hyphens. This is true even for chemicals with long names containing multiple prefixes, like monochloroacetic acid. \n Here is an example of chemical names where hyphens are not needed: \n After adding the cyclopentane to the Erlenmeyer flask, the scientist stirred in 5 milliliters of hydrochloric acid. \n Two symbols called the en dash and the em dash resemble the hyphen but are used for different purposes. En dashes ("–") are slightly longer than a hyphen, while em dashes ("—") are even longer. In informal writing, you can usually get away with using hyphens and dashes interchangeably, but in formal contexts, you'll want to keep the uses of each distinct, as it can be considered a grammar error to do so. Following these general rules can help you keep your use of hyphens and dashes distinct. Below are a few of the situations in which you'll need to use dashes: \n Ranges of dates, numbers, times, and values (en dashes) \n Prefixes for words which don't usually have them (en dashes) \n Substituting for blank or missing content (em dashes) \n Abrupt sentence interruptions (em dashes) \n Punctuating a sentence with extra information (em dashes) \n En dashes are often used to express the idea that two or more words or numbers are connected by a range of values in between. For instance, in the sentence "We just delivered the Jan–Apr issue," the dash implies that the magazine is for January through April, not just January and April. Note that when using en dashes for ranges, you shouldn't put a space on either side of the dash. \n Here is an example of an en dash used to express a range: \n Would you please schedule me an appointment for 1:00–2:00 PM? \n In general cases, you shouldn't use any sort of punctuation mark for common prefixes like "pre-", "post-", "re-", and so on. However, when connecting this sort of prefix to a word like a proper noun, a complex phrase, or a word that would look awkward or cumbersome without some sort of separating mark, it's acceptable to use an en dash. Obviously, however, en dashes shouldn't be used for words like "preselect" or "postgame" where the meaning is already clear. \n Here are a few examples of en dashes used to attach prefixes: \n The professor's degree in the pre–Cold War history of Russia qualified him to teach his course on Czar Nicholas II. \n Post–Andy Kaufman, the comedy landscape just didn't seem as vivid. \n Em dashes can be used to abruptly break the flow of a sentence to convey related information, add commentary, and more. Em dashes used in this way can either come before the words inserted into the middle of the sentence or before and after them if the original sentence continues after the interruption. Unlike typical hyphen and dash usage, some grammatical resources allow you to separate em dashes from the rest of the sentence with spaces when used this way.Below are a few examples of em dashes used to interrupt sentences: \n Deborah — who was nineteen — still loved the swings at the local park. \n There's no need to lock the door — I'm coming out after you. \n Em dashes can also be used at the end of a sentence to show that the flow of words has abruptly ceased before the sentence would normally have ended. In this case, you shouldn't end the sentence with a period, question mark, or exclamation point as you normally would. This is an especially useful tool for written dialog, as it allows you to show when one character interrupts another by speaking over him. \n Here's an example of an em dash being used to show someone's speech being interrupted: \n Where are we going? The police are right --—" "Shh! They'll hear you." \n In some cases, when information is intentionally left out, it's acceptable to use one or more em dashes to substitute for the missing words or letters. Often, this is used in citations: some style guides call for three em dashes to be used in place of an author's name when it needs to be listed many times in a row.This can also be used to "censor" the names of people or places to keep them confidential. \n Here is an example of an em dash being used to substitute for missing information: \n The paranormal incident took place in the night sky just outside of the rural town of N——. \n

 Try to make a strawberry-banana Smoothie if you have the ingredients. All you need is 1 half of a Banana (chopped in to fourths), 4 medium sized strawberries (frozen or fresh), a cup of soy milk and 3-4 ice cubes. Add soy milk first then add the bananas, strawberries, and ice cubes then blend for about 20 seconds and enjoy. Or you can go to: https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Banana-Smoothie\n Curl up on your bed with a blanket and a magazine/book. \n You can either just sit in the silence or you can do some stretches, yoga, tai chi, or Qui Gong. If you do decide to do one of these, research them and find some of the moves. \n You can also light some candles and put them at the foot of your bathtub. Relax for about 30 minutes and think of good thoughts, maybe a favorite past time or a favorite scene in a movie. \n Dry yourself by patting your body with a towel, your skin will feel softer if you do this. Wrap the towel around your body and stay in the bathroom. \n The steam from the bath softened the skin and loosened the hairs so that its less painful. \n Do not put on uncomfortable clothing such as jeans, tight shirts, skirts or work clothes, these won't help you relax at all. \n Mix a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of milk in the bowl then heat it in your microwave for 10 seconds. Mix again and apply to your face and neck for 15 minutes then rinse off with warm water. Splash your face with cold water about 3 times to close the pores. Pat your face dry with a towel. \n First fill a small bowl or bottom of a water bottle with warm water, you can add either add olive oil or lemon juice. Olive oil moisturizes while lemon juice whitens the nails. Soak nails for about 5 minutes then pat them dry. Clip nails to a mid-length (not long nor short) then use a toothpick to clean under them. Shape nails to an oval by going from the edge of the nail to the tip in a semi-circular motion. You can also paint your nails, but if you just took off nail polish its best to wait a day or two to let your nails breathe. \n The possibilities for a foot soak are endless. A favorite would be a half cup of epsom salts, 1/4 cup of sea salt, and 8 drops of Lavender oil. Lavender is soothing and it helps get rid of scars and heal blisters. Fill the bowl with warm-hot water and keep your feet in it for 15 minutes. Remove and dry. \n Scrub your feet while they are still wet if you use the pumice stone, but if you use a foot file make sure your feet are dry. Clip your toenails until they are short and square with round edges, make sure you also file the nails this way. Apply large amounts of lotion and sit back and relax for about 15-20 minutes then tissue the excess off. \n If you are using your computer and you don't wish to wait for a while til youtube loads, use www.imeem.com It is a safe playlist website and you can search all your favorite music, from classical to rap.

Just make sure its not dark out, if it is then just stay in. \n 
 You might just want to erase it when you're done. \n Doodle those emotions you've been bottling up for the past few days. Just don't doodle on class books, as your teachers may tell you off for it. \n \n \n If you're lucky, it might somehow become a bestseller. Or you could dream about this being a possibility. \n For example, write lyrics about your dull day in school suddenly turning out exciting. Include lots of crazy happenings, such as a dragon entering the front yard and trying to blow down the school. \n Write a rap about your boring lesson. \n Write an episode of a dramatic medical or police drama and turn it into a joke. \n The teacher may make you throw it out if you do it, so don't get caught! \n There are many things you could draw in class. Here are some suggestions: \n Draw your annoying little brother being savaged by a crocodile. Or, maybe draw the end of the world. \n Create a really cool cartoon. It can just be a picture or like a comic strip. Draw whatever takes your fancy. \n Draw a self portrait. \n Draw and design a new ice cream or cupcake. \n Draw number people. \n \n Create a really cheesy joke that will keep you entertained. \n Think of funny things. \n (Dandelion juice anyone?), Imagine yourself starring in a TV show or movie, meeting your favorite celebrity, heroically saving someone, or whatever tickles your fancy. Be a Walter Mitty (look it up if you don't know who that is yet). \n Since you have to stare at the teacher, try transforming the teacher into something else: \n Imagine your teacher in different costumes. What would they look like as a bunny? A witch? The President of the USA? \n Imagine your teacher doing the Gangnam Style dance. It will be sure to crack you up every time! \n Imitate your teacher inside your head. \n As you probably know, a regular song lasts at least 3 minutes, so this activity may keep you occupied for a nice amount of time, it will even make you learn the lyrics to your favorite songs ! \n Some teachers don't appreciate it if they notice it though. \n Twirl it, drop it, anything. \n This could be a bucket list or a shopping list. Whatever you want, just list it. \n You could then add them to this Wikihow tutorial (just check you're not repeating something already here). \n Add things to it that you'd never have a real hope of getting. \n Make it for a vampire, yeti or ogre going to the store., You could even plan your funeral. Write a will., Can't talk to your best friend? Pass a note! Just make sure it doesn't include any personal stuff. \n When they look at you, act all innocent and like you didn't do anything. \n Match people together whom you think would make great or terrible couples. \n Sure, it's not fun, but it will pass the time and you won't end up failing the class. \n If you are caught, though, it might be taken away. \n If you like reading, read the class textbook or something related to it. \n Might as well make your time there productive. \n 
 You probably won't be getting much sleep the night you go out. You could end up at an after-party with the band or doing karaoke with the DJ's aunt. Either way, you are probably not going to sleep early. Drinking also interferes with your ability to get R.E.M. sleep, so you probably won’t rest well when you finally do get to bed. Getting plenty of rest before going out drinking is essential. \n If you know you're going to go big this weekend, make sure you get adequate sleep during the weekdays to prepare.\n A night of drinking can disrupt your ability to stay focused, solve problems, and do complex tasks long afterwards. For example, drinking five or more drinks in a night can affect your brain and body for up to three days. If you’re planning to go out drinking, it's best not to choose a night that’s right before a test, major work project, etc. \n Taking a break now and then from drinking as an activity can also be a good idea. For example, designating one weekend a month as an alcohol-free period can help you rest and recover., If you drink on an empty stomach, you will feel the effects of alcohol much faster, which can mean your night ends too soon. If you eat well and drink plenty of water before going out drinking, your body will slow its absorption of the alcohol you drink. \n Eating beforehand stops you from feeling drunk as fast, but your body will still metabolize all of the alcohol eventually.In other words, you will still be affected by the alcohol, but you will not feel it as quickly. \n Good choices of foods and drink to consume beforehand include bread, meat, cheese, pasta, milk, etc. (all foods which will be digested slowly and/or are high in protein).Continuing to eat protein-rich foods while drinking will also slow your body’s absorption of alcohol. If you can, carry healthy snacks in your backpack, purse, or close by incase you need a snack to slow down alcohol absorption. \n Alcohol can impair your decision-making abilities, so it is a good idea to agree upon a plan for the night before going out. Make sure you and any friends joining you agree on where and when to go, and when to return. Make sure that everyone will have a safe way home at the end of the night. Sticking to a plan like this will help keep anyone from getting lost or separated and from winding up in a dangerous place or situation. \n If anyone will need a vehicle during the night, make sure that someone serves as the designated driver, or that a taxi or public transportation can be arranged. \n Protect yourself and others. Don't drink and drive. \n It can be easy to lose things when you are drinking, since alcohol can impair your judgment and short-term memory. Bars, clubs, and other locations can also be crowded, increasing the risk of loss or theft. To prevent this, leave unnecessary valuables at home and keep a close eye on personal items such as a wallet or purse. \n Drinking too fast is one way to ruin a night. If you have too many drinks in a short period of time, you may not realize how much alcohol you’ve had and end up sick or worse. Drinking no more than one drink an hour gives your body some time to metabolize the alcohol so that you don’t become too drunk too fast.Remember that all drinks aren’t the same. 12 ounces of beer, 8 or 9 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine, and 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor generally have roughly the same amount of alcohol.When keeping track of the number of drinks you’ve had, however, remember that the alcohol content of individual drinks can vary widely. A high-gravity ale, for instance, could have nearly twice as much alcohol as the same amount of a light beer. \n If you are having mixed drinks, make sure that someone you trust is doing the mixing, and not making them too strong. \n Drinking water in between alcoholic drinks helps you to stay hydrated and from getting to drunk too fast. Just remember “Spacers, not chasers!”, Going out drinking with friends can be a way of having fun if everyone is safe. It might even seem funny if someone winds up passed out on a stranger’s lawn wearing someone else’s clothes. It’s important to realize, however, that drinking too much can be dangerous and even deadly.Females are recommended to drink no more than four drinks at a time, and males no more than five. \n If you are drinking at high altitudes, remember that your body’s tolerance for alcohol may be lower.Avoid binge drinking, keg stands, and drinking games.These activities can cause you to drink too fast, lose control, become sick, or even experience alcohol poisoning, which can be deadly. \n If you are worried about drinking too much, or drinking too quickly, you can try showing up late to the bar, party, club, etc.That way, you’ll have less time to drink. You can also try starting with or switching to a soft drink at some point so that you drink less alcohol. \n This helps to space out your alcohol consumption so that you don’t drink too quickly. Alcohol dehydrates you as it is absorbed and metabolized, and this can cause a hangover. Replacing that water as you drink and when you wake up will help to ward off the dreaded hung-over feeling. \n Many bars have pitchers or containers of water out so you can help yourself. Make sure you locate this early in the night and visit often. \n If you are at home or at a house party, keep a bottle of water with you so you can hydrate throughout the night. \n Make sure that everyone knows the plan for the night, stays together, and makes good choices. \n Even if no one will be driving, you might want to designate someone to stay sober for the night. This person can help make sure everyone stays together and safe. \n If at least two people stay sober for the night (to be the DD or otherwise), it can be more fun for them, since one person won’t be left alone not drinking. \n You and your friends can take turns being the DD/sober person on different nights. \n If you see anything or anyone that looks suspicious during the night, stay away. Things to watch out and stay away from include: \n Bar fights \n Suspicious people \n Dark, isolated places \n This will ensure that you do not have a drink that has been “spiked” with a drug or other substance. \n You may also not know how the combination of alcohol and another substance will affect you, making it more difficult to stay in control of your actions and stay safe. \n Make sure that you can trust the people you are with and avoid making decisions you’ll regret later. \n Be prepared to practice safe sex if you think it might be part of your plans for the night. \n Even if you are drunk, or drinking underage, seek help if someone becomes injured, unresponsive, violent, or seems in danger of harming him/herself or someone else. Sensible authorities are more concerned with making sure that people stay safe and protected than with who's drinking what. \n 
 Grow your own, or ask around at produce stands or farmers' markets in late summer. Pickling cucumbers are smaller than most salad cucumbers, perhaps 1 to 1 1⁄2 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) in diameter and 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) long. Plan that 6 to 7 medium pickling cucumbers, or about one pound, sliced, will yield about 3 cups. Thus, for six quarts of sliced cucumbers, you will need about 8 pounds of cucumbers.\n Do not peel them. Measure the sliced cucumbers until you have about 6 quarts. Cut out any bad spots as you go. \n Leave them in half-rings, or if you prefer, aim for bite-sized lengths. \n Cover the cucumber and onion mixture in this brine. Let the mixture soak for three hours. \n If you prepare them ahead of time, store them upside-down on a clean towel, covered by another clean towel. \n Bring the vinegar, sugar, and spices to a boil in a large saucepan or pot. Then, add the drained vegetables to the mixture and bring the combination to a boil. \n Boil about an inch of water in the bottom of a wide saucepan. Remove the saucepan from heat and place the jar lids individually into the water. Let them sit for a minute or two. Do this immediately prior to use. \n Leave 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of head space (space between the top of the food and the jar rim). Pour the hot pickling liquid over the vegetables, leaving 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of head space. Stir the pickling liquid as you go to keep the spices mixed in. \n Use a lid wand to lift the seals out of the hot water. Center the seal on the rim of the jar. Screw on the ring so that it is snug but do not over-tighten. (The idea is to contact the wax sealing surface firmly without displacing it altogether.) \n Fill the canner with hot water until the tops of the jars are at least an inch below the surface of the water. \n The next day, check the seals by pressing down in the center. The seal should not move up and down or make noise when pressed. \n Clean the sealed jars with dish soap in room-temperature water and label them with the contents and the date. Allow the jars to dry thoroughly before storing them. \n 
 Breeding budgies takes time and isn’t easy. You need to cash out on supplies and feed, check on the budgies often, clean the cage daily and set aside extra time for caring for the chicks.\n The room should be quiet, protected from predators including pets, have no disturbances and the only person entering the room should be you. \n Choose one that is approximately two feet wide. The cage should be wider than it is tall (budgies fly horizontally), square-topped and have at least three doors: one for the food dish, one for the water dish and one for you to easily access the cage. You might need to cut a small hole in the cage for the nest box (see below for a nest box). \n Add bedding to the box. Suitable bedding include safe wood shavings or plain rolled oats. \n You’ll not only need to prepare items for the mating budgies but also for the budgies chicks as well. You'll likely need: \n A couple of perches. Make sure the perch is a natural wood and isn’t dangerous to your budgies. \n A few toys for the male budgie. Make sure you don’t have so many toys so that the cage is cramped and do not put the toys too close that can cause the male to get hurt. It’s also recommended that you do not put any rope toys in the cage as the budgies and fledgling chicks might get tangled up in them. \n A feeder. \n Water dishes including an extra one for when the baby budgies fledge. \n Budgie seed. \n Budgie pellets. \n A cuttle bone for extra calcium. \n Liquid calcium or crushed oyster shell (two of these calcium sources at least). \n A mineral block. \n Extra food for when the baby budgies fledge. \n Baby budgie food \n A small syringe \n A spare cage for when the chicks grow up. \n If your budgie pair have a big hatch you may encounter some problems with the youngest chicks getting cared for properly. This is why you have to prepare a safe and warm home for an abandoned or neglected chick. However, it’s a bit rare to get more than one neglected chick during one hatch. \n Good dimensions are: (9" (H) X 6" to 8" (W) X 6" to 7"(D) with an entry hole of 2 inches (5.1 cm) diameter). \n Make sure that it has a little dish in it so the eggs don't roll and get rolled out of the nest and away from the heat of the mother bird. This is important so the eggs don't get cold. A concave also helps prevent splayed legs. \n If you like, make your own nest box from coconut husks. A coconut husk makes an ideal choice as it is not only snug but also offers something to bite on should the budgie get such a notion. \n Locate three coconut husks. They need to be roughly the same size. \n Drill some holes in one of the husks. Make a hole in the top part of the husk, a hole on one side and another hole on the other edge. \n Repeat for the other two husks. \n Draw the husks together using bird-safe wire or string. Thread through the drilled holes. \n Make a hanger hole at the front of the husk. Or, make it wherever it seems appropriate. \n Hang the husk in the breeding cage. \n Add nesting materials to nest box (E.G. pine shavings). \n The pair must be older than 12 months but the hen younger than 3 years and the male younger than 5 years old. They should be healthy and have no deformities or illnesses such as splayed legs, french moult or similar. \n You could also buy a budgie pair that is from the same cage/aviary so that they know each other already. If you don’t buy a budgie pair from the same cage you will have to spend time trying to get them both used to each other and it will also take them quite some time trying to bond. Be aware they may be related and it is never a good idea to breed related birds. \n You can purchase healthy budgies from a local pet shop or from another reliable breeder. A good budgie pair should be alert, awake and making lots of noise whilst a bad budgie pair would be sleepy, huddled up and its eyes would be cloudy. \n When ever you aquire a new bird remember to quarantine it in a seperate room, in a seperate cage for a minimum of 6 weeks. This is very important in ensuring the bird is not sick and doesn't spread anything to your other birds if it is. Birds in quarantine should not be bred. \n If you are going to start breeding budgies you will want to breed from a healthy budgie pair that is being cared for properly. This way you will most likely have a successful hatch of baby budgies. \n Everything should be clean including the cage, bedding, feeders and water containers. Depending on the amount of budgies there is in one cage, it should also be spacious and not cramped. \n The feeders should be filled with feed and the budgies should be fed a balanced diet consisting of seeds, fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, etc. The water containers should also be filled with fresh, clean water. \n Budgies won’t breed until they have adjusted to the new surroundings and they also need time to bond. You will have to wait for at least four weeks for them to consider mating. \n Keep all details, including a phone number, close at hand. You never know when something will go wrong, so when it does, call. \n It’s also good to get your budgies checked out by an avian vet to make sure they are not sick and are suitable to breed. \n A good diet consists of fruits, veggies, seeds, grains, etc. You can also purchase a budgie seed mix and pellets that you can feed to your budgie along with the safe fruits and veggies. \n Be aware that budgies eat a lot more when the chicks hatch so you should give them some extra food when the chicks do come about. \n The water container (and feeder) should be next to the perch and it should also be cleaned at least once a week. \n Rinse the cage and feeders out, dispose of all bedding and get rid of the feed/water and supply fresh feed/water. Bedding should only be changed once all the eggs have hatched. While the chicks are small it will only need changing every few days, when they are older or it is a large clutch the bedding will need to be changed daily. Avoid using cleaning products that aren’t safe for your budgies. \n Do not disturb the budgies. They will do their "thing" in their own time, but disturbing them and constantly hovering over them is not going to help. You may not catch them mating, but if you do, let them be. If you don’t the female/hen will tell the male to get off and the mating will stop. The female budgie will soon lay about 4-6 eggs. \n Candling the eggs means that you will know which eggs are fertile and which eggs are not. You can find candling steps online. Be very gentle and avoid touching the eggs, if you are going to touch the eggs at least wash your hands first to prevent passing on bacteria to the egg. Candling every few days during incubation can also help to determine if any of the embryos die. Any Dead In Shell (DIS) eggs need to be discarded to prevent spreading bacteria to the healthy eggs. \n Be aware that this step is optional; it's recommended that you do your research first before deciding. \n The chicks will begin to hatch around day 16-21 so it is very important that you check the nest box daily. Try to do this when the mother bird is out eating or you can teach her to leave by tapping on the box before opening it. \n Gently check the chicks over for injury (scratches, bruises or missing down feathers), seeds/air bubbles in the crop (the sack at the base of the chick's neck). \n Check that the crop is full (bulging). \n Make sure no food is stuck inside the top of the upper mandible (top of the beak). If there is food, gently pick it away with the end of a matchstick or the quill-end of a feather. If the food is not removed it will retard beak growth. \n Clean off any poop and/or food from around the toes, beak, eyes, and other body parts with a soft, damp, and warm cloth. \n Remove/dispose of any dead chicks or eggs in the nesting box. \n If you see any problems with the chicks and the mother (E.G the mother isn’t feeding one chick) then consider hand-raising a chick or two. \n Chicks also mean poop, so the nest box must be cleaned out regularly. When the hen is out eating, remove the chicks to a small container lined with soft paper towels. Scrape out the soiled bedding and scrape away wet poops from the bottom of the nest box, then replace the nesting materials with fresh stuff. Gently replace chicks back. Make sure to be as quick as possible. (This should not be done until all fertile eggs have hatched) \n Simply put it in the box. The mother bird will nibble at it and immediately regurgitate this for her chicks. The babies may also take a bite or two, mimicking their mother. This helps with weaning later on as chicks recognise the seed as being food straight away. At 3 weeks old the mother may also stop feeding the chicks and the father will take over. This is completely normal however you will need to watch the mother and possibly seperate her as she may harm the chicks if she attempts to mate and nest while they are still in the box. \n When the chicks finally fledge at the age of 28-35 days old, put a dish of seed at the bottom of their cage. Though the father bird feeds them entirely at this stage, you want to encourage them to start eating solid food as soon as possible. It’s also a great idea to provide a bowl of chopped fresh fruits and veggies – fledglings love to explore and try new things! \n You should also provide a bowl full of fresh, clean water at the bottom of the cage for the chicks. Make sure the bowl is shallow and that the chicks can access it easily. If it is too big you can add some marbles to stop the chicks from drowning. \n \n Make sure that baby birds don't stay in there all day, Maybe take it out for a few hours a day so the baby birds can explore the cage and remember to eat and drink. \n Since you want chicks to stay with the male bird as long as possible it is best to seperate the mother. \n You can let the hen go on for a second round but often it causes a lot of stress on the breeding pair. When the last chick fledges, remove the nest box immediately and seal the hole where the nest box was. Perhaps separate the mother bird from the father bird and the chicks, as she may be a bit mean to her babies. \n Back to back clutches can be OK if the pair are in great health and have not already had more that one previous clutch immediately prior to laying again. It is best to give your pair a 6 months break before allowing them to breed again. \n Males will have a pink or purple cere (nose) and females will have white or pale blue. Guess what, you made a budgie happy family! \n 
 Keep in mind that it takes these seeds two to three months to sprout. You can bypass this process by getting a seedling or small plant from a nursery.\n Change the water each day. \n Plastic containers used for starts will allow for easy transplanting later on. Fill the container with soil and place the seed approximately 3/4 of an inch (2cm) or less below the surface. \n Depending upon your weather, you can place it outside or in a greenhouse. \n When at least one leaf has appeared, you can transplant it. If you have a variable climate, you may want to wait until it is more established to plant it in the ground. \n If you have been germinating the seed in a low-sun area, you will need to move it into the sun and slowly increase the number of hours of sunlight. If not, it will burn in the sun. \n Queen palms have shallow, grass-like root systems, so other features, such as concrete or structures can be placed fairly close to it. The queen palm also likes a small amount of shade., It should be the depth of the top and no deeper. \n Add sand or Canadian peat moss if the soil doesn’t drain well. \n Loosen the palm from the pot and then place the plant and the soil from the pot in the hole. Fill in the area around the plant with more soil mix. \n Water every other day for the next week. Use a bubbler or soaker to ensure that the ground stays moist. \n You will generally want to water three times per week in the summer and twice per week in the winter. Due to its grass-like structure, it must be watered more than most trees., The following are good guidelines: \n With temperatures below 85 (29 Celsius) you can water one to two times per week. \n With 85 to 100 degrees (29 to 38 Celsius) you can water two to three times per week. \n With temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), you should water four to five times per week., Use a slow release blend that contains magnesium, iron, copper, manganese and nitrogen. \n A healthy queen palm can grow up to six feet (1.8m) per year once established. It can grow to the height of 30 or 40 feet (9 to 12m). \n This is an indication that your plant needs manganese. This is unlikely to be native to the soil, so you will need to add more manganese to the soil at the first sign of this condition. \n 
 Maltese do like company and can bark or suffer anxiety related problems if they are left alone for long periods of time. Think about whether you can structure your day so that the Maltese is not left alone for more than 4 hours at a time. \n Be aware that because Maltese like to be with people, they can easily become over-dependant on human company and suffer from stress or "separation anxiety" unless trained from a young age to cope in solitude. To train the dog to do this means deliberately spending small periods of time away from the dog so that it learns to be alone. Be careful not to over pamper the dog as this can make it even more difficult for it when you're not there to fuss it.Most Maltese are friendly, outgoing, and relatively fearless but because they are small (4-7 lbs) and have delicate bones, they are easily injured. As a result, they can become fearful or aggressive. Keep an eye on them around larger animals, and show children how to hold the Maltese properly without squeezing or dropping him. If you have very young children, you might want to consider a sturdier breed like a Shih Tzu, Havanese, or Bichon. \n Be aware that the Maltese feel the cold easily. If your home is chilly or you live in a cold environment, then reconsider your choice of dog. Also be aware they have long silky coats, which needs daily grooming and will need to have their hair trimmed regularly because Maltese do not shed like most other breeds. Although this is an added expense (unless you learn to do it yourself), the upside is that the Maltese (like the Poodle) is a relatively hypoallergenic breed., If you can't commit to such a long term undertaking, or you expect your circumstances to change, then reconsider getting a dog , especially one that can live to be 14 or 15. Adopting a dog is a long-term commitment, not something to take lightly. \n There are thousands of Maltese breeders out there, but there are also plenty of purebreds in animal shelters. If you know someone with a Maltese ask where that person got it. Make sure that before you bring your Maltese home, that it gets along with other pets or children you may have. \n Make sure you see the Maltese puppy with his mother. If for whatever reason the mother is not present, walk away. This is a give away sign that the puppy is from a puppy mill and such immoral breeding programs should not be encouraged.Make sure your Maltese was socialized well as a puppy, as this helps make it become a confident outgoing adult. \n If you don't want to deal with the upkeep a shorter "puppy cut" looks cute on a Maltese. You will need to have him professionally groomed maybe once every six weeks but will still need to brush his hair daily using a nice, soft brush. Remove excess hair and untangle knots while the hair is dry or with a special detangler. Bathing him first will make the tangles worse. \n You may need to use a comb to get to the root of any tangles and knots. Remember to gently tease them apart. Take extreme care cutting out knots, as it is all too easy to nick the skin., You may need to bathe a playful puppy once a week, while a calm, older dog will only need a monthly bath.Wash its hair like it's your own, only be very gentle! Don't forget to clean your pup's face with a washcloth. \n Maltese dogs have white hair that is prone to tear staining. You will recognize this as the brown streaks down the face of a white dog. This happens when tears overspill onto the cheek and stay there for a few hours. Substances in the tear fluid oxidizes and change to that rust-colored pigment, which causes the staining. \n To avoid this, dry the area around your dog's eyes regularly. The amount of tear overflow varies with each individual dog and is more pronounced when they are teething. If the lower lid area or cheek are constantly wet, then wipe hourly. For dogs with less moisture from the eyes, you only need to wipe twice a day or when you spot gloop in the corner of the eye. \n There are various commercial products available for wiping eyes, but previously boiled water on cotton wool is perfectly sufficient. Dampen the cotton wool with the cool water and wipe away any moisture or stickiness from the eye area. Then finish with a dry piece of cotton wool to pat the area dry. \n Many people don't do this, but it is very, very important, especially for older dogs. This will slow up tartar formation and protect your dog's dental health. Start at a young age, so the dog accepts having its teeth brushed. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and toothpaste made for dogs. It can be purchased at any pet store. \n Be aware the Maltese are especially prone to the formation of plaque and then tartar formation. This irritates the gums leading to inflammation and infection. Ultimately this causes gum recession and the teeth to loosen, become infected, and fall out. \n If this is your first time, rub the gums and teeth with your finger. Adding some soft dog food can make this more pleasant. Brush your dog's teeth before bed. \n Alternatively speak to your vet about small-sized kibble that has a cleaning action as the dog chews. Be aware that canned food is more likely to build tartar than dry food, and speed up tartar formation. \n Maltese nails should be clipped monthly so they do not overgrow and get infected. Using a regular nail clipper, slowly begin to clip the end of your dog's nails, stopping before you reach the live center of the nail. If you are uncertain how much nail to remove, invest in a lesson from the groomer or vet tech. \n The nail has a living center made up of blood vessels and nerves, called the quick. If you clip too much nail away you will cut the quick, which is painful for the dog and causes bleeding. If in doubt, err on the side of caution and remove the minimum amount possible. \n The dog may be scared and will struggle. If this is the case, try feeding the dog immediately after the nail trim so that it sees its food as a reward for good behavior. \n Many Maltese owners trim their dog's nails when the dog is asleep. However, you need to be very careful or it could really startle the dog awake. \n This can be done professionally, but can also be done at home. Go into the outer ears with a Q-tip, but do not stick it into the inner ear. Just use it to clean the visible part of the ear. If there is wax of any sort, be sure to clean it out. \n Never put water into the dog's ears, as this softens the skin and makes it more likely to become infected. Instead, use an ear cleaner sold for the purpose. These are designed to dissolve wax and also for an excess to evaporate away, so the ear canal is not left over wet. \n The Maltese has a small stomach, so choose a premium food that is high quality. Take your vet's recommendation and also look for a food that has a named meat listed as the main ingredient. \n Feed him a high quality dog food and treats recommended by your vet. Always have fresh water and dry kibble available for your Maltese (unless the animal is an adult and is overweight). Maltese puppies can suffer from hypoglycemia, which can be life threatening, if food is not readily available. \n It may be that you are giving the dog too much food at meal time or that you are giving too many treats. Consult with your vet if your Maltese is putting on too much weight.He or she may have a suggestions for helping the dog lose weight. \n A Maltese, like all dogs, needs to be well socialized in order to become a well-rounded dog. While it is important to bond with your pup, its also important that the dog is open to meeting new people and animals. Expose your puppy to a wide variety of people and animals when it is young, so that it understands that this is a normal and enjoyable part of life.Maltese dogs that are not socialized can become either fearful or aggressive toward strangers. \n Although Maltese are good apartment dwellers and don't require a great deal of exercise, it is important for the dog's brain, socialization, sensory system, and enjoyment to get out. Even a fifteen to twenty minute walk can be a nice break for you and your dog.Maltese are adaptable when it comes to exercise. They enjoy walks but are also happy to burn energy in a restricted space, by playing games of fetch. Teach your Maltese not to jump off your bed or couch, though, as this can cause injury. The breed is vulnerable to knee injuries (luxating patellas). \n Be aware that a bored Maltese may turn to barking to amuse itself. \n The Maltese is an intelligent dog and loves to be stimulated mentally. Like all dogs, your Maltese needs to be trained to sit, stay, and come when called, in addition to being potty trained. Use positive reinforcement when training, as opposed to punishment when the dog does something wrong. These dogs respond much better to treats and love as incentive to do the right thing. \n Don't be fooled by their small size, they love the mental challenge of training. Indeed, some Maltese excel at agility training, albeit on a small scale, so don't write this off as an activity for your dog. \n Maltese dogs are beautiful animals that deserve to be treated with love and care. Snuggle with your pup often and show it that you care for it. \n Your veterinarian will be able to advise you as to which diseases are prevalent in the area, and which it is necessary to vaccinate against. Some states also require all pets to be vaccinated against rabies, in which case you must comply. \n Take your veterinarian's advice on preventative healthcare such as heartworm, and regular worming treatments and use them regularly., If your dog is a pet and not intended for breeding, then speak to your vet about desexing. This helps reduce antisocial behaviors, such as territory marking in the male. It also reduces the risk of certain diseases in the female, such as mammary cancer (if done before the second season) and pyometra (womb infection). \n This is a permanent way of identifying the dog as yours. Should it escape or be stolen, the ID chip allows you to prove ownership, and will help someone who finds your dog locate you (vets can read the chip and find you through the registry). \n

 \n Keep the Sumatriptan Autoinjector System out of the reach of children. \n Important things that you need to know: \n Autoinjector pen has a shorter name "pen" that is used by doctors. \n Follow these step-by-step instructions every time you use the pen \n Only use each pen once – do not try to use more than once. If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n Getting the pen ready \n   \n Before injection check that the liquid is clear. \n If it is difficult to see what is in the window, hold the pen up to the light and check. \n After injection, the plunger rod completely fills the medicine window.   If the plunger rod can be seen through the medicine window, the device is spent and cannot be used again. \n Pull the cap off the pen. \n Do not twist the cap. \n Pull it straight off. \n Keep the cap for step 7 7. Look inside the cap, check that the gray needle cover is inside. \n Do not use the pen if the gray needle cover is not inside the cap \n Do not try to put the cap back. \n If you try to put it back, this will damage the needle.   \n You are now ready to inject the medicine go to next step.   \n \n Sumatriptan can cause serious side effects such as death, heart attack, stroke, increased high blood pressure, fast heartbeat, changes in mental status like hallucination, agitation and coma, tight muscles or trouble walking, changes in the color or feelings of fingers or toes, decreased blood flow to arms, legs or intestines. \n Do not take sumatriptan if you have heart disease or a history of heart disease, narrowing of blood vessels in the arms, legs, stomach or kidney, uncontrolled high blood pressure, migraines that cause temporary paralysis on one side of the body or Basilar migraine, had a stroke or transient ischemic attack or other issues with blood circulation. \n Do not take sumatriptan if you have taken another triptan or ergotamine medication in the last 24 hours or are allergic to sumatriptan or its ingredients.   Please see additional Important Safety Information on the back. \n Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information and Patient Information. \n \n You will now see a small blue projection in the medicine window. \n As long as the blue circle is visible in the medicine window, the safety lock is de-activated; the pen could fire unintentionally Keep the pen pressed against your skin for the next steps.   \n \n You will hear a loud click (this indicates that the injection has started). \n Keep pushing the pen against your skin.   \n   \n Wait for about 5 seconds until you hear the second click. The second click indicates you that the injection has finished.   \n If you take the pen off before the second click, not all the medicine will be injected. \n Do not rub the injection site. If needed, you may cover the injection site with a bandage. \n Do not try to reuse the autoinjector pen. \n

Restaurant Food Taxes,... \n Consider whether to blame: \n Those who campaign against problems - but who actually created them and continue to make them worse: Career politicians with their daily inaction, or ineffective actions. \n Those who proposes the federal budget: The U. S. President and his office. Blame the White House for running the government badly. \n The ones who criticize the U. S. President for creating the deficits. \n The president proposes spending and the budget. He cannot vote for the laws or funds or force the Congress -- who does vote them up or down -- to accept his plans and/or budgets. \n \n It's their fiscal policy (taxes and spending). Congress sets that fiscal policy; plus they oversee and can indirectly influence or control monetary policy which is set by the Federal Reserve Bank. \n That 545 excludes the members of the Federal Reserve Board which was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency off onto a federally chartered, but private, central bank. \n That also excludes the special interests like organizations and lobbyists. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman, or a president to do one thing. If they offer a politician a large contribution to vote for their ideas -- the politician has the power to accept or reject it. But, no matter what the lobbyists promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he votes.\n If there is are unfair taxes: blame congress. \n Unfair red ink (overspending) is because they don't "put the budget in the black". Your taxes and fees have to pay for their decision, good or indiscretion. \n Wars, and undeclared wars -- when the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines are engaged it is because "the majority of the 545 allow that". Whether politicians are acceptable rests upon their power to declare war, and to rule on the way it is done. Of course, wars cost money and lives. \n Very high retirement checks for the 545 are because "they setup their perks" that way or do not object loudly enough. \n This supreme law of the land gives sole responsibility to the U. S. House of Representatives for originating taxes and spending (appropriations) bills. If the senate originates them, the House will not accept that. The speaker of the House who handles coordinating this responsibility is elected by House colleagues as the leader of the majority party in the House. The Senate can make changes and then it has to be agreed between the two. \n The Speaker and fellow House members, not the president, can approve any budget that they want. If the president vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they agree to with a 2/3 vote of the members. \n Complex domestic problem solutions and failings are largely traceable to those 545 people. Consider: \n Working through the ballot box by helping your candidates and voting for your ideals. \n Writing letters to officials, editors,... \n Calling talk shows on radio and TV: hold news and television shows accountable for not exposing bad policies that are not exposed. \n These cannot prevent their trying to do what they took their oath to do. \n They can be held accountable by you as one of their individual bosses. \n Working together you can vote great numbers of them out of office and clean up their messes. \n You're it! \n 
 Have the other person acting as a base do this, too. This will form a platform, in a square shape, for the flyer to stand on and catapult off of. \n Grab your own wrist and their wrist just below the wrist bones. Keep your grip loose and flexible. Too much rigidity will keep the toss from going anywhere. Adjust as necessary until you two feel comfortable.\n Keep your hips over your toes and your feet a little more than shoulder width apart. Always keep your back straight! If you don’t, you could injure yourself. \n Make yourself the height of the other base, if possible, by widening your stance (or having them widen theirs). The best pairs of bases are roughly the same height. What’s more, the taller you are, the easier it will be to hoist the flyer higher into the air – don't compromise height if you don't have to. \n When you’re practicing, take the time to make sure the flyer feels secure. Are her hands nestled into the crick of your neck and do they feel sturdy? How is her right foot placed on your hands? Is it centered? This initial stage is very important to the success of the stunt. \n Do plenty of basket drills before you go up in the actual stunt. Essentially, all you do is set up the flyer and stop when her feet touch your hands. If, in that position, her hands and feet are sturdy, centered, and secure, you're doing it right. Try to limit the time it takes to make the process as fluid as possible. \n The flyer sets up the stunt with her right foot on your hands and her hands on your shoulder. Then, the backspot is going to help hoist her whole body onto your wrists and hands. As her left foot touches down too (that's all her weight now), bend down slightly as if you’re starting a slingshot. \n There should be no jerky movements in this stunt. You and your base partner simply bend your knees and your arms lower with the rest of your body and her to accommodate her weight. It is one giant, slingshot motion. \n If you are jerky, do a practice drill. Do everything up until this point, and then mimic like you’re going to throw her into the air, stopping much before you actually would. This will help all of you get the timing of it. \n Straighten your legs and throw your arms up, giving the flyer as much height as possible using all of your body. Release the other base’s wrists as soon as you feel them moving away – don’t hold on. With a little flick of the wrists, she's into the air. \n The more oomph you put behind this movement, the more you use your entire body, the higher she is going to fly. As you’re dipping down with the placement of her left foot, take the power from your feet and drive it upward. \n You can even jump a little bit, adding even more height to your basket. Let’s say you’re 70 inches (177.8 cm) tall, with a thrust of 48 inches (121.9 cm). That’s a basket toss that’s 118 inches (299.7 cm) high. With a jump, it becomes 122 inches (309.9 cm) – and it all adds up! Each inch more is that much more impressive. \n She may move in the air and you’ll have to follow her below. If you threw her to the right or left (like a human bowling ball), you're going to have to catch her to the right or left. \n Of course, ideally, you throw her straight up, plant your feet, and she comes directly back down – you should barely have to move an inch. But if that doesn't happen, adjust your positioning to catch her. \n Make sure to stay in front of the other base at all times – you two should move as one. You'll be on one side of the flyer and the other base on the other. The flyer's arms should land around your neck. \n Absorb her body weight as she comes down, bending your arms and knees as she lands into your makeshift cradle. Aim for one arm around her back and one around her knees. \n To dismount, you have two options: \n From your dip, simply hoist her in front of you, slightly lowering your arm around her knees and pushing your arm around her back forward. She should then be easily able to stand just in front of you. \n From your dip, bounce her back up to where her feet can land in your hands again, and move onto a different stunt right away – another basket toss or elevator perhaps? \n Do whichever feels more comfortable for you. For most girls, nestling your hands in the crick of the bases’ necks feels the most secure. Your thumb should be on their collarbone and your fingers towards their back. \n Make sure you feel sturdy. If you don’t, adjust. Don't worry about hurting or strangling the bases – you definitely won't. \n Their wrists are interwoven to provide you with a platform to step up. Rest your right foot on the right side of the platform in preparation for the stunt. This is your starting position. \n When you're ready, the backspot will count off for you, cuing you for each movement. On cue, she will hoist you up to put your left foot on the platform, too. You will be in a crouching position. \n Put all your weight in your arms, taking the weight off the bases' hands. This will help send your body skyrocketing, allowing you to propel yourself, in addition to the bases providing you that effortless power. \n Don’t jump. You want contact for as long as possible to rev up and gain velocity. If you do jump, odds are your jump will be slightly off the timing of the bases, which will result in a choppy, unpowerful lurch into the air. \n You should mainly contact the bases’ hands with the balls of your feet – this helps you act as a spring instead of a dead weight that has to be hoisted into the air. It's also easier to point your toes from this position. \n Think of how you jump. Do you jump flat-footed? Probably not. When you're crouching on their hands, make sure the balls of your feet are where the brunt of the action is taking place, so you can lift off from there. \n When you feel the bases propelling you upwards and your feet are about to leave their hands, pull yourself up. While airborne, keep your back straight and legs locked out, so that your body is in a straight line. It should feel as if a cord is pulling your entire body along an even plane. \n You should remain in this position until you reach the peak of the toss. At that point you can hit a motion or do a trick.You want it to look as clean as possible from beginning to end. \n Keep your legs and hands tucked in so you don’t hurt those on the ground as you go up. A flailing arm or leg can do some serious damage. \n During a straight ride, put your arms straight in the air or in a high V and keep your legs straight. Point your toes and that’s it! \n A few options other than a straight ride are a toe touch, kick-arch, pretty woman, back tuck, full tuck, and many more. The higher you get into the air, the easier a trick will be (the more time you'll have to do it). \n Aside from the normal basket toss, a toe touch is the most common add-on. Do as you would normally do for a traditional basket, but instead of coming down riding up as a layout you will add a quick toe touch. \n Ride up as high as you can then quickly pull a toe touch, keeping your back straight. When pulling back into a layout then v shape, snap down from your toe touch quickly, it will look much cleaner than slowly coming down to your final positions. \n You also won't have that much time to get into your layout/v sit so snapping down will give plenty of time to land in the bases arms. \n Keep your arms up in order to wrap around the necks of your bases when you land (and to avoid knocking them in the head when you do). To pike, bring your toes up toward you (still pointed!), putting your body in a slight curve to be cradled. \n As long as you don't flail about and stay relaxed, it will be easy to catch you. Don't worry! At the very least, you'll land on them and they'll break your fall! \n This is a very complicated move to pull in a basket toss so practice the less complicated moves first. The whole back flip will be completed in one motion, so there's no snap down into the cradle. \n Once you feel yourself leaving the bases arms, start to rotate into your back flip, keep in mind most people don't grab their knees or tuck in the back flip. \n Most people come around piked, this makes it a lot easier to land in a V shape when you are caught. \n Once you’re cradled, the bases will bend down and place you gently on the ground (or they should if all has gone correctly). You can then resume the cheer from the safety of your own two feet. \n Or go back into a stunt. From a cradle, the bases can bend once again, and on the upward bounce you pull your feet in – they can then rest in the bases’ hands, ready for the next basket toss or elevator. \n Make sure you have a firm grip on her and can’t slide on her shirt, shorts, or skirt. If you need to, make skin-to-skin contact to be sure. \n Always be a bit tighter than you think you need to be. You are not running the risk of hurting the flyer or impeding the stunt if you're holding on tightly. In fact, that way you can give her more power. \n You time the stunt, keeping everyone in sync. \n For an eight count, “1, 2” should be the team getting into position. On “3,4” the bases bend their knees and the flyer lifts her right foot into their hands. On “5,6” the flyer loads in her left foot and the rest of her body and the team dips down. On “7,8” she is thrusted upward into the air. \n With everyone in position, instead, you can count, “1” for the flyer putting in her right foot. “2” for her left foot, “down” for the dip, and “up!” for throwing her into the air. \n You have the ability to put the flyer exactly where she needs to be placed – on the center of the platform the bases are making with their wrists. Make sure she's in the right spot for lift off. \n You are also the reason she can get into their hands in the first place. Without a boost from you, she won't even be able to get off the ground. Use your legs to hoist her into position and to put you into position for throwing her upwards. \n Straighten your legs, using them for power, to give her that initial thrust. With your hands still on her hips, drive her up into the air, breaking contact when you feel her moving away from you. \n Make sure to throw her straight up so she doesn't curve to the left, right, backwards, or forwards. Your hands guide her direction more than anyone else's. \n Sometimes the flyer doesn’t go straight up into the air and instead moves off in a different direction entirely. This is either because her weight was unevenly distributed or because she was veered into another direction by you or base propelling unequally. Because of this, it’s incredibly important to watch her so you can adjust your placement to catch her. \n Follow the bases, staying slightly behind them. You'll be catching her arms, back, and neck. \n The bases will be in front of you, catching her around her torso and legs, off to her side. You are behind her, catching her by her armpits – her arms will be wrapped around the bases’ necks. \n Make fists with your hands, so you don't end up slapping or poking the flyer or the bases. Your arms should jut out in front of you as you see her coming down, but your elbows should be relaxed. No one's body, including yours, should be rigid. \n You have two options: \n The bases will lower their arms around her legs, and she will go onto the ground. All you have to do is give her a little nudge forward with your forearms and then move out of the way. \n If she goes up into another stunt immediately, use your arms to hoist her up to where she can place her feet back into the bases hands. Immediately move your hands back onto her waist and send her up into another toss or an elevator. \n 
 It's good to have both a general regional guide, as well as a more specific guide for your area. You can never have enough field guides - the more images you have the easier it will be to identify a particular tree. Field guides can be obtained for free at your local library. Used bookstores can be another good source, where guides can be bought at about half the price. Another great resource is a plant identification terminology book. This will help you understand the language in the guide. If you're just starting out, focus on using mostly photos of leaves and bark and flowers and fruit to identify trees. Then move on to using keys and drawings, which are more technical and precise. Various guides can also provide fascinating anecdotal information about different trees.\n Anything planted in a garden, lawn, roadside, park, is often an ornamental. Ornamentals are garden varieties of native species that are dissimilar enough to throw you off, and make pinpointing an exact species very difficult. If you want to learn your area ornamentals, there are many guides for the horticulturist about planting and growing trees that will have enough images that you might just find your tree. There are not that many different native trees in a specific area, and they are easy to learn. But if you include the city ornamentals, you're talking up to a thousand trees planted from all over the world. \n If you have the time to sit at the base of a tree you want to learn, and pore over field guides - great. Identification takes a lot of patience and concentration. It may take at least 30 minutes of studying various guides before you've found it. If you cannot sit with the tree, take some photos and samples home with you. \n Pick a tree that has at least one, if not two easily identifiable characteristics - such as a leaf or flower or fruit. Bark is not so easy to go by, nor buds, or scars, or growth habit. Leaves are the easiest to use. Start with an evergreen. There are very few native evergreen broad-leaved trees in the U.S. This magnolia with its large glossy evergreen leaves in the South is a dead giveaway: \n The tulip tree with its huge vertical trunk and papery upright flowers, that remain all through the winter, is very common and easy to identify (the 'flowers' are the remains of the fruit axis, not actually blooms). It gives the tree a candelabra effect. \n A peach, a cherry, a plum, a hawthorn, a juneberry, a pear, are all in the same family, with edible fruit - the rose. Trees with pods are in the legume, (or bean) family, such as silk tree, mesquite and locust. There are not that many different tree families in any temperate region of the world - if you can group your trees in their respective families you'll be better able to understand them, and know their characteristics. Beech and oak and chestnut are all in the same family (the beech), and produce edible nuts. Cottonwood is really a gigantic member of the willow family, growing beside water and having deeply fissured bark, just like other willows. \n And the tulip tree is in the magnolia family - it has large showy flowers, just like magnolia, and look at a comparison of the fruit: \n Hackberries are in the elm family, and both the seed and flesh of the prolific berries is edible - they're much like candy, and can persist on the tree deep into winter in some varieties and locales: \n Or the flaky peeling bark of this river birch: \n The scarlet flowers stand out beautifully against the smooth gray bark. Red maple's twigs are also red. Its red keys typically don't last that far into winter: \n . . there are also old woody capsules from the previous year's fruit: \n . . and often holding on to their cones, such as the tiny 1/2" cones on this hemlock: \n There's an incredible amount of information about various tree species online, as well as lots of images - you should arrive at a dead certainty about the identification of your tree at this point. You will also find a wealth of anecdotal information, as well as what possible uses the tree has and any toxic or edible parts. Always cross-reference and verify from multiple sources the edibility of a certain tree - don't go by one opinion alone. That having been said, there are very few trees in the U.S. that are actually poisonous, such as buckeye and yew. \n Ultimately you'll create your own database of area trees, and become an expert. It will become an excellent reference source for you year after year, and you will come to know your trees from all angles, in all habitats, in all seasons. \n This is a great project for kids, and it spurs their interest in trees.

 Federal law requires the college to provide you with a list of required textbooks once you register for classes, so you should be able to find out which books you need well in advance from either the registrar or your professors. You should not need to rely on the campus bookstore to tell you.\n You might be able to find the occasional good deal at your campus bookstore, but in the vast majority of cases, you can find the books you need for a much lower cost somewhere online.Check out websites like BIG WORDS.com and Campus books.com, both of which direct you toward textbook sellers offering the lowest prices. \n Also check out websites that allow users to sell their own used and new copies of a book, like Amazon or Half.com. \n For many textbooks, you can buy an old edition at a lower price without facing too much difficulty. \n You might want to check with your professors before doing this, however, in the rare instance that there is a significant change in the new edition that you will need access to in order to survive the class. \n Renting your textbooks will not guarantee a lower price tag, but oftentimes, the price to rent a book will be cheaper than the price to buy. Look into both options and determine which will work best for any particular book. \n You can check your campus bookstore for renting opportunities, but there are also online sources, including Chegg, BookRenter.com, CampusBookRental.com, and ValoreBooks. \n If you really want to pinch pennies, you can check for coupons that allow you to save money on textbooks bought online. These coupons will rarely be specific to the publisher, but you might be able to find coupons for various online stores. \n If you know a friend who needs to buy some of the same textbooks, consider splitting the cost in half with that friend and sharing the book. \n Upperclassmen who are done with a textbook for good will occasionally sell it, and the cost is usually pretty cheap since they tend to be more interested in making whatever they can on the book. \n As long as the international edition is printed in the same language, this can be a viable option. Research carefully, however, since international editions can go either way in terms of cost. \n Check the cost of shipping, as well, since shipping costs on international editions can sometimes cause the overall price of the book to shoot up. \n Even if you plan to do most of your work on your computer, you still need a range of basic writing utensils for class time and study time. \n Buy blue or black ball-point pens and pencils for taking notes and filling in exam papers. \n Get highlighters to help you study. \n Invest in a couple of permanent markers and a bottle of white-out., Folders and notebooks are essentials, but there are a few other supplies that could come in handy that may not be quite as obvious. \n Consider buying a three-ring binder and a hole punch to help you stay organized, as well as subject dividers and loose-leaf paper. \n Buy a book bag or messenger bag that you can carry from class to class. \n The desk in your dorm room will need to hold a large number of supplies and papers, so buy tools and supplies that can help you keep everything in order—including your sanity. \n Consider buying: \n Sticky notes \n Personal organizer or calender \n Dictionary and thesaurus \n Calculator \n Rubber bands, a ruler, scissors, a stapler and staples, thumbtacks, and tape \n If you do not have one already, you should really consider buying a computer. Most of your classes will require you to type and print papers, and a computer can also help you with research and entertainment. \n Aside from a computer, check into buying: \n Printer \n Printer paper \n Ink cartridges \n Flash drive \n Find out if your campus has computer labs equipped with printers. If so, you might be able to skip the printer and save yourself the cost. \n Protect your tech. Buy surge protectors to protect your computer from any unexpected electrical surges. You can also consider buying an external hard drive so you can periodically back up the contents of your hard drive. \n Most dorm rooms are equipped with extra-long twin beds, so when you buy comforters and sheets, you should make sure that the size of the bedding you buy will match the size of the bed you will have. \n You will need pillows and pillowcases, bed sheets, a blanket, and a quilt or comforter. \n Also consider buying a mattress pad to make your bed more comfortable. \n Many dorm rooms are equipped with some form of lighting and mirrors, but it usually will not hurt to buy a few of these yourself. \n If your dorm does not come with one, buy a full-length mirror. \n Consider buying a desk lamp and floor lamp to supplement the overhead lighting installed in the room. \n An alarm clock is an absolute must, unless you have an alarm on your cell phone that you rely on. Even if you do use your cell phone alarm, having a backup alarm clock can still be a good idea. \n You should also buy supplies that can help you fall asleep faster so that you can wake up well-rested. These may include earplugs and an eye mask. \n Odds are, you can just bring the same clothes you wore throughout your high school years. There might be a few instances in which you will want or need to buy new clothes. \n Prepare for bad weather. Have a raincoat, rain boots, umbrella, and snow boots, as needed. \n If the climate you are moving to differs from the climate back home, buy clothes that are more suited toward the climate you'll be heading to. \n Some items you need to bring with you will not stay out once you get to campus, so you should buy a few storage bins to help you store any excess materials until you need them. \n Also consider buying temporary racks and shelving to store shoes, books, and other belongings that you need to access easily. \n While this is not a necessity, you should consider buying things to decorate your walls and door. This is the room you will be living in for the majority of the year, after all, so you'll want it to be comfortable for you. \n Options worth considering include: \n Bulletin board \n Posters \n Dry-erase message board and pens for your door \n If you have never owned your own suitcases, now is the time to buy a set. Purchasing your luggage in sets is recommended over purchasing it piece by piece, since a set will usually provide you with the best deal for your money. \n You will need a large bath towel and small washcloth, at minimum, but there are also a few other shower-related items you should look into buying.Purchase sandals or shower shoes to protect your feet from the bacteria left behind in communal showers. \n Buy shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. \n If your room has its own bathroom, buy hand towels, a bath mat, and toilet paper. \n Bring a shower caddy to store your soaps and other supplies. \n As a general guideline, any product or tool you use at home should be brought with you to college. If you were using your parents' supplies at home, you need to buy your own, now. \n Buy a hair dryer, flat iron, brush, comb, and curling iron, as needed. \n Also consider buying a razor and shaving cream to take care of facial and/or body hair. \n As with hair care products, any skin care product you use at home will also need to be purchased for college. \n Protect your skin with moisturizing lotion and sunscreen. \n Keep your teeth clean with your own toothbrush and toothpaste. \n Buy a new tube of lip balm. \n Keep body odor in check with deodorant. \n A first aid kit is a good idea for any college kid. You can buy a commercially-prepared first aid kit or buy the supplies separately. \n Supplies worth including are: \n Rubbing alcohol \n Antibacterial ointment \n Adhesive bandages \n Hydrogen peroxide \n Thermometer \n Aside from a first aid kit, there are a few other items you should consider having in case you get sick or otherwise feel less than your best. \n A few items worth buying include: \n Over-the-counter headache medicine, cold medicine, and allergy medicine \n Prescription medications \n Cough drops \n Eye drops \n In many cases, you will only need to worry about cleaning your bedroom or dorm room. In some cases, however, you might also be responsible for the dorm hallways, bathroom, or kitchen area, in which instance, you will need to buy cleaning supplies for these areas, as well. \n A vacuum cleaner, broom, and mop should all be on your college shopping list. \n Invest in a mini-vacuum cleaner, especially if you are only in charge of a small space like your dorm room. \n You will almost always need to wash your own clothes. Stock up on laundry detergent and invest in a hamper. \n Buy a collapsible hamper to save room. \n Purchase fabric softener in either liquid or dry sheet form. \n Disinfectant wipes are advisable, regardless of how much you will be expected to clean. Having disinfectant wipes and sprays can help reduce the spread of germs, which is very important in a compact space like a dorm room. \n Also bring along dish soap and glass cleaner, as well as clean rags that can be used for scrubbing. \n Even the most studious college student will need to unwind every now and then. Now is as good an excuse as any to stock up on any CDs, DVDs, or Blu-rays you've had your eye on. \n Skip the fancy sound systems, though, since you can get in trouble if you make too much noise and your neighbors file a complaint. \n Also buy a small TV to watch your movies on. \n You might love your music, but that does not mean your roommate or your neighbors will love it as much as you do. Headphones are important, so if you do not own any, buy them now. \n If you invest in noise-canceling headphones, you can also shield your ears from the music and sounds made by other people. \n If you enjoy reading, purchase a few books you can look forward to reading. Doing so can restore some of the joy of reading that might otherwise get lost amidst all the textbook work. \n Indoor and outdoor games can help you relieve stress and make friends, so if you do not have any games you can bring along with you to college, buy one or two now. \n Board games and card games are a great, inexpensive option. You can also bring a video game console, but do so at your own risk, since this could be stolen if you leave your room unlocked and unattended. \n Buy supplies for outdoor fun, too, like rollerblades, a frisbee, or a basketball. \n Many colleges have restrictions regarding the types of cooking instruments you are allowed to keep in your dorm room. Review these restrictions before making any big purchases. \n Items you should check on before buying include: \n Coffee maker \n Blender \n Microwave \n Small refrigerator \n Resealable plastic bins and plastic bags are important since they allow you to store leftovers and make your food supply last longer. \n Make sure that your plastic bins are microwave-safe. \n Forks, knives, and spoons are the absolute essentials you need to stock up on, so buy these supplies before you head off to college. \n You should also consider buying a can opener, funnel, and any cooking utensils (like whisks and mixing spoons) you might need if you plan to prepare your own food. \n Cooking supplies also include baking pans, saucepans, and frying pans. \n You will also need plates, bowls, cups, and mugs when you head off to college. \n Make sure that your dishes are microwave-safe. \n 
 Submit it to various search engines and directories. In addition to major search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Ask, Bing and MSN, it's worth submitting to lesser known web directories. If your website is listed in as many places as possible, it can boost your rankings in major search engines as well.\n Contact the owners of other websites with your proposal to exchange links. You will add their link to your links page, and they will link to your website in return. \n Visit the online discussion forums where people in your target market like to gather. Post useful responses to people's questions, and include a link to your website at the end of your post next to your name. Although you ultimately want to get your sig file with the link to your site seen as often as possible, don't overdo it with your posts, otherwise other forumites won't respect you, and therefore won't visit your site. \n Visit other people's blogs on the topic related to your website. Most blogs allow you to add comments about the issues being discussed. Add insightful comments about the blog topics, and leave your website link. Your comment and your link will permanently remain on the blog website. \n Set your e-mail program to automatically add your signature to every e-mail that you send. \n There are many types of traffic exchanges but the idea is the same - you team up with other webmasters, and they send you traffic in exchange for you sending them traffic. Search the web for "traffic exchange" to find those services. \n It can be a report with useful information that you allow people to give away. It can also be some kind of cool and unusual web-page that people will want to e-mail to all their friends. Of course, the pass-around item will include your advertisement and your link, spreading the word about your website. This is a "viral" strategy. \n Submit your articles to article directories, and allow people to publish your article in their newsletters and websites. Your articles will spread around the web like wildfire. People will read them and visit your website. The best part is that people who read your articles will regard you as an expert, and they will be much more likely to buy from you when they go to your website. How's that for a free publicity? \n The point of keywords is that they are the terms most people looking for your article by topic will search by. Check those with free Google terms and use the most popular relevant one in your title - a descriptive title to let them know right away what it is if it's a word with multiple meanings. Drawing blood for a phlebotomist is not the same thing as a comics artist drawing blood in a fight scene. Be very literal and then use the exact keywords several times in the article where they are relevant, as well as synonyms. Don't overdo it, or you look like you're trying to spam Google. Just use the keywords naturally when describing the topic. \n If it is a confusing keyword phrase like Drawing Blood, link to the other meaning and mention that in the first paragraph. "This article is about drawing blood in graphic novels. Phlebotomy is drawing blood for medical tests or donations - here's the other page on "Drawing Blood." Then link to the phlebotomy page in that. By redirecting confused people you leave them a good impression and they might stop to read your article if they also like doing comics art! \n When people read each issue they'll be reminded to revisit your web site. Submit it to all the free e-zine directories on the internet.A newsletter! \n It could be an online message board, e-mail discussion list or chat room. When people get involved in your community, they will regularly return to communicate with others. \n There are many of these on the net. Some of the more popular ones are craigslist, inetgiant, freeadvertisingforum, and gumtree. \n These are lists of subscribers who have opted-in to send and receive emails to each other. You can instantly reach potentially thousands of people by sending out emails, and you don't have to worry about receiving spam complaints either because everyone on the list has opted-in to receive emails. \n Your friend's friends will see when they join the fan page or comment on your status. \n All this socializing, forum commenting and question answering ought to be on your website's main topic. The more your activity and site content match in topic, the more likely the right people find it. The more targeted your affiliate links are to the topic, the better you'll do with them too. People don't mind advertising that's on topic, it starts to look like a convenience directory rather than irritating commercials. \n 
 Don’t think that just because you’re shy, there’s something wrong with you. Your partner chose you because they liked your personality, and your shyness is part of that. Even if it’s something you want to work on for your own sake in the relationship, never forget that you can be confident and powerful even if you’re shy. \n Never apologize for being shy. Explain why you’re reacting the way you are, say that you’re working on it because you want to, but never give anyone the impression that you owe them extroversion.\n Studies have shown that discussing your shyness-related anxiety can lessen the effects of it,and experts suggest that showing vulnerability is actually a good way to increase trust and intimacy between partners.Especially in new relationships, it's very important to have a conversation about your shyness at the outset; this will pave the way for easier conversations down the road that will make your relationship a lasting one. There’s certainly nothing to be ashamed of, so be open and honest about how you’re feeling when you feel yourself tensing up. \n Don’t bottle up your nervous feelings to deal with them later. \n Tell your partner how you’re feeling in real time. \n Don’t dwell on your shyness; get it out in the open, then move on to another subject when the feeling passes. \n Let your partner comfort you if they try. \n Instead of trying to connect with your boyfriend or girlfriend all the time, take enough time with yourself and with the friends and family you feel comfortable with to keep yourself happy. When you're happier, your relationship will have a better chance of working out. \n Many shy people find that it's face-to-face interactions that cause them the most anxiety, but that they can communicate by text or on the internet more comfortably.Most new couples don't spend all their time together anyway, so keep in touch through texting, Facebook, Twitter, and other methods of communication that will let you establish a relationship and get to know each other without all the anxiety of seeing the person in the flesh. \n \n Ask a platonic friend or relative who you're very comfortable with to go on a “date” with you. \n Go through all the steps: get dressed up, pick them up/have them pick you up, go to a restaurant and have a nice conversation. \n Familiarize yourself with the dating context, and try to remember that it’s all old hat when you’re on a real date with your partner. \n For example, you have to open up about your hopes and dreams, your fears and shames, and how you feel about your partner when you're first getting to know each other. Plan out the big conversations that you think you’ll probably have with your partner ahead of time, so that you’ll be ready for them when they come up. Having a sort of script prepared in your head will make it much easier for you to open up. \n Make lists of your fears, hopes, and other important feelings. \n If you need to have an argument, outline the rationale behind your side of the argument. Anticipate what your partner will say, as well. The better prepared you are for all possible routes of conversation, the more open and effective you’ll be as a communicator. \n If you can’t ever think of anything to say to your partner, then do a little bit of work when you’re alone to fix that situation. Watch the news, read books and magazines, and keep up on pop culture that you have in common — whether music, movies, or graphic novels — to ensure that you always have something new to bring up when you’re together. \n These “activities” might be as simple as accepting a phone call immediately instead of waiting for it to go to voicemail and calling back. \n Push yourself gently but surely into situations that put you outside of your comfort zone. \n Don’t rush yourself! Start small and work your way up to taking bigger steps, like spontaneous romantic vacations. \n If a romantic setting like a fancy dinner makes you nervous, then lower the bar. Go on a date where you won’t feel so much pressure to make a one-on-one connection, but can enjoy yourselves together in a more public setting. Depending on what your interests are, you might go to: \n A sporting event where you can be among a crowd \n A museum, where you can discuss the exhibits rather than personal details \n A movie or theatrical production, where you can spend time together without speaking \n That can be very stressful for a shy person! If you feel yourself tensing up around your partner, do a simple relaxation exercise to calm yourself down and put you in a better frame of mind. \n Take a deep breath and hold it for a count of four, then exhale, controlling your breath on the way out. \n Repeat until you’ve overcome your anxiety. \n \n The eyes are an important tool for communication, so rushing into a lot of eye contact might feel draining. \n Over time, practice making eye contact more and more frequently, and for longer periods of time. \n Practice on pictures and images on the TV, or with your parents if looking into your partner’s eyes is too intimidating at first. \n Looking anywhere in the vicinity of your partner’s eyes will still be comforting to them, even if you’re not making direct eye contact. \n It’s easier to make eye contact when you’re listening than when you’re speaking, so start with the easy stuff. \n Make a conscious decision to keep your body open. \n Let your hands sit at your sides. \n Push your shoulders back and your chest forward. \n Even if you’re not terribly talkative because of your shyness, that doesn’t mean your partner needs to feel alone when they’re speaking with you. You can engage nonverbally in a conversation simply by registering the same emotions the speaker’s having in a given moment. \n If your partner smiles or laughs, you should smile or laugh along. \n If they’re discussing something concerning, register their worry on your face. \n This will ensure your partner that you’re still engaged with them, not withdrawn into your own world. \n Some ways to nonverbally engage in a communication include: \n Smiling or laughing at appropriate moments \n Maintaining eye contact \n Nodding along \n By leaning forward and closing the distance between you, you’ll create a more intimate, secure mood in your relationship. \n 
 Blogs fall into various large categories, and considering some of these categories can help you narrow down your interests. Remember: for you to make money, people have to read your blog. Here are some popular blog genres:Personal blogs. Successful personal blogs almost give readers the impression that they know you. They can feel like a lunchtime chat with the blogger, or an insight into their daily life. If you are good at expressing your personality online, this could be a good genre for you. \n For a good example, see “The Bloggess,” a blog that provides a humorous and entertaining look into the daily life of a woman with social anxiety.Special Interest Blogs. These blogs can offer tips and tricks about your favorite hobby. They can share knowledge about a topic you’re passionate about. These work especially well if you have a unique perspective you can bring to your topic. \n For a good example, see “Curly Nikki,” a blog by a Black woman who is passionate about helping other women learn to love their natural hair.Another good example is the famous “Perez Hilton,” a phenomenally successful celebrity gossip blog focused on dishing the dirt about famous people.Industry Blogs. These are specialized to a particular field or industry. They’re a good choice if you’re already an expert on something and want to share that expertise. Because you have to constantly stay on top of new information and developments in that industry, you need to make sure you’re comfortable with researching and understanding your topic. \n For a good example, see “The Copybot,” a marketing blog by copywriter Damien Farnworth. He tackles how to write the best copy for online sites with lots of concrete examples and helpful lists.Political Blogs. If you have an informed perspective on politics you’d like to share, or you want to communicate your political views in an interesting, entertaining way, a political blog could be a good choice for you. Political blogs often take a particular “side,” but they don’t have to. \n For example, “PolitiFact.com” (a Pulitzer Prize-winning blog owned by the Tampa Bay Times) runs fact checks on important news stories of the day, assigning them a “truth meter” rating that helpfully breaks down inaccuracies in news reporting.Another example of a political blog is “Michelle Malkin,” a blog run by conservative pundit Michelle Malkin. This blog states the blogger’s personal political opinions in an engaging way.\n The best blogs focus on topics that you, the blogger, are passionate about. This topic can be anything that you believe you have enough to say about to interest others. It works best if you can find a “niche” that is not being fully exploited.There are several important things to keep in mind when choosing your blog topic:Who is your audience? There are millions and millions of blogs in the world, so it’s crucial that you know exactly who your target audience is so you can draw them in. \n What does that audience want? For example, if you’ve decided your audience is “stay at home moms,” you’ll need to consider the possible interests and needs of that demographic. Make sure you don’t just make assumptions. Look at other blogs that cater to your audience to see what they’re delivering. \n How qualified are you? Good blogs convey a sense of familiarity and ease with the material. Excellent blogs usually have bloggers who are personally qualified to talk about their topics. If you can’t think of at least 25 separate posts off the top of your head about your topic, you may not have enough familiarity with the topic to keep your content going. \n How sustainable is the topic? Make sure that you choose a topic that is likely to stay relevant in the future. You also need to be able to come up with new items to blog about on a very frequent basis. For this reason, try to avoid a topic that’s too narrow -- you’ll run out of things to say. \n How much competition do you have? Do some research to determine what already exists about your topic. “Celebrity gossip” is a hugely popular topic, but there’s also a lot of existing competition that could mean your blog gets lost. \n What is your ”spin”? To set yourself apart from the crowd, you’ll need to do something different and interesting with your content. Will you have an interactive focus? Focus on bizarre day-to-day news events instead of celebrity dish? Whatever you choose to blog about, make sure that you have ways to approach it creatively and that you can consistently offer new, exciting content. \n Your blog can be about anything, but once you have decided your general area of interest, such as “celebrities” or “parenting,” visit several popular blogs to see what they do. Pay attention to their blog design, what they blog about \n For example, the blog “Tom + Lorenzo: Fabulous & Opinionated” began as a small blog recapping and critiquing episodes of Project Runway -- meaning that it had a built-in audience and clear purpose from the start. It’s grown into a pop culture site with millions of readers offering TV and movie reviews, fashion critiques, and celebrity news.An excellent example of a successful personal blog is “The Pioneer Woman,” a three-time Bloggie award winner. The blogger, Ree Drummond, now has her own show on the Food Network because of the attractive, “down-home” way she presents her recipes and lifestyle anecdotes.Three-time Bloggie award-winner “Camels and Chocolate” documents the travel experiences of a journalist, Kristin Luna, and her husband. Her accessible tone and beautiful photographs, coupled with her skill in telling a “story” about her trips, make it feel like the reader is on the trip with her. \n Blogs can also take on a very particular, quirky lens. For example, “Crusoe the Celebrity Dachshund” won a 2014 Bloggie award. The blog is written as though Crusoe himself is writing it, and readers related to the lovable little dog and the concept of a dachshund talking about his grand adventures., Your domain name and blog title are your audience’s first exposure to your “brand identity.” In addition to letting readers know what to expect from your blog, your blog title and domain name will help place your blog in web searches, which is crucial for generating web traffic (and profit!). \n Make sure that your blog title fits with your overall blog “identity.” For example, if you’re running a dishy celebrity gossip blog, don’t choose a stodgy or corporate-sounding title. On the other hand, if you’re an authority on a business topic, you don’t want your blog name to be too informal.Selecting a good keyword can be helpful. Search engines function through SEO (search engine optimization), which ranks search results based on how many keywords they have related to the person’s search query. However, you don’t want to get so wrapped up in SEO that your readers feel your blog is generic. Developing strong brand identity is the best thing you can do to draw readers to your blog. \n For example, the hypothetical “haircare.com” tells readers what the blog is about, but it doesn’t offer any “angle” on what kinds of hair care advice your blog offers. The hypothetical “Frizzfighters.com” is still clearly about hair care, but it gives off a fun vibe through its alliterative name and communicates your strong brand identity (funky, focused on a particular hair issue, hip). \n Choosing an extension is also important. The extension is the “.com,” “.net,” or “.org” after a website. There are now dozens of extensions, but those three are the most familiar to English-speaking audiences and will drive the most traffic to your website. Unless you’re a non-profit or a similar type of blog, don’t go for “.org” -- a “.com” is the top choice, followed by “.net.” \n There are a number of popular blogging platforms around, including Blogger and Wordpress. Most experts recommend WordPress because it makes monetizing very easy.WordPress.org is a highly popular choice because you don’t have to know any coding to design a slick blog. 1 in 5 websites use WordPress. Note: WordPress.org is a full-service blog hosting site, but you have to register your domain name and get set up with web hosting first. Wordpress.com has limited features and provides you a .wordpress domain name for free, but you can’t put advertising or affiliate links on a wordpress.com blog.Blogger is run by Google, and is a free hosting site that requires just a Google account to start. Its designs are not as slick as those on WordPress. \n Other options include SquareSpace and Wix, which are website design platforms that will also allow you to create a blog. \n Make sure to investigate whether your platform supports custom domain names. The best blogging platforms will help you register your domain name and seamlessly integrate it with your blog. \n Each blog platform will walk you through creating a custom blog. \n It’s important that you create a design that reflects the content and image of your blog - from your font to your color choices, make sure each element of your blog's overall design is consistent with your blog's image. \n For example, cartoony art and balloon fonts might be fun choices for a parenting blog, but would be seriously confusing on a professional marketing blog. \n Consider hiring a professional designer, at least for your header and logo. You only get one chance to make a first impression.Most blog hosts, including Blogger and WordPress, have “themes” that you can install. These can sometimes be customized and give your blog a fun “feel.” \n Most blogs have common elements, such as “About Me” and “Archives” that allow readers to learn more about you and read past posts. Common features include: \n About Me \n Categories \n Posts \n Portfolio \n Contact \n Don’t clutter your blog! Make it easy for readers to find the content they’re looking for. Offer helpful elements such as a search bar and “popular posts” sidebar.A “splash header” can be a good way to quickly orient new visitors. It is a large banner area at the top of the page that mentions the most important content and offers a quick introduction to the areas of the blog readers will be most interested in.Add a “next and previous posts” feature. One way to build your readership is to keep your visitors hanging around! Adding “next” and “previous” buttons at the bottom of each post will drive your visitors to read more content. \n Good blogs speak honestly and openly about a subject you're passionate about. Be yourself and share your ideas with the world!Be professional! Even if your blog is about your personal life, make it inviting for readers by making sure you don’t have any proofreading errors or ugly designs. \n Be useful. Center your content on your reader, not yourself. This means that you consider what your audience can “get out of” each post. Look for a problem you can address, a question you can answer, or a story you can tell. Going on a five-page political rant may feel good, but it’s unlikely to create a valuable experience for most readers.Be personal. Writing in overblown academese won’t usually fly in blogs. Readers usually want to experience blogs as though they were having a conversation with the blogger. Develop your own sense of personal writing style and stick to it. \n Break your posts up into scannable “chunks” to invite readers to stay and read.For example, you can use a list format, or break your post up into short separate paragraphs. If you have a really long post, try using subheaders and block quotes to break up the text. \n Other design elements, such bolding important points and using italics for emphasis, can draw readers to the most important stuff quickly. \n Remember that most readers are not willing to invest a lot of time reading something online. Keep your posts easy to skim and still get the basic idea. \n You can have the best content in the world, but if your readers don’t recognize it instantly, it’s unlikely they’ll click through. Headlines are especially important because many readers will encounter your content through a feed reader, such as Google Reader, or content site like Digg. They may only see the headline at first, so it needs to communicate what your post will be about in an engaging, entertaining way.Create headlines that are useful but create a sense of urgency. You want your readers to feel like they need to discover this content.Play on readers’ emotions. You can do this by asking a question or challenging expectations. Sites such as UpWorthy are excellent at this type of headline, such as this real headline: “Most of These People do the Right Thing, But the Guys at the End? I Wish I Could Yell at Them.” Headlines like these tell a story and promise a surprise., Don’t announce your fabulous new blog only for readers to discover there are two lonely posts on it. Post 10-15 posts to start with, and queue another 10 or 15 to post on a regular basis.Consistency and quantity of content are crucial in developing a readership for your blog. If you don’t have a lot of content up when readers visit, they aren’t going to stick around or revisit. \n You need to make sure that you post frequently. Prewriting posts and queuing them to post later is a good way to make sure that you have consistently updated content. \n Many blog readers subscribe to blogs through RSS feeds, which provide them automatic updates when you make a new post. Post a clear link or icon on your blog to let visitors know how to subscribe., Once you have the basics down, you’ll continue developing and learning more. It can take a long time for you to develop a big readership, so stay patient and keep posting., Register as a member using "yourblogname.com" as your username and post comments on related blogs This will drive traffic to your own blog.Build links to your blog by posting comments on other blogs that have “dofollow” links which means that search engines will see those links. \n Don’t just hawk your blog in your comments! This can come across as selfish and spammy. Make your comments interesting and thoughtful. Remember, you’re making your first impression in the comment! \n If you’re a great writer with something to say, a guest post on another popular blog can be a helpful way to get your name out there. Check out some popular blogs in your genre and see if they have a guest post option.If you don’t see any information about guest posting, don’t despair. Read through the blog to see if there have been other guest posts. If there are, contact the blogger and explain who you are and what you’d like to write. If there aren’t, you can still contact the blogger to see if it’s something s/he would be interested in. \n Mentioning prominent figures in your area or genre can accomplish several things. It shows your readers you’re “in the know” about the important people in your field. It may also encourage the prominent figure to look at your blog, or even promote it to her/his own followers.Don’t just name-drop. Make sure to incorporate these names in an organic, purposeful way. For example, if you were writing a post about mommy blogging, mention a blogger who has interested you, or whose blog you find amazing. \n Link, link, link! Link out blogs that you love in your own posts. Many bloggers track where their visits come from and may even visit (and link!) your blog in return., These days, if you’re not on social media, you’re missing out on major readership. Post a link to your latest article in your Twitter bio and ask for “retweets,” or link your content to your public Facebook page. Don’t just replicate the same content over and over, though. Use social media for quick, attention-grabbing posts and your blog for longer, more engaging content. The following are popular social media sites:Twitter \n Facebook \n LinkedIn \n StumbleUpon \n Digg \n Reddit \n Pinterest \n Giveaways are a great way to drive traffic to your blog. Readers love getting something for free! Giving away products from companies offers the free advertising, so contact some companies that are relevant to your blog and see whether they’d be interested in sponsoring a giveaway.You can also write to another blogger who sponsors great giveaways and ask for a contact or two. \n Make it easy to enter the giveaway. Asking readers to leave a comment on a post with their name and contact information or asking them to republish a link on social media are good ways to drive entries. \n The newsletter may seem old-fashioned, but it’s actually a powerful marketing tool.There’s nothing like the power of directly connecting with people. Below are some other methods to consider:Add a link to your email signature inviting people to check out your latest post. \n Send your blog post to people who might be interested in reading it. Don’t just spam your contacts here. Sending a link to your post to people (or other blogs) who might have a real interest in your content can get you new followers, especially if you offer to reciprocate by reading or reblogging their content. \n Participate in blog carnivals. Search online for them or check out BlogCarnival.com. \n Join a LinkedIn group. Particularly if you’re writing a more “professional” or industry-based blog, posting a blog in a targeted Linkedin group can gain you valuable exposure. \n SEO (search engine optimization) is very important, but it’s more than just repeating a bunch of keywords. Include a search-engine-friendly headline, such as “How to” or “Ways to.” Repeat significant keywords in your post, but make sure you don’t sound overly spammy.Google and most other search engines no longer operate strictly on SEO. They want to prioritize quality content, which means that providing clear, well-written, valuable content that links to other credible sources is your best bet. \n Creating a video for marketing is much easier than you think. The best software used for making a video is Animoto. \n Placing ads can be an excellent source of revenue for your blog. With “pay per click” (PPC) ads, you get paid when visitors to your blog click on ads that lead to other clients. You usually need to already have a strong readership and high visitor counts for ad buyers to be interested in your blog. Here are some examples of websites that pay you to place ads:Google’s AdSense program is the most widely used PPC program because it has the power of Google Search behind it. Google will read your article and find "ads that are relevant" to it and display them next to or within the article. It will also use your readers’ cookies to display ads that are relevant to their recently visited websites on your blog.You can also sign up for “cost per impressions” (CPM) ads. These function similarly to PPC, but they pay you based on units of “impressions” (views) the ad gets, even if the visitor doesn’t click on the link. Usually, the units are sets of 1,000 impressions.If you don’t have about 10,000 unique visitors to your site every month, you aren’t likely to make much money from ads. That’s why it’s crucial to build up your readership through marketing and quality content., Affiliate marketing is a very popular way of monetizing a blog because it capitalizes on your readers’ trust of you. If your posts always deliver quality content, then your audience is more likely to trust product or service recommendations. You can provide links or recommendations to relevant products and get a commission from any sales driven by your blog.Amazon Associates lets you place a banner on your website with products targeted at your audience, such as diapers for a parenting website or art supplies for a creative website. You earn a small commission when people buy something through your link. Amazon pays a commission ranging from 4% to 15%. \n Amazon is the giant in the industry, but it’s also a good idea to reach out to small companies and even individuals who make products or services that are related to your blog. For example, if you have a popular cooking blog, you might contact small BBQ sauce companies to see if they’d be interested in setting up an affiliate marketing program with you. You earn a portion of the sale through your blog, and they get free marketing.You can also check out other affiliate programs at big “clearinghouse” sites such as Commission Junction, LinkShare, and ShareASale. These sites offer huge lists of programs, from which you can choose the ones relevant to your blog.An affiliate aggregator service, such as VigLink, will automatically insert monetized affiliate links into posts for you. They keep a higher percentage of the commission than other services, but the convenience may make up for it., If you already have a high visitor count, you may be able to get other companies to pay you to “sponsor” a post. The advertiser may contact you directly, or you can check out online “sponsorship marketplaces” such as "themidgame".Be careful about sponsors who want you to place an article to increase their own page rank. This violates Google’s policy and could hurt your AdSense revenue.You can also check out websites such as Blogsvertise, Social Spark, and Review Me for listings of paid or sponsored posts.Don’t allow sponsored posts to overtake your own content. Remember: your readers visit your blog to read your content. \n Make sure that you only post sponsored posts that still benefit your readers in some way. You don’t want your blog to seem like a corporate shill. \n Working directly with a company to help with a promotional campaign can be a good way to boost traffic and revenue for your blog. Many companies, particularly ones like publishers, are happy to pay you to participate in things like Twitter parties, blog-based “book tours,” and giveaways.For example, if you run a popular blog where you review romance novels, contact various romance publishers to see if they’re interested in paying you for a review or other promotional event, like an author interview. \n Signing up with third-party connecting agencies can be helpful. Blog Friendly PR, Blog Insiders, and Brandfluential are popular networks., This type of revenue comes from providing sales “leads” to other companies who partner with your blog. You don’t actually have to sell a product or service to generate these leads -- you just need your blog visitors to provide their information and opt in to being contacted by your partner.For example, if you run a popular DIY blog, you could partner with a home supply store. If your visitors agree to be contacted by the home supply store, you could get paid by the company for generating that “lead.” \n You may be able to use your blog to create freelance income by using it to showcase your work. Don’t use your blog only to sell products, but having a “portfolio” section on your blog can let readers see what you’re good at.For example, if you run a photography blog, keep a portfolio of your very best photographs and market yourself as a freelance photographer. Readers will know exactly what they’re getting because they can see your passion and expertise. \n Blogs can also be very helpful even if you have a full-time “day job,” such as an attorney. For example, writing blog posts that offer helpful law advice and information will demonstrate to readers that you know your field. It will also give a sense of who you are personally, which is very important to prospective clients. \n Once you have a loyal following and have demonstrated your trustworthiness, you can consider adding “paid content” to your blog. For example, you could host a special podcast or write an e-book and charge visitors a small fee to access it.Paid courses, consulting services, and advice are other popular types of products and services you can use the reputation you’ve established to sell.You can also use a service such as Zazzle or CafePress to create branded items like t-shirts and tote bags for sale.The Bloggess creates new items weekly, usually playing on a humorous post from the week before. \n Consider memberships, where you charge a small monthly fee for users to gain access to exclusive content, video content, or possibly direct access to you through Q&A or live events. WordPress has many plugins to help you add membership services to your blog. \n Consider “bonus content.” For example, if you run a podcast on your blog, you might consider having the standard episode available for free but a longer version or additional content for a small fee. Dan Savage’s extremely popular “Savage Lovecast” runs on this model, where standard episodes are free and “magnum episodes” (longer, with no ads) are available for a subscription fee.Many bloggers parlay their blog’s success into books. The “Cake Wrecks” blog has several popular books of disastrous cake photos,and The Bloggess now has two books about her life adventures.The “Tom + Lorenzo” bloggers wrote a tongue-in-cheek “how to guide” to becoming a celebrity.Remember: anything you can offer that’s valuable to your readers might be worth them paying for. Just don’t let your blog become so paid-content-heavy that it doesn’t seem like a good value to your audience anymore.
 \n \n However, note that the whole face is slightly tilted. \n It should be just wide as from eye to eye. \n Make this curves quite thick, and quite far above the rest of the face (so the eyes are nearly mid-way between the smile and the brows). \n However, it may be easier for you to judge the curve of the head first then re-draw the eyebrows. The head curves a similar amount to the mouth but the other way round. \n Extend it down as far as the bottom of the smile, note how it flicks out at each end. \n The smile should be roughly in the middle of the face now. \n Use the eyebrows to guide where the ear should go. It is hard to describe the shape of the ear, except it is similar to the shape of a "liver". Use the image as a guide. Note that the ear points up towards the sky. \n It is the same shape as the left ear rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise. \n The neck is the same width as the distance between his eyes (pink line) and the widest of his right hip is directly vertical to his right cheek. His body is teardrop shaped but slightly curving so his left hip is less protruding. \n His leg becomes slightly wider at the bottom. \n His heel joins seamlessly to his leg but the top of his foot slightly extends past where it joins the line of his leg. \n A similar shape to his right leg but more vertical (although the lines you need to draw are still slightly curved). \n Start at his neck (on the left side of your page) and draw an "r" shape until it joins his hip. \n His hand should be just under his mouth and the bottom of this shape should be a little higher than the bottom of the "r" in the previous step. \n Each stripe curves to make his body appear rounded. Also note that the stripes become gradually wider, until the last one which becomes slightly thinner again. About 8-10 stripes is the right amount. \n You need 3 shades of pink. The lightest for his face, arms and legs. The middle shade for his ears and the darkest for his body. \n 
 Do the mission after robbing the bank (the mission furthest away from the hideout) so that you have a police bike. It will stay there when you reach the store and there is enough time to switch to it., They will still be there., Get an early lead by taking the shortcut through the grass on the right (but don't slide out.) Using the Buffalo is fine for this one. Go fast during the straights, but take the turns safely., For the farm, go to the left of it, sliding along that wall. Be careful on the next bridge also, and the next downhill, towards the water. And watch out for the bump in the grass on the last turn, going up the hill. You can use that as a guide for making that turn easier too., (You can use that bump to help you turn also.), That will put you well ahead of the rest of the cars., It will be easy to win the race once you're ahead of the competitors. The main thing is not speed here, but to simply not crash, or to go a wrong way, etc., For the farm, go between to the two buildings to the right of the corona, but watch out for the fence afterwards., The car doesn't turn as well if you're holding down the accelerator button.
 A primary color is a bright color that is useful for mixing other bright colors but cannot itself be made by mixing other colors. Yellow is the perfect example. Try mixing yellow from orange and green, and the result is very "dirty," not yellow at all. And yet we can use yellow with red to mix orange or with turquoise to mix green. This definition provides the rationale for the steps that follow. \n For example, if you have a set of poster paints, arrange them like this: red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, cyan, blue, purple, magenta. Don't include any light, dark, or dull colors. No black, white, gray, brown, light pink, light blue, wine red, hunter green, navy blue, etc. Make sure your colors include all the candidates: yellow, orange, red, magenta, purple, blue, cyan, and green. \n Now paint a sample of each color, arranging them around your circle in rainbow order as determined in step 1. Make sure they go all the way around so that your first and last colors wind up next to each other. \n For example, try to make yellow by mixing orange and green. Try to make green by mixing yellow and turquoise. Continue around the entire circle, painting a sample of each mixture next to the color it's supposed to be. \n The human eye has three types of color-sensing cone cells, which means that for those of us with normal color vision there are three primary colors. Yellow made from mixing orange and green is an obvious "dirty" result. The other primary colors may not be as obvious as yellow. In the photo above, which are the two other mixtures that look "dirtiest" in comparison to what they are trying to be? Those will be the other two primaries. \n In the exercise above, you should have discovered that magenta, cyan, and yellow are the colors that cannot be mixed and therefore are primary. These are the colors used in photographic and computer printing. Here we will test this trio against the traditional red, yellow, and blue. If you are using artist colors, try transparent quinacridone magenta (PR122) and transparent phthalocyanine blue (PB 15:3 or 15) for magenta and cyan. If you are not using artist colors, that's fine too. Just look for colors that are a good match for the magenta and cyan inks used in printers. You can find color swatches on end flaps of many food boxes, and look for paints to match them.\n Compare your result to your red paint, and see how well you can match it. Remember, if red is a primary color, you should not be able to make it by mixing other colors. If you can make red, then maybe magenta is the real primary color, not red. And, if magenta is a real primary color, it should work to make both reds and oranges when mixed with yellow, and to make blues and purples when mixed with transparent cyan. Try it! \n Remember, if magenta is primary, you should not be able to mix it from other colors. Compare your result to your magenta paint, and see how well you can match it. Is your mixture dark and dirty looking? That would indicate that magenta is a primary color. \n Compare your result to your blue paint, and see how well you can match it. Remember, if blue is a primary color, you should not be able to make it by mixing other colors. If you can make blue, then maybe cyan is the real primary color, not blue. And, if cyan is a real primary color, it should work to make lots of different greens when mixed with yellow, and to make blues and, yes, even purple, when mixed with magenta. Try it! \n Remember, if cyan is primary, you should not be able to mix it from other colors. Compare your result to your transparent cyan paint, and see how well you can match it. Is your mixture dark and dirty looking? That would indicate that cyan is a primary color. \n If red and blue can be mixed from other colors, and magenta and cyan cannot (or in any case your results are very "dirty"), the latter two must be the correct primary colors, not the former two, despite what we all were taught in third grade. \n After following the above steps, it should be obvious that if magenta, not red, is the primary color, then it does not make sense to "split" our primary by calling magenta "red with a blue bias" and keeping red as our "red with a yellow bias." Red as a primary color is simply an outdated and invalid idea, since red can be made by mixing magenta and yellow. If we cannot find an ideal magenta, a valid split primary would be two magenta's, one tending toward purple, the other toward red, PV19 and PR122 for example. Similarly, if cyan is the primary color, and not blue, then we should stop calling cyan "blue with a green bias," since blue has nothing to do with it. True blue can be made from cyan and magenta, and is not a primary at all. \n Just because red and blue can be mixed from other colors does not mean you need to throw them away. For example, you may be able to make a brighter orange with red than with magenta, since mixing paints closer to each other in hue gives generally brighter results. Plus, why go to the trouble to mix primaries when you have other colors that are ready to go? \n Having correct primary colors is mainly important for when you need bright colors such as purple, pink, and turquoise. Often bright colors are not needed in fine art paintings, but are more necessary when making craft projects or for children's art projects. In either case, colors you can mix from cyan, magenta, and yellow are most likely going to be bright enough. Because primary colors allow you to paint with only three colors, plus white, they can save you money when it comes to buying paints. On the other hand, keeping red, blue, purple, orange, brown, and black paint around can mean less mixing, which saves you time (and possibly frustration). \n This way you can discover which one is best for mixing the various colors. Try paints with pigments PB15, PB 15.3, etc. Steer clear of paints that include white pigments (PW). \n This way you can discover which one is best for mixing the various colors. You can try paints with pigments PR122 and PV19, for example. Steer clear of paints that include white or blue pigments (PW, PB). This information can be found on the back of most artist colors. \n The best cyan and magenta pigments is a hot topic these days. Using transparent colors will keep your mixtures from looking chalky or muddy. \n 
 Collect your ingredients accordingly. \n If you’re using a box brownie, you’ll probably also need a couple eggs, some vegetable oil, and some water (generally). You may use the back of the box for this step! If you’re making brownies from scratch, there are a range of recipes available. The subsequent steps explain one of the options!\n Remember that flour is light, so you should not stir in all of the flour at once. Start with 1/2 cup, then 1/2 cup, then 1/4 cup to make sure you don’t lose any flour. \n If you would like to use baking powder instead of baking soda, use about ½ teaspoons of baking powder. \n While the brownie is still warm, use the bottom of a wooden spoon to poke small holes into the brownie. \n You may make as many or as few holes as you want. Ideally, do about 35 holes, 5 down and 7 across. \n Put your 30 pieces caramel, ¼ cup of milk, and 1/8 stick of butter or margarine into a pan on put it over low heat until smooth. \n You may also heat the caramel up in the microwave, putting it in for 1-minute intervals until smooth, stirring between intervals. \n As soon as the caramel is smooth, pour it over the brownie while the brownie is still in the pan. You should use a spatula to spread it evenly over the entire brownie. \n It should be left in the fridge for at least an hour to cool off. \n While your brownie is cooling off, put your candy on a cutting board and cut it up into small pieces. \n This step may also be done later, if you would prefer. \n Once the caramel brownie has cooled off, and the caramel is partially hardened over the brownie, take the brownie out of the fridge. \n Cover the entire brownie with the whipped cream, making it as thick or thin as you would prefer. \n If you have not chopped up your candy, you should now do it. Make sure the pieces are relatively small. When they are at the size of your preference, sprinkle them over the top of your cream pie to finish it off. \n You may want to put your brownie back in the fridge if you do not serve it right away. The whipped cream melts rather quickly, so it’s best if served cold! \n
 You will need to take this nationally standardized test for entrance into any graduate program--master's or doctorate. The current GRE has a verbal, math, and essay section. Most humanities departments, such as English and/or Literature, will focus on the verbal and writing scores.Acquire a practice test and take some sample tests to help get a better score on the actual test. \n Check your prospective program's guidebooks, usually on the department's website, for average accepted scores, as the scoring scheme on these tests changes from time to time. \n GRE scores are valid for 5 years after the year in which you took the test. The year runs from July 1-June 30.If your scores are more than 5 years old, you will likely need to retake the GRE. \n Submit the scores on your tests to the correct school(s) you are applying to during the actual test. You can order up to four scores at the time that you take the test. If you are applying to more than four programs, you will need to order additional score reports for a fee.\n Not all doctoral programs require this subject test, but many do. Check the website or contact your prospective program's graduate coordinator to find out whether you need to take this test. If you do, you will almost certainly need to take it in addition to the GRE General Test.This subject test consists of about 230 questions that cover the full range of literature in English, including a few questions on important works of "world lit" that are routinely translated into English, such as Homer's Iliad or the Christian Bible.The test also covers basic knowledge about important cultural and historical contexts, as well as literary criticism. \n The subject test is only offered on paper and is only offered at certain times of the year, which means that you need to schedule your exam well in advance. Additionally, you should allow up to six weeks for your scores to become available to your chosen graduate program(s)., The humanities can cover a wide variety of subjects. You do not have to have a master's degree in English to apply for an English Ph.D. program, but you should consider getting your earlier degrees in topics related to English/Literature.Some Ph.D. programs will admit students directly from undergraduate programs, without requiring a master's degree first. You can investigate this option too. \n Look through your prospective master's program's degree offerings for an English and/or Literature department. \n Contact the graduate coordinator for the master's program you're considering to see if she recommends the program as a starting point for an academic career in English and/or literary studies. If not, she may be able to direct you to better departments or programs. \n Look into related fields like history, anthropology, philosophy, and theology for potential leads on programs and classes that will benefit your breadth and depth of study. \n If your master's degree is in a completely unrelated field, such as computer programming, don't despair. English is a very flexible field and welcomes people with all types of backgrounds. However, you will need to carefully and convincingly explain why you want to do a Ph.D. in English and how your experience has prepared you for the program. \n If you're already in a master's program for English/Literature, you might ask about staying at your current school for the doctorate degree. Some schools will allow students to combine some master's degree achievements into their doctorate program.If you have a "fast track" option you can and want to pursue, ask your advisor if you're in a position academically to move onto it by your program's deadline. Some will admit you only if you intend to pursue a doctorate. \n Acquire an accurate list of the requirements of the doctorate program in comparison to your existing master's program. This likely means increased credit hours, differences between a thesis and a dissertation (the final written composition you will produce), and changes to your course selection. \n Even if you do not have a "fast track" option, you may investigate the choice of staying in your current school for the Ph.D. after achieving your master's degree. However, this may require a fresh application, just as if you were a new student to the school. \n Most humanities doctorate programs in the United States, English/Literature included, require at least reading knowledge of at least one foreign language. If you are considering a prestigious graduate program, you may need to demonstrate competency in two or three languages. \n If your thesis or dissertation involves incorporating multinational and older works, you may need additional languages beyond the program requirements. \n Check your prospective program's course lists for what languages are regularly offered. \n Get a schedule of when the official knowledge reading exams or equivalent tests are given each semester. \n Consult with your prospective program about their requirements for passage of the language credit, especially if a class or just an exam is needed to pass the credit. \n The thesis is the major writing composition at the end of a master's degree. These projects, at least for the master of arts in English/Literature, are lengthy original works in poetry, fiction, drama, rhetoric and/or similar genres.Choose something that will inform your dissertation later. Don't "reinvent the wheel," as this will take you too long. Write about something that's already been done but look for new inspiration for your subject matter to write about or find a different angle within an established topic. \n Keep a portfolio of all your work. This will be helpful in applying for doctoral programs, teaching jobs, and/or other forms of employment should you pursue them. \n Look at your prospective schools' department lists to see if they have an English/Literature department.You may want to take popular rankings systems, such as U.S. News & World Report's "Best Grad Schools," into account.Take a close look at the faculty list of the top few programs you are most interested in and narrow down the list to professors that cover the sub-fields of English/Literature you are interested in.Consider highly ranked schools first. Students who earn their doctorates from the top 10 programs are significantly more likely to find tenure-track positions after graduating.Apply to the most prestigious programs you think you have a shot at. It is also wise to have a "fall-back school," which is well-ranked but more within reach. \n This professor will most likely direct both your program of study and dissertation. \n Introduce yourself and your ideas for the theoretical project you would like to work on with this faculty member. \n Explain about the work you've already done, including compositions from your master's program. This is a good chance to engage the faculty member on literary, rhetorical, and pedagogical (teaching) ideas and see if you can form a good professional relationship. \n The professor you pair up with finally is frequently referred to as your "major professor" for various purposes. Sometimes they will also be called your dissertation director when that time comes. \n On rare occasions, major professors will leave a department/university for one reason or another. It is possible to still work with them remotely if you can get permission from your department/program. Otherwise, you will have to find another professor in the department to take you on. \n If you've narrowed your prospective program choices down to just a handful, then physically going to them may help make your decision about where to spend the next few years it may take to get your degree.Schedule time to meet with the professor(s) you may work with. See if you can at least with your potential major advisor to go over likely dissertation subjects, courses, and program expectations. \n Take a walk around the department. Find out what the other English, Literature, and Creative Writing professors and grad students are studying. They may contribute to your work and vice-versa. \n Find out if there are any writing clubs, literary workshops, poetry reading groups, book clubs or similar organizations that work with the department or university that could be of use to your topic. Get their contact information at the very least.Ask to talk with current doctoral students in the program. Many graduate programs will organize informal lunches, dinners, or social times with current grad students so that you can ask questions about what their experience is like. These can be just as informative as speaking with the faculty, if not more so. Ask about the camaraderie of the department, work/life balance, and whether there are any "problem" faculty you should be aware of. \n You will need these for your applications to other graduate schools. These letters will, ideally, highlight your aptitude and work ethic, among other positive traits observed by those that know your work and character.Try to give your chosen writers at least a month's advance notice so they can take their time writing the letter. Consider providing your writers with a copy of your curriculum vitae (C.V.) to help remind them of your work. Be transparent and let them know exactly what the letter is for and the school you intend to apply for. They can tailor the letter better for your needs. \n Pick writers that know your work, such as teachers and employers. Make sure you seek letters that include some from your master's program faculty--especially your thesis advisor. Your program may have specific requirements about who writes the letters. \n Choose not to see the letters before they are sent. Sometimes you are given the option of viewing sealed or unsealed letters before they are sent to where you apply, and some schools will invalidate the letters if they are unsealed. Additionally, requesting to examine the letter may seem as though you do not trust the sender. If the faculty member seems hesitant to recommend you, it is better to find someone else than take a half-hearted letter. \n Confirm with the school if the letters need to be sent from the university, on university letterhead, submitted electronically, or should be sent with your application packet. \n If there is a physical mailing involved, provide the properly addressed envelope and postage to your writers. If there is an electronic submission involved, make sure all the web addresses are correct, and get confirmations. \n If it's approaching the deadline and your recommenders have not provided their letters, it's acceptable to give them a polite reminder about your request for a letter of recommendation. \n Your personal statement, sometimes called a statement of purpose, is a major component of your application. It introduces you to the admissions committee and makes your case as to why you want to pursue a doctorate in English/Literature. You should prepare to write several drafts of this important document and get feedback from mentors. The personal statement may be anywhere from 500 words to two pages.Discuss your academic background, research interests, and professional aspirations. If you have already conducted extensive research or have peer-reviewed publications, mention them here. Talk in detail about what you want to research and how the degree will further your career goals.Mention specific attractions about the program to which you’re applying. For example, do they have an extensive rare manuscripts library? Is there a faculty member you are keen to work with? You don’t need to “suck up” to the committee, but making informed statements about why you want to study at each particular program will help convince the committee that you have prepared for the work ahead.Avoid cliches. Do not talk about how you have always liked to read, or how you burn with a hard, gem-like flame for poetry. Do not use a dictionary definition or famous quote to open your essay. Convey that you are engaging with the field at a professional level. \n Show, don’t tell. Use specific examples whenever possible. For example, don’t say “I am passionate about literature.” Say “In my spare time I volunteer as a reading group coordinator for underprivileged schoolchildren because I want to share with them my passion for literature.”Try to keep your writing polished but approachable. You don’t want to come across as stuffy, but you also don’t want to come across as unsuited for the rigors of a Ph.D. program. \n You will need to submit a writing sample to your doctoral program. This sample displays your intellectual abilities, the quality and rigor of your work, and your promise as a scholar. Ask for help from a mentor or faculty member in choosing what essay you will use as your writing sample.You may be asked to prepare several writing samples, especially if you are applying to a doctoral program with a creative writing emphasis. Choose samples that reflect the variety of your work as well as the quality of it. \n Keep your sample to the length requested. If this means you have to cut chunks out of it, do so. Do not submit a sample significantly longer than requested. The committee may well simply stop reading it., You will likely need to submit your CV along with your other application materials. If you are applying to the Ph.D. directly from your undergraduate degree, you may need to include some accomplishments from your high school years. If you are applying from your master’s program, make sure that you don’t include too much early stuff -- this can make it appear as though you are padding your CV. However, unlike with a traditional resume, the lengthier your CV, the better, so do not leave off important information.Include the following sections:Heading. This includes your name, address, and contact information \n Education. This includes your degrees, beginning with those in progress or most recently earned. Include the name of the institution, city/state, degree type and major, and the month and year the degree was (or will be) awarded. If you graduated with honors, it is acceptable to mention it. If you are coming from a master’s program, state your thesis title and advisor’s name. \n Relevant Experience. List positions that reflect your experience and expertise. If you have prior teaching or tutoring experience, highlight this, as you will likely need to teach to support yourself in the doctoral program. Include your job title, organization name, city/state, and the dates you held each position. Include a brief summary of your responsibilities. Don’t include non-academic jobs here. \n Publications. If you have already published research or creative work, list it here. If you do not have publications, you can title this section “Research Experience” and discuss any major research projects you have conducted or assisted with. \n Professional Presentations. If you have attended conferences or other professional events, list them here. \n Honors and Awards. List any competitive scholarships or fellowships you have received. You may also list scholastic honors and other awards. \n Some will be printed, some will be online. Make sure you have mailing supplies (large yellow envelopes, postage stamps) if it's a print application. Make sure you have the correct browser software and settings according to the instructions if it's online. \n These can be large and detailed forms, so take your time. If it's a paper application, print a couple of copies in case you fill out something incorrectly and need to redo a page. Hold off stapling the pages until the end. \n For online applications, make sure you set aside plenty of time since they often are done in one sitting. Save your work frequently if possible. \n Use a large yellow envelope to mail your application materials to the university in the case of a print application. If you are unsure of the amount of postage you need, take the entire pack to your local post office and they will weigh it, let you know the postage amount, and mail it for you if request. \n Submit your application online if that is the method available. \n Ask friends to proofread your application as well. Print out your documents and read them in hard-copy. You are applying to the highest-level degree in your field, and the admissions committee will notice minor errors. Sloppy proofreading suggests a lack of commitment., You should consider applying to at least half a dozen schools, if not more. These departments can vary considerably in size and funding, so it's hard to predict how much competition you will be facing. \n Most programs will have fees associated with applying, so take that into consideration with the number of applications you submit. \n Be prepared that you may get staggered responses from your different applications. Some may accept, wait-list, or reject you earlier than others. \n If you are accepted or wait-listed fairly early, be alert to response deadlines since most programs are aware that students they accepted sometimes refuse admission. This may open up a position for a wait-listed student, but also may compel you to make a decision on one school that accepted you before others have responded. \n Make sure they arrived at your prospective doctoral program by its application deadline. \n Some schools will have this service for free, some will have you pay for it. But to be official, they must be submitted by your school to the destination. Some schools will ask for copies from you in the interim, but those will be unofficial. \n The names of the major field may differ from school to school, but some examples of major concentrations include: medieval, Renaissance, Restoration and 18th century (British/American), 19th century (British/American), criticism, theory, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, and rhetoric.Most universities require a major field to be taken along with several minor fields to improve a graduate's breadth of academic coverage. So you may focus on one area, but still take a few classes in others you weren't initially interested in. \n These will be professors that lead your minor fields and consult for your comprehensive exams in addition to your major advisor. They may or may not continue onto your dissertation committee. \n Take classes with at least some of your committee members if possible. It will help them learn your work, and facilitate collegiality (professional friendship). \n Some universities require an "out of area" member--a professor from another department to ensure your department is not giving students a free pass. Ask your major professor who they recommend, or if you have a professor in mind, run the choice by your advisor first. \n Occasionally committee members will retire, move, or for whatever reason leave the department. If this happens you can arrange with your department to conduct academic business with them remotely, or consult the procedures to replace them. \n These professionals are the source of information and guidance throughout your program. \n Check with your department's academic advisor especially for administrative information and deadlines. Also the advisor can help make sure you're on time with fulfilling the required credits for your major and minor fields. \n Meet with your major professor frequently for guidance on theoretical ideas, professional development, and to make sure you are meeting program requirements in conjunction with the academic advisor. \n Check your program rules for how many credits you need for each major and minor concentration. You might want to keep your own chart in addition to the department's records. \n See if some classes "double count" for major and minor fields, two minor fields, etc., with your advisor. This can free up room to take other classes you need or might be interested in. \n Do not be averse to taking classes out of your "comfort zone." This can lead to helpful collaborations with other colleagues, introduce rich ideas into your work, and provide breadth and depth to your professional applications later. \n In most doctorate of English/Literature programs, a minimum of 2 years or 30 credit hours of full-time coursework is required for the degree beyond the master's degree. But this can vary widely.Pick mostly classes that also help your dissertation along with the writing that you will complete for them. \n Most graduate programs fund their students through assistantships of some kind. Frequently, teaching assistants provide grading or some other form of assistance to professors and the department on a part-time basis during the semester. \n Take advantage of opportunities to instruct a class if you get them. This will be practice for a teaching position should you get one, and experience you can put on a job application later. Note that even if you are the instructor of record, meaning you are entirely in charge of teaching the class, you will likely still be called a “Teaching Assistant.” \n Most programs require students to pass a written and/or oral comprehensive exam to become a Ph.D. candidate, at which point all coursework is recognized as complete and only the dissertation remains for degree completion. \n Prepare for this test to cover the major and minor concentration fields. In some programs, you may get to choose which areas you take exams in. Other programs may have pre-established examination areas. \n Get questions or prepare with your committee members ahead of time. \n Expect the written essay parts to last several hours, whether in take-home form or on-site in a classroom/computer lab form. If you know graduate students that have taken exams from these professors before, you should consider asking them what to expect--but remember your experience could still be different, their experience should just be a guide. \n Oral exams typically involve the entire committee in the room together with you, asking you questions. This can be very intimidating, but typically you will not be allowed to enter comprehensive exams unless your major professor thinks you are ready. If at any point you are having serious questions, consult your major professor first. \n You should do this to plan your dissertation's development. Your status at this point frequently will be called "ABD" (all but dissertation). \n Discuss fellowship and grant funding opportunities for your dissertation work. \n Establish your dissertation committee, keeping in mind it may differ from your committee leading up to comprehensive exams. You should pick committee members that contribute to your work's theoretical framework, but also can help with the practical writing critique. \n Get an idea of time-frame for completion. This will likely change, but you should keep in mind your program's deadline to complete your degree requirements. Otherwise, you may need to retake your comprehensive exams or file an extension (to allow more time to complete the degree) with your university. \n Discuss other professional activities you might do while "ABD," including book reviews, conferences, teaching assistance, etc. \n Consult frequently with your major advisor about your work. Ideally, you can build off of ideas you generated earlier in your master's program and/or classes, but either way you will be doing a considerable amount of additional writing.Outline your rhetorical ideas, characterizations, plots, inspirations, philosophical arguments, methods, and keep a list of works you may cite. \n Plan a more detailed time frame for completing each step of your dissertation including time to travel if needed to gather resources, when you might complete chapters, and potential defense dates. \n Explain how your work fits in genre of literature you seek to enter. \n Outline the dissertation itself including chapters, subheadings, and a works cited section. This will organize your thoughts, and keep your workload manageable. \n Consider dropping in headings of works you have already done as potential chapter titles \n Having sections to work on will allow you to more easily budget your time to work on the dissertation. You can work on a section, take a break, move onto another, and repeat. \n Ensure an overall theme or current of thought is running through these sections you are setting up. If you set this up in your outline, it will focus your ability to maintain coherent thoughts in the body of the dissertation. \n There are numerous funding opportunities for humanities and graduate students. Consult with your program's and college's listings as well as any academic societies you may belong to. These can be competitive, so look for and apply to multiple sources.Find funding for the right stage of your work "pre-dissertation," while you're researching, and others while you're in the writing phase near completion.Ensure that your project falls within the grant/fellowship scope, and write any application letters to argue for such a case. \n Make a note of deadlines and notification time frames as they tend to move from semester to semester and year to year. \n Check to see if you can satisfy the grant/fellowship commitments beyond your own work. Some will ask you to conduct lectures, present your progress, travel, etc... \n Like the thesis, this will be mostly original work. Bring in the work you used for your master's degree if applicable. Look for contributions that will enrich your content. \n Ask experienced writers for help on other techniques, plot devices, and/or writing strategies that might help your work along. \n Present work you do at conferences to get early feedback before it’s in the final form. You may also get ideas on more concepts you had not considered. \n Keeping a steady writing schedule can be extremely difficult, especially as one is likely to have other distractions from life crop up by the time the dissertation writing phase arrives. \n Try to write just a little each day, maybe a couple of hours. If you can't, then maybe set aside blocks of time you know you won't be disturbed on specific days. \n Shop around parts of what you write to your major advisor or graduate students at the same level of progress as yourself. Putting together a group of students at the dissertation phase can be mutually motivating. \n Upon completion of the dissertation, each student meets with a dissertation committee--usually the major advisor, a few others from your department, and one "out of area" faculty member. If the committee approves the dissertation and defense, you will have completed the degree. \n Make sure you have consulted with your committee on a date and gotten a location for the defense. Frequently these defenses are budgeted to last two hours, but may be shorter. \n If one professor is abroad, see if teleconferencing them in is an option. \n Check with your college office/advisor to see if your dissertation has met all formatting requirements. \n 
 If for instance, you want to buy something online, or you want to join a newsgroup, it is better than you use a disposable email address. Yahoo! and Hotmail are some of the free accounts where you can make you own disposable email. Both of these are able to interface with other famous email clientele such as the outlook and the outlook express. You can use one of the two for your purchasing transactions.\n Perhaps if your birth date is April 17, 1968, do not make an account that contains both your name and birth date. Use “tough” passwords - Avoid using birth dates, anniversaries, or your children’s birth dates when making passwords. Do not use passwords that are purely letters or numbers. In addition, to not to use passwords consist true words. Make passwords made of phases like “I drink 1 glass of milk everyday”. Get the first letter of every word in the phrase and it will result to “id1gome”. \n If you think your passwords have been exposed, change them for your protection. \n This is to monitor the transactions made with each of your credit cards. Therefore, if your other credit cards have an online transactions you are certain that those are fake. Make use of a credit card rather than a debit card, though many debit cards have online purchase safety steps, it is easier to fight fake charges than to refund debit card finances already used. When you make online transactions ensure that it is safe \n If possible, click the logos to confirm that they are genuine. \n These are only fraudulent. Some people do them attempt and secure your personal data. Most of them increasingly improve their modus operandi and go to great lengths to appear genuine like the company websites using their own logos. \n 
\n \n If, for instance, you are making trail mix, you will include nutrition information from the original packaging of ingredients such as peanuts and raisins. \n The percentage information you use in your label will be based on a 2000 calories per day diet. \n \n \n The serving size will be based on the 2000 calories per day diet. \n The information following the serving size and amount of servings per container will be listed according to the amount per serving. \n \n Fat will have sub-categories of saturated fat and trans fat. \n If there is any fat listed, cholesterol content information must also be included. \n When you are including cholesterol information, the order should be Total Fat, then sub-sections Saturated Fat and then Trans Fat, followed by Cholesterol. \n Energy and nutrient information will be expressed as per 100 g/ml, per package if the package has only one serving, or per serving when there is more than a single serving per package. \n \n Carbohydrates will have sub-categories of dietary fiber and sugars. \n The order should be Carbohydrates with a sub-category of Dietary Fiber or Total Carbohydrates with sub-categories Dietary Fiber and Sugar. \n Your Daily Values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs." \n In the footnote section, also include the gram or milligram amounts for the fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates and dietary fiber based on a 2000 diet. \n \n Nutrition information should be in a tabular format, and must include a heading such as "Nutrition Label" or "Nutrition Facts." \n \n Label title should be in 13 pt. font, while nutrition information should be in 8 pt. font. \n Bold the font of your nutrition categories, including Total Fat, Cholesterol, Sodium, Total Carbohydrates and any others. \n
\n Then check other versions to see whether they will solve these issues. \n The extents are the name for the region of contiguous physical blocks, and is likely to be of benefit for those that store the large media, and the resulting reduction of file fragmentation. \n When you make use of ext2, ext3 but not ext4 - more of the data when you do the write cycle has been immediately put on the hard disk and is safe from the outage of power corruption. However - due to the implementation of persistent pre-allocation, the ext4 version may respond faster with the increased risk of loss of data, as write-back to the physical disk has a delay. \n Are you currently near, or in danger of a breach, of the 32,000 sub-directory limit? Then you may consider ext4 journal system, as it has the benefit of raising this limit by a factor of two. This is most unlikely for the regular user. \n Due to implementation of ext2 and ext3 system, there is a great limit on the ability to reduce the occurrence of fragmentation. Implementation of ext4 has work around for this, so if you suffer from the fragment than you can consider this the positive. \n Do you have a mission-critical system that relies on timestamp for some reason? The ext4 journal system has now a measurement of timestamp accurate to the nanosecond. \n

 You will be looking for different things depending on whether you are buying property as an investment that you will rent out, to use as a vacation home, or to live in permanently.Investment – Buying as an investment means you will be looking for properties that increase in value and which can provide rental income. Generally, this means you will be best off buying in vacation hot spots like the coasts and islands, or in big cities like Barcelona, Valencia, and Madrid. Although country homes have been rising in value of late, investing in the countryside can prove difficult because it can be hard to find people to manage your property. \n Vacation home – You will want a home that is easy to lock and leave. You don’t want to spend all year dealing with a home that you spend only a few weeks at. Apartments and villas in developments are generally the best option for this, as the grounds will be cared for and the presence of neighbors will help to keep your property safe. Buying in popular tourist areas will also make your property easier to rent if you want to earn income when you are not using it. \n Permanent home – You will want to look for a home and region that fits your budget and offers the quality of life you desire in terms of local infrastructure, facilities, and accessibility. So while you may long for a country home, it may not be reasonable if you also want to be near stores and other expats. You will also need to consider the local schools if you have children, and access (TGV and airports) if you wish to travel or entertain guests.\n Alongside price of the property, fees and taxes, there are annual taxes you will have to pay whether you move to Spain, rent your property, or use it as a vacation home. \n IBI (Impuesto Sobre Bienes Inmuebles) is a property ownership tax set locally that ranges from 0.4% to 1.1% of the valor catastral – the administrative value of the property, often lower than the market value. Owners might pay as little as 100 euros per year for a small country property, but a luxury home in an expensive development on the waterfront in Marbella might cost as much as 3,000 euros per year.Wealth Tax – Over a certain amount, the net worldwide assets of residents and the Spanish assets of non-residents are taxed. There is a 700,000 euro deduction per person (500,000 in Catalonia) and a 300,000 euro deduction for the property of residents. Tax is then calculated on assets above and beyond these deductions, with the rate ranging from .2% to 2.5%. For the rate table, see here. \n Personal Income Tax – Non-residents pay this tax based on the property they own in Spain. Those who don’t rent out their property and have no other Spanish income pay 25% of 2% of the valor catastral of the property. A property worth 500,000 euros, for instance, would pay 25% of 10,000 euros, or 2,500 euros. Non-residents who rent out their property must pay taxes on the income generated, generally 25% of the gross income earned in Spain., If you are a national from another EEC (European Economic Community) country, then you already have the right to move to and work in Spain. However, you will need to acquire a residency card if you are retiring to Spain, moving to Spain and not working, or are a non-EU dependant of an EU national.If you are from outside the EU, you will need to apply for a residence visa in order to immigrate to Spain, and a work permit if you want to work there. The most common types of visa are:Resident Visa to Retire in Spain – This visa allows you to live in Spain without working. You will need a valid current passport, proof of adequate financial resources to live in Spain without working, a medical certificate from your doctor verifying that you do not suffer from contagious diseases, drug addiction, or mental illness, and a fee of $38 to $160, depending on your nationality.Resident Visa to Work in Spain – To get a working visa, you will first need to be hired by a Spanish company. They will contact the Spanish Immigration Office to request a letter approving your work permit and residency visa. When applying for your visa, you will need this letter, a valid passport, a Police Records Certificate from the country you currently live in, a medical certificate, and a fee of $38 to $190, depending on your nationality.Residence Visa for Investors or Self-Employed – You can acquire this visa if your source of income will not involve being hired in Spain. In addition to the application forms, you will need a valid passport, a Police Records Certificate, a Medical Certificate, evidence of proper degree or academic title if necessary for your work, evidence that you are financially sound, and a work or investment project document showing the type of business you will conduct, projected gains, and positions to be created (if applicable), as well as a list of the authorizations and permits required to conduct your business., Buying a home in Spain is a major, and life-changing, experience. Think carefully before making any decision and ensure that your family is behind you. \n Once you know which area and property you’re interested in buying, be certain you have enough funds for the purchase. Don’t forget to consider such aspects as the cost of moving your possessions to Spain. \n Don’t be rushed into making a decision, and don’t let yourself be pressured. Certainly don’t sign anything until you’re ready. \n Pensioners should make certain that they can have their pensions paid into a Spanish bank. It’s most important that your have health insurance in place and that you make a will. Resident non-citizens may also purchase Spanish health insurance (cost depends on income) by visiting a social security office in Spain. \n Sometimes circumstances change, and you might find you want to return to your home country. Before committing yourself to purchasing a home in Spain, make sure you have sufficient funds to make the move back home. \n The region that is right for you is a subjective decision. You may be looking for the sun, sand, and expat community of the southeast coast, or prefer a quiet rural area. Be sure to research the regions carefully, and then visit the areas you think sound promising before you start searching for property in earnest. \n The regions of Catalona, Valencia, and Murcia contain a long stretch of coast that has been called Spain’s California because of its mild climate and beautiful beaches. \n Catalonia – Prices Medium to High – This region includes Barcelona and the Costa Brava – the coast north of the city where the Pyrenees run down to the sea – and the Costa Dorada, the flatter coast south of Barcelona. The area is well-developed and efficiently run, with beautiful beaches and an attractive countryside of farms, orchards, and vineyards. The winters are mild.Valencia – Prices Low (south coast) to Hight (north coast) – The Mediterranean coast south of Catalonia features a mild year-round climate, beautiful beaches, and a large expat community, particularly along the Costa Blanca, which runs from Denia to Pilar de la Horadada, south of Alicante. Its popularity with expats from across Northern Europe makes the Costa Blanca a cosmopolitan and varied place to live. However it also means higher taxes on new properties.Murcia – Prices Low – This area includes the Costa Calida, which lies south of the Costa Blanca. The climate is very dry, and the region is not highly developed. However, both the cost of purchasing property and the cost of living are very low, making this an attractive retirement location., Andalusia is extremely varied, with three stretches of coast that each have markedly different characters, and a variety of famous cities such as Seville, Cadiz, and Granada. \n Andalusia – Prices Medium to High – Andalusia is home to the Costa de la Luz, Costa de Almeria, and the Costa del Sol. This last stretch of coast is hugely popular among British expats due to its warm climate. The Costa de la Luz is both cooler and much less developed., The pricey Balearics off the coast of Spain and the more low-key Canaries off of Morocco's southern coast are perhaps more different than they are alike, though these island destinations share the distinction of being popular vacation and retirement destinations for Spaniards and foreigners alike. \n Balearics – Price High – Though expensive, these islands feature temperate, but seasonal weather, beautiful scenery, and high-quality housing stock. The largest, Mallorca, features great marinas, an opera house, and an international crowd. Menorca has a drier climate, with a cooling breeze that takes the edge off the baking heat of the summer. Ibiza has a reputation as a party destination for tourists, which means it is a good place to buy a property to rent out. Formentera is the smallest island with a mixture of attractive new developments and mellow old farmhouses. \n Canaries – Price Medium – Though a bit isolated and far distant from the rest of Spain, the Canary islands have the warmest summer climate in Spain, a varied topography including mountains and sandy beaches, a large international community, and lower taxes when purchasing property., The northern interior of Spain tends to be hotter and drier, while the northwest coast is cooler and wilder. As a result, both offer good value, particularly Galicia. \n Galicia – Price Low – Though the weather is cooler and the winters less mild than the more famous southeast, the northwest Atlantic coast has grown more popular recently due to lower costs, fewer expats, and a more rural feel., Homes in Barcelona retained their value better than the coasts in the recent downturn, while the property markets in Madrid and Valencia have recently begun to recover, making them good sites for investment.A variety of other cities like Segovia, Granada, Cordoba, Ovieda, Sevilla, and Vigo offer beautiful architecture and a high quality of life.Four cities, however, stand out as popular places to buy: \n Barcelona – Price High – The Telegraph recently listed Barcelona as one of the top 20 places in the world to invest in propertyThe second largest city in Spain and its cultural capital, it boasts a beautiful old town, a mild Mediterranean climate, and access to nearby beaches.Madrid – Price High – The capital of Spain and the third largest city in Europe, Madrid is rich with history and things to do, though it does get rather hot during the summer. \n Valencia – Price Medium – Known as the “California of Europe,” Valencia has mild temperatures, great cuisine, a rich history and beautiful architecture. It also offers easy access to beautiful beaches.Malaga – Price Low – At the heart of the Costa del Sol, Malaga offers a charming old town center, low prices,and has recently been rated the best Spanish city to live in., The best way to narrow down where you might want to live is by researching various areas exhaustively. Use the internet, magazines and books related to purchasing homes in Spain.Be sure to research: \n The property market in the area. If you are buying as an investment, you will want to avoid areas with declining values. \n The nature of daily life in the area. \n The downsides and risks in that area. Is it isolated? Are taxes relatively high compared to other areas? Is it developed enough for your tastes? \n Lawyers and agents who you might work with during your purchase. \n The ideal way to do this is to rent for a few months in the area you are considering. If that is not possible, even a week dedicated to exploring the region and talking to ex-pats about their experience can be hugely helpful. Be sure to treat this as a fact-finding mission, not a vacation. Your goal is to get a feel for daily life and to meet the people who you will work with in buying property., Get your finances in order and investigate a mortgage. You will need to do this in advance so that you can move quickly when you find the property you want. There are three options: remortgaging your current home (i.e. taking a home equity loan), borrowing from a bank in your current country, or arranging a mortgage on your Spanish property through a Spanish lender. Bear in mind that an overseas mortgage may incur higher set-up costs (sometimes 3 to 4 per cent of the amount borrowed) and that Spanish lenders will not be interested in doing business if existing loans exceed 35 per cent of the borrower’s income, as is the case in much of Western Europe. \n Remortgaging – This is typically the cheapest and easiest solution. Releasing equity in your current home means that the second home can be purchased for cash, without the need for another mortgage. However, this is only feasible for those who own their first home outright. Also, you may lose your home if you cannot make your payments.Loan in your country – Most banks that lend for purchasing in Spain will have offices there, meaning you are technically borrowing in Spain. However, it can be easier to work with a local bank. You will also need to consider the type of currency you take the loan in. If you will be living off of income in your home country, then it is a good idea to take the loan in that currency to avoid exchange-rate fluctuations that might increase your repayments. If you will be generating income in Spain – buy renting your property, for instance – then consider taking out the loan in euros.Loan in Spain – Taking out a mortgage in Spain can simplify repayments, save you on the bank commissions charge for international transactions, and allow you to take advantage of low interest rates.However, a Spanish mortgage will increase initial costs, since the stamp tax you pay upon purchasing a new home will be based not on the loan amount, but on the value of the mortgage including interests and costs. This will increase the stamp tax from .5% to 1% to somewhere between 1.5% and 2%., When evaluating properties, you should budget 15% on top of the agreed purchase price to cover the various fees and taxes that must be paid.Legal fees – Many lawyers charge 1% of purchase price or more. It is generally more cost-effective to hire a lawyer by the hour. A typical transaction should cost 1,000 to 2,500 euros.IVA (Spain’s equivalent of VAT) – This tax is 10% for residential properties that have never before been occupied, plus 1% stamp duty. The stamp duty is 1.5% in Valencia and 2% in Murcia.In the Canaries, the IVA is 4.5%ITP (Impuesto sovre Transmisiones Patrimoniales) – This transfer tax is due on re-sale property. It is generally 7%, but may be as high as 10%, depending on the region where you are buying and the price. For the ITP for various regions, see here. \n Notary and property registration fees – These range from .5% to 1%.Land registry costs - The cost to register is usually around 1%. \n There are a variety of different types of home available in Spain, from small apartments to large villas. What you are looking for will depend on your budget and how you intend to use the property.Villa (vivienda unifamiliar) – These are relatively large detached properties with a home and grounds. They are great permanent homes, but function less well as vacation homes, since the grounds entail a good deal of maintenance year-round and their value results in higher taxes. \n Apartment (apartamento) – Apartments are the most widely available type of property in Spain. They are ideal vacation properties, as they are easier and cheaper to manage. It is also easier to find apartments close to town centers. \n Modern semidetached (casa adosada) – These properties are most often built as parts of large new developments, and typically feature two stories and a small private garden. They are good both as permanent homes and vacation homes, offering the privacy and space of a villa with the relatively low upkeep of an apartment. They are still rare outside of highly developed areas. \n Village house (casa de pueblo) – These village homes are typically semi-detached townhouses. They offer a lower price, village ambiance and shops and stores in walking distance. However, they usually also need a good deal of work, particularly on the kitchen and bathrooms. For those looking for vacation homes, they are also less than ideal as it can be difficult to find property management companies in smaller villages. \n Country house or farm house (cortijo / masia / casas rural / finca) – These properties are less expensive than coastal properties. They offer good value and idyllic surroundings. However, particularly for those who are not fluent in Spanish, they can also be isolating. They are not ideal as vacation homes or rental properties, as upkeep and management at a distance is challenging. \n There are different rules and taxes in Spain depending on whether you are buying off-plan property, new construction, or resale property. \n Resale property – These properties are generally safer investments, as you don’t have to worry about whether or not they will be completed. Taxes upon purchase are also generally lower. However, you should be prepared to spend money on repairs and updates, particularly in the kitchen and bathrooms.New construction (obra nueva) – This is the most expensive type of property, although recently rampant construction in Spain has led to a market with too many homes and not enough buyers, bringing down the price. The biggest advantages are that unlike with off-plan properties, you know exactly what you are getting, and unlike with resale properties, you won’t have to do any remodeling.Off-plan (sobre plano) property – This is property for which the plans have been finalized and approved by local authorities, but for which construction has not yet finished. The benefit is that compared to completed new properties, you should get a discount of 10% to 20% off the current market price. On the other hand, you will have to rely on plans and your imagination; you won’t see the actual property you have purchased until it is finished. And, you will have to wait a year and a half or more to move in, if everything runs smoothly. It is imperative that you choose an established, reliable developer to ensure timely, quality construction, and that you do a thorough inspection to locate construction problems before completing the sale., Many who buy their property as a vacation home plan to rent it out for short blocks of time (three months or less) to vacationers in order to make income when they are not there. However, this is not always legal in Spain. In many areas, there are limits on renting property short-term, as well as on marketing private property to tourists. If you fail to comply with local rules, fines can be as high as 30,000 euros.Before you buy, seek independent legal advice, speak with a property management company, or check the rules for short-term rental at your local town hall to make sure it is permitted. \n Agents can not only find you the right property, but also guide you through the legal process of purchasing it. Remember, though: estate agents in Spain are paid by the seller, so they do not always have the buyer’s interest in heart. The best way to select an agent is through the recommendations of friends and acquaintances, followed by an interview to ensure you are comfortable working together. There are several types of broker you can choose between:Corredores – These are local brokers in rural Spain who know when people want to sell and who charge very small commissions – about 1% to the buyer and seller each. Few speak Spanish or have offices, but if you are fluent, it is worth spending time in an area to seek out the local corredor. \n Buyer’s Agents – These agents are paid an upfront fee to search for properties on behalf of clients, but unlike search and find companies, they receive no commission from estate agents, meaning they are free to show properties from private sellers. They will visit and inspect potential properties, as well as walk client’s through the purchase process. They usually charge a successful search fee of about 2.5% of the sale price. \n Foreign-Based Agents offering Spanish Property – Look for offices that have opened their own branch in Spain. They will know much more about the local market than those who simply pass clients on to agents in Spain in return for part of the commission. \n Foreign-Owned Estate Agents – Because there are no qualifications to become an estate agent in Spain, the numbers of agents catering to foreigners – the English in particular – has exploded in recent years. There are of course good agents, but be forewarned that in many areas, they charge excessive commissions (7.5% and up) and use pressure-sales techniques. \n There are several types of broker that you should avoid, as they add negligible value while inflating the commission you must pay.Online Property Companies – Most of these companies do not have offices in Spain or their own listings. Instead, they are marketing companies that list agent’s properties in return for a cut of the commission. As a result, they often charge inflated fees. Also, many listing are out of date. Other attractive properties are not actually for sale; they are listed only so the agent can acquire interested parties’ contact info. \n Introducers – These are people – generally expats – who befriend local visitors and offer to introduce them to trustworthy estate agents, in return for part of the agent’s commission. Be warned: they are most likely to introduce you to aggressive agents seeking high commissions. \n Search and Find Companies – These companies do not list their own properties. Instead, they will search for properties that meet a client’s specifications, drawing up lists of properties to be examined. They work by splitting the commission with local real estate agents, which often leads to inflated fees. \n Multi-Listing Networks – Foreign agents and Spanish agents alike often participate in networks whereby they can show clients one another’s listings. When shown a listing, always clarify if it is from another agent, and if so, whether the commission will be split or simply increased, as is often the case. \n It is best to hire a lawyer before you set out to inspect possible purchases. Otherwise, you may find yourself pressed for time and be unable to properly interview and research the lawyer you choose.You will want a lawyer who is fluent in English and Spanish, and who specializes in Spanish land law (urbanismo). They can help guide you through the purchase process and inform you of the tax implications.If choosing a lawyer in your home country, be sure that they have experience working in Spain. \n If you choose a lawyer based in Spain, as for their registration number, which you can use to see if they are registered with the local bar association (Colegio de Abogados). \n You will want to visit the property to ensure that you like both the home and the area where it is located. If it is an existing structure, consider hiring a property inspector to walk through the building with you. Take careful note of any repairs or remodeling you will need to do. If you are purchasing off-plan, be sure to carefully consider the plans and completion schedule and to talk with both the developer and locals to ensure that you are working with a reliable company. \n To buy in Spain, you will need insurance, a fiscal number, euros, and a Spanish bank account. It is best to set these things up in advance in order to save money. \n Fiscal number (numero de identificacion de extranjeros) – This is your identification number for tax purposes in Spain. It can be obtained by you or an agent in Spain and takes 2 to 6 weeks to acquire.Foreign Exchange Account – If your funds are in a currency other than euros, you will need to purchase euros. Using a currency broker is by far the cheapest way to do so, and may save you thousands. Contact one ahead of time to ensure you get the best rate on your transaction.Insurance – If you use a Spanish mortgage, the lender will help to arrange insurance. Otherwise, you will need to purchase your own insurance through a Spanish company. \n Bank account – Most sellers will only accept checks drawn on Spanish banks, so you will need a local account. If you have taken out a Spanish mortgage, it is easiest to open an account at the bank that lent you the money. Otherwise, be careful to discuss transaction fees for international transfers before opening an account., If you are not fluent in Spanish, you should be sure that you have all contracts and legal documents translated into English by an independent translator. You want to be 100% certain that you understand the full content of what you are signing.You can find a list of accredited translators on the website of the Spanish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. \n Work with your lawyer to lower the price as much as possible, regardless of the type of construction you are purchasing. \n Off-plan property – You will want to negotiate any input you will have into the style of construction, as well as a clause stipulating that you can withhold 5% of the price at the signing of the deeds, to be paid after the developer has fixed any problems you identify in the construction. \n Re-sale property – Negotiate the price, the undeclared value (the amount of the price to be paid under the table and not declared in the deed – try to avoid paying it if possible and never go over 10%), deadlines, who pays the plusvalia (a municipal tax on the increase in land value, usually paid by the seller), any extra fixtures included in the price, access to the property before closing (so that your architect can start estimating the cost of remodeling), and the deposit method (it is best to pay to a third party, preferably a lawyer, who will hold the funds in escrow until the sale is complete).New property – Negotiate the price, undeclared value, deadlines, the pusvalia, and the deposit method. \n This is the point of no return, after which there will be serious financial implications to backing out. Do not rush into it. Before signing anything, be sure you have had your lawyer look over it. Don’t allow developers or real estate agents to pressure you into signing without due diligence. The UK government offers a helpful checklist of things to consider before signing. \n It is recommended to visit the property you plant to purchase and to sign all the necessary contracts in person at the notary’s office, but this is not always possible. The easiest alternative is to have someone represent you as a ‘verbal representative’ (representante verbal). Soon after the purchase, you will need to ratify the representation at a Spanish Consulate in your own country or at the Spanish notary’s office when next you visit Spain. Completing a power of attorney is also possible, though not recommended.Off-plan property – Don’t sign a reservation contract (which take the property off the market for 30 days) in return for a fee (usually 6,000 euros) unless it has a clause stating that the deposit will be returned if you do not proceed. The point of no return is the payment construction contract (contrato de compraventa de vivienda en construccion). Be sure to have your lawyer do due diligence before signing. This contract is accompanied by a first payment of around 25% of the price, plus IVA. The remaining payments will be made in stages or all at once when you sign the deed, depending on how you negotiate the contract.Resale or new property - Your lawyer should perform due diligence before you sign a private contract with the seller and pay the initial deposit (generally 10%). Afterwards, you will have 1 to 3 months to get your funds in place. You will then transfer the remaining funds, sign the deeds before a notary, and take possession of the property. Finally, you will register your title and pay any relevant taxes., Congratulations! Now that you have the keys to your new Spanish property, you can start the process of remodeling it and furnishing it, whether for your own purposes or to serve as a rental property. \n 
 On the other hand, if she starts the conversation too often, she might not be interested, either. When a girl likes a guy, she will likely try to show her interest without being too obvious or looking too needy. As a result, she will start at least half of your conversations if not most, but probably won't start all of them. If a girl does start all of them, it could be a sign that she is not worried about seeming needy because she only sees you as a friend.\n Even if the girl is tempted to hang on your every word, most girls will resist the urge. If anything, a girl who likes you is more likely to end a text conversation first in an effort to show that she is interesting and has an engaging social life even without you. When a girl ends most texting conversations with something like, "Gotta go, I'm heading to movie with my bff," she could be interested. If, however, she just stops texting instead of saying good-bye, she is probably not interested. \n A formal count is not necessary, of course, but make a mental note of how often she uses emoticons and which ones she uses most. The most often used emoticon a girl will flirt with is the winking face. The more often she uses an emoticon wink, the more likely it is that she has a thing for you. Standard smiles may or may not mean the same thing, but large smiles are another good sign. A blushing emoticon and a "kiss face" emoticon may also frequent her texts if she likes you \n If she quickly turns the conversation to herself, she might not be interested. Similarly, if she gives super quick answers like "K" or frequently leaves the conversation with little more than a "brb," she probably is not very interested. If she regularly jokes back with you when you say something funny, though, or asks you questions to keep the conversation, it demonstrates that she wants to keep talking to you for as long as possible. \n If most of her texts are practical, such as question about assignments, then she may not be interested. On the other hand, if her texts are personal and ask about your personal life, she might be interested. This is especially true if she recalls specific details you previously mentioned to her about your plans. Another promising type of text is the random question. Look for something of no significance, like, "Would you rather live on nothing but your least favorite food for a year or give up your favorite food for the rest of your life?" These questions are fairly unimportant, and if she asks a bunch of them, it could be a sign that she is looking for an excuse to talk to you because you are on her mind. \n Specifically, look at how often she uses exclamation points. More exclamation points indicates more excitement at the opportunity to talk to you, which could signify that she likes you. A "Hey you!" is infinitely more promising than a simple, "Hey." \n Not every girl does it, but many girls add extra vowels and consonants onto words. For instance, she might text words like "heyyyy," "riiiiiight," "pleeeeeaaassseee," "hiiiiii" or "byyyyeee." The idea is to mimic the elongation of words often used in real-life flirtatious banter. \n Any text laughter is a good sign, but there are some that are better signs than others. Standard abbreviations like "LOL," "ROTFL," or "LMAO" can be sent to just about anyone, friend or crush alike. A "haha" is a better sign, because she wants you to actually imagine her laughing. A "hehe" or "teehee" is even better. These two forms of text laughing are the equivalent of a real-life giggle, rather than a loud laugh, and a girl is more likely to text you a "giggle" if she wants to sound cute. \n A common hint dropped via text is the invitation to meet in person. An actual invite to a party is good, but an even better invitation is the random “on the fly” sort, in which she casually mentions something like, “I think I’ll head to the pool. Meet me there?” These messages may seem casual, but in actuality, they usually indicate that she wants to see you and only you, and now. A strong desire to see you is a pretty good hint that she is interested. \n 
 You don't have to have a monstrous kit with a gong like Neil Peart from Rush to get started drumming. You don't even have to have a kit at all. To get started on the basics, use your hands and tops of your thighs in a seated position to learn basic drum-kit rhythms. Listen to music with obvious rhythms and try to mock the rhythm with your hands. \n Many beginners can get frustrated upon plopping down behind a kit and not being able to play a simple rhythm yet. It's a good idea to start getting some sense of rhythm before dropping the cash on a big drum kit to practice on, or before giving yourself an opportunity to get frustrated.\n There are many ways to break down a a musical bar, but for the purposes of getting started, we'll discuss 4/4 time signature, meaning that there are 4 beats in a measure. Tap out 4 equal beats with one hand. These are quarter notes. \n Count out loud when you're just getting started. It's important to keep track of the rhythm and learn what you're playing, allowing you to develop more complex awareness of beat. \n It's a good idea to use a metronome or a click track to practice rhythms. They're easy to find online, in GarageBand, or on your phone, or by playing along to songs. \n Each quarter note is made up of two eighth notes. Keep tapping that simple quarter note beat with one hand and then try eighth notes at the same beat. These are counted "1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and..." Try your best to say it steadily and beat it with your hand. \n Continue with your first hand, counting out eighth notes. Now, whenever you say "Two" and "Four," tap the table or the top of your thigh with your other hand. This fills in where you'll be hitting the snare when you sit behind a kit. \n Continue tapping with both hands, but now whenever you say "One" or "Three", tap your right (or left) foot. This is called the downbeat, and is what you'll tap out on the bass drum. \n You're playing a simple rock-style drum beat! Learning drums is broken into two big categories of things you need to learn: rhythm and technique. You can't learn technique without a drum kit, but you can learn about rhythm. By learning everything you can about rhythms and developing your sense of keeping a beat and counting before you ever sit behind a drum kit, you'll be a better drummer and be able to learn more quickly. \n Each kit is different, using different kinds of drums that make up a set. There are different brands, sizes, sticks used, and different tunings among other slighter modifications that will affect the overall sound of each instrument. Still, many drum kits employ basically the same fundamental pieces. Most basic kits include: \n A bass drum, which makes the low-pitched booming sound when struck by a weighted mallet operated by a foot pedal. \n A snare drum, usually located to the non-dominant side of the drummer and played with the drummer's non-dominant stick. The snare is a tight, bright drum with a band of rattling metal beads under the drum head. Typically, the snare is known for its crisp "click" sound followed by the "resonating shuffle" of the beads. \n There are many types of tom-tom drums, but the most common three are the Floor Tom (the deepest of the three), the Mid-Tom (the medium of the three), and the High-Tom (the most high-pitched of the three). A very basic kit may only have the floor tom, while others may have many. They're tuned differently to create an array of different deeper noises for fills. \n There are many different kinds of cymbals, varying in type, shape, and sound. A cymbal is a round, metal object that resonates when struck. The four most commonly used types of cymbals are the hi-hat, the ride, the splash, and the crash. \n The hi-hat is a pair of cymbals mounted on a foot pedal. The foot pedal is usually played by the left foot and controls the cymbals, bringing them together when pressed and bringing them apart when released. You can strike the cymbal when it is apart or closed, and you can shut the cymbals with your feet at different rates of speed, each creating a different sound. \n The ride cymbal creates a more subtle and deeper sound than the other cymbals because it is used to play very repetitively throughout most music. The cymbal will usually resonate from one strike to another, featuring a very long reverberating "finish" to the sound. \n The splash is a cymbal that creates a metallic "splashing" sound, similar to the sound a water splash makes. It dies quickly after peaking and is typically used in basic fills to ornament your beat. \n The crash is similar to the splash, but usually generates a loud and long, sustained sound. Listen for the crash at the end of measures in pop music or especially in periods of heightened drama in orchestral music. \n There are two main ways to hold drum sticks, called the matched grip and the traditional grip. \n In the matched grip, you hold the sticks between your thumb and index finger a few inches from the bottom of the sticks. Wrap your remaining fingers around the sticks. Be sure the back side of your hands are facing up rather than facing to the side. This method is the most common way of holding sticks, allowing you plenty of wrist control and comfort. \n In the traditional grip, you'll hold the stick in your non-dominant hand by resting the stick in the cradle between your thumb and index finger and on top of your ring finger. Wrap your thumb, index and middle fingers around the stick. Hold the other stick using a matched grip. Some jazz drummers use a traditional grip to offer a different kind of control on the snare drum, playing intricate rhythms on it as part of fills. \n If you are interested in drumming, price many different new and used options before you spend the money on a set. Talk to the people at the stores and they should steer you in the right direction. Start out with a cheap, new set or a used set until you finally decide if you are going to stick with it. \n You can also consider joining your school band to have access to the equipment and lessons to help you learn. You might even ask in your band department if you'd be allowed to practice a few times on a kit because you're interested in the drums. The music folk are generally friendly people, and it can't hurt to ask. \n There are a lot out there, but there is no right or wrong stick. 5A is a good stick weight for beginners. \n Have your drum teacher or the people at the store give you some pointers on how to hold the sticks, how to hit the drum properly, how to adjust the drums to fit your stature, and how to set up your kit at home. You can also find a lot of this information for free on the internet. \n Good posture will make you more comfortable during practice and help you reach the drums more easily. You'll sound better and enjoy playing more by improving your posture. \n Sit up straight and keep your elbows in. Stay in tight to the kit, keeping the floor pedals at a comfortable distance from you. \n This can't be stressed enough: you need to learn to play a steady, even tempo and the easiest way to beat that into your brain is by practicing with a metronome. If you can't afford a metronome, you can find a click track somewhere which is a recorded metronome that you can play in your stereo, on your Walkman, or on your computer while you practice. \n Play the 8th notes on the hi-hat, hitting the snare drum on 2 and 4, and pressing the bass drum pedal with your foot on the 1 and 3. \n Make sure you count out loud when you are playing. Eventually you won't have to, but do it while you are learning and when you are practicing. \n To mix it up and get familiar with the kit, hit something else on the "Two" and on the "Four" instead of the snare drum, hit everywhere else. \n Try to develop a groove and get used to playing evenly, while counting out loud and while playing with the click. \n Learn how to close the hi-hat with the left foot when you strike it with your hands. It makes a different, shorter sound. This is the position at which most drummers use the hi-hat most frequently. \n Play straight eighth notes with the right hand. Use the left hand and hit the snare on "Two" and "Four". Lift your foot off of the hi-hat here and there to get used to the sounds you are making. You can open it all the way, open it a little and hit the hi-hat in different places such as the outside rim, or the bell at the top to get different sounds. \n At the same time you hit the hi-hat, learn to work in bass drum rhythms to help develop the muscles. \n Try to play with the right hand and foot at the same time, left hand free styling, or with all limbs at the same time to really get your muscles used to moving. \n Play the same thing above, but instead of hitting the snare on the "Two" and "Four" hit the hi-hat. When you are lifting your right hand off the hi-hat move your left hand down to hit the snare. Now you are basically playing the snare drum in between each hit of the hi-hat. \n While you are doing this count out loud "One e and a Two e and a Three e and a Four e and a" continuing to hit the hi-hat with the right hand on the "One and Two and Three and Four and" but hitting the snare on the "es and as." \n If you notice any tension, or you're struggling to keep up with the beats at the RPM you've set the metronome at, slow down the metronome until you feel relaxed. \n The basic "single" stroke and a "double" stroke are absolutely essential to developing your limb independence and drum complexity. If you strike the drum with one beat from each alternating hand, you have a single stroke pattern. However, if you strike the drum with one downward movement from each alternating hand and let the stick bounce on each alternating stroke to get two hits per stroke, you have a double stroke pattern. \n This is what enables a drummer to perform very fast rolls and patterns. By studying and practicing the 26 American drum rudiments, you will be well on your way to mastering single, double, triple and quadruple stroke patterns. \n It can be a bit like rubbing your belly and patting your head, but learning drums means that you've eventually got to do more complicated things all at once. Instead of making one movement up and one movement down you may have to double or triple or even quadruple one movement with a limb while the other limbs do something else in another direction. \n Count the same beat you've been using so far with eighth notes, and on every beat close the hi-hat with your left foot and open it on the offbeats, or "ands". Hit the snare drum on the twos and fours to make a basic rock beat. With your right hand keep 8th note time (one and two and three and four and) on the rim of the snare or on a ride cymbal if you have one. \n Experiment with various beats with the right foot while keeping the rest of the limbs locked in the main pattern. This is where it starts to get tricky. Don't worry though, it gets easier the more you play. You have to get your limbs used to making movements that are independent of each other. There is no quick way to do this. Just take your time and think about what you are doing. If you break it down into one beat at a time it makes things a lot easier. \n For quarter note triplets you must think in terms of half notes. Count 1-la-le evenly in the space of the half note. For eighth note triplets it's the same, but with three notes split in the space of a quarter note. \n Triplets are not used that much in rock beats but you will find them in drum fills and used in percussion lines found in school bands. Basically a triplet is where you play 3 notes in the time you usually play 2. you can have quarter note triplets, 8th note triplets, 16th note triplets, 32nd note triplets. \n We have a cool sounding beat with 8th note triplets. They are counted "" or any three syllable word. Play this along with the metronome each click on the metronome is a beat and each beat is subdivided. \n 16th notes are basically what you played earlier when you were learning to move your hands in opposite directions. These are counted "" \n 16th note triplets are counted , 32nd notes should be counted "[4 e + a + e + a} \n There are 32nd note triplets that require a lot of subdivision to count and are pretty much too fast to say out loud, but if you want to hear some 32nd notes and 32nd not triplets, then listen to the song "Hey Joe" by Jimi Hendrix. These notes are hard to play correctly because you need to be able to play them evenly, making the same sound on the drums with each hand and be able to move around the drum kit playing these notes in time with the rest of the song. \n Each click will be quarter beat and easy to keep time by the time you get to the higher subdivisions you will be counting faster or playing faster but the numbers you say will always land on the clicks of the metronome. \n Listen to some of your favorite songs and use a small subdivision such as the 8th or 16th note count and you will see that during a lot of the fills you will hear spaces where there is silence when you are counting. These are the rests. \n When you play an accented note with the right hand it should sound the same when you play with the left and when you make a normal stroke with the right it will sound the same as the left and vice versa and so on. \n An accented stroke is when you strike the drum harder than the other strokes (usually on the rim of the drum, also known as a rimshot). Accents give a very dynamic effect to the music. In music notation, accents are shown by the mathematical "greater than" sign (>). \n The purpose of a drum fill is to add a little flair to a song. A guitar player plays a hot little lick and a singer might shout and dance about, and the drummer plays fills. These happen in time between the beats, usually on the toms and the cymbals. Listen to John Bonham to hear the master of drum fills. \n Play "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +" and play as you did before with right hand on the hi-hat and left on the snare. Use the right foot on the kick. Repeat as you warm up. Now continue counting out loud and just play "1 + 2 +" and then stop playing with your limbs and just finish counting out loud "3 + 4 +"repeat. \n It should sound like "Boom tic Pap tic" now on the "3 + 4 +" do anything else for example start with moving every limb at the same time on the "3 + 4 +" you can hit the crash (if you have one) on the one on the following bar and you will have pulled off your first fill. \n Do every combination and variation on this basic theme, while counting the "3 + 4 +". Some will sound good to you some won't. Some basic ones can be all snare alternating hands. Two kick and then two snares. Two snares and two kicks. As long as you keep the time it doesn't matter what you pick as long as the time stays even. \n Continue to play the "1 + 2 +" as you did above. Now pick a couple subdivisions of the beat as written out between the brackets above for the "3" beat and the "4" beat" such as "[4 e + a} play note while counting out loud and use all limbs at the same time as you did above. \n Now pick other subdivisions for the "3" and 4" beat you can go "" or "" or "" or whatever. Is it starting to get easier yet? As long as the notes are played evenly and within the time you have lots and lots of possible combinations for the fills. \n You don't have to just play the beat and beat as fills. You can play the whole bar as a fill picking any of the subdivisions for each beat and combining them such as "" or whatever you picked. Say the subdivisions out loud then play with all limbs and then play around with using different sounds and sound combinations for the subdivisions. \n Learn to hold back on fills, even if you're a killer drummer. AC/DC songs feature extremely simple fills or no fills at all, which fits in perfectly with their no-frills reputation as a band. It would sound ridiculous if "Back in Black" featured a drum solo. \n You don't have to start a fill at the beginning of a beat. Count " One and Two" and play it like you did before with the right hand on the hi-hat and the left on the snare but when you get to the "and three and four and" play the fill starting on that and instead of waiting for the "three" beat. \n 
  Hold the paper in landscape orientation and in pencil, draw a line 2 1/2 inches from the bottom. \n  Draw growth lines radiating from the stem like large crescent shaped lines.  As in nature, perfect lines and spaces aren't required. \n  This will be the cat's head.  Add ears, a face, tail.  Embellish the cat further with whiskers, eyebrow whiskers, and a bow tie. \n  Use a box for a template and draw two rectangles in pencil by going around the box. \n  Divide up the windows with a large cross to create four panes. \n  Add mice, if desired.,  All types of watercolor work, but you will need to make up puddles for the wall and shelf, so use tube paints in yellow ochre and brown for those areas. \n  Paint fast and loose, avoiding having the color appear dry.  While damp, draw darker growth lines starting at the stem and continuing to the pumpkin's base. \n  Cover the entire cat with a loose wash. \n  Do the bow tie in green.  Do features in dark brown.  Do stripes on the cat., Do around the windows, or the wall, with diluted brown.,  Do them with a fully loaded brush in one stroke, replenishing with paint as needed.  Do the small moldings holding the glass panes with a smaller flat brush.  Turn your paper as you work. \n  When the moldings are completely dry, wet one pane with water, allowing it to soak in for a minute.  Fill a pointed brush with pale blue and barely touch it to a corner or side of the wet glass pane.  Let the water carry the pale blue over the entire pane, helping it along as needed with the point of your brush.  Repeat on all eight panes.  Allow to dry thoroughly.,  Paint the fruit on the sills, add texture to the walls, moldings and shelf, if desired.  Do this with a brush filled with paint and a light, glancing touch.,  Mixing the residue from the center of your palette often gives a nice neutral shade of gray.  If not, use just a touch of black diluted with water.  Make sure the piece is really dry.  Keep the same color for all the shadows.  Do lines near the edges of all the moldings. Make small shadows under the pumpkins and cat.  Make shadows on the ledge in front of the fruits on the window sills.,  Do a shadow under the stems of the pumpkins.,  Punch up the kitty's features and behind his ears.  Detail the bow tie with darker green.,  It will bring a smile to the face of the viewer, especially cat lovers. \n 
 It involves getting the blessing through Abraham's seed for you and yours. \n It will become clear how to have command of these blessing in your storehouses and your lands (home, community, and extended community)... \n Realize that your storehouses is plural... to make you plentiful in goods and blessings, if you are in a place to receive them,...\n For, although no one is good, yet we all may do the greater works of the Lord by being a vessel of mercy that passes His blessings on. \n (Matthew 5) \n Consider this: Practice Nonviolent Communication to see how it helps in peacemaking in God's will (II Chronicles 7:13—14): \n "13 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; 14 If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sins, and will heal their land." \n Share the forgiveness and kindness of the Lord—shown to you by His children, and now be His child, be His man or woman, boy or girl. Accept God's sons and daughters as your family by grafting into God's family by the spirit of God. \n Keep the faith and pass on the Energy of God to the end of the age! \n (Malachi 3:10) \n Help others, "If you help the poor: you are lending to the Lord and He will repay you!" (Proverbs 19:17) The Bible says that is like "casting bread upon the waters": Then you are positioned to be rewarded 100 fold with a great catch (blessing): \n ' (Zechariah 4:6) \n 
 Apply emergency brake and chock the rear wheels. \n See jacking instructions in your owners manual. There might be a decal under the hood on the right front, passenger side, top of the radiator frame with jacking instructions., Do not allow the brake hose to kink or be stressed in any way., You might have to wiggle it a bit. Set it aside., You might have to wiggle it a bit, but it will pull straight towards you. Set it aside., Set it aside on a clean surface, Discard this cotter pin. Do not reuse., Make sure the front bearing does not fall on a dirty surface as it will come right off the spindle. I suggest placing some newspapers under the caliper before you pull it out., It should not require much force. Do not damage the seal if you can help it., Place your bearings, seals, nuts and washers in the jug and wash the old grease off completely. You can use a little gasoline or parts cleaner fluid, just use enough to cover the parts and allow you to clean them. No need to have any more left over stuff to dispose of later., Take care they do not get contaminated with dirt or any particles that might ruin the bearings later., My rotors were too thin to allow machining so I discarded them and bough new rotors. They will tell you if they can machine them or not. You might want to call ahead and make sure they have the new rotors if you need to purchase them., The rest of these instructions refer to the new rotors. the instructions apply to the old rotors as well., If so, just open the plastic to access the hub. Place the rotor on a clean surface with the rear facing up. Apply new bearing grease to the hub on the surfaces where the bearing will rest and turn as well as the area where the seal will seat and all in between., If you left the plastic around the rotor, you can handle it without worry of greasing the braking surface., Also grease the surfaces of the seal that will contact the bear bearing., Make sure it goes in the same way it was before. If the seal became damaged, use new seals., Hold it in place as you place the front bearing and washer over the spindle and into the hub. Secure it with the clean, greased nut., This is to seat the bearings properly., Do not apply any force with a wrench to the nut at this time. Replace the castellated nut cover and insert a new cotter pin into the hole (back up slightly if needed to match the hole, do not tighten to gain access to the next hole). Bend the legs of the cotter pin to prevent it from falling out. Now you might replace the hub cap by tapping back into the front hub until the ridge sets flush with the hub., Use pliers, you might have tho pull and wiggle them to get them off., You might need to tap them is place to make sure they are fully seated on the bracket. Otherwise you'll have problems installing the new pads., Avoid contaminating the braking surface of the pads with any grease or other substances. The front pad only requires lubricant on the edges that contact the shims., Remove about 3/4" of fluid and discard., Check periodically to make sure the bake fluid does not overflow from the reservoir. Remove brake fluid as needed to prevent it from spilling into the engine compartment and onto the floor., Lubricate the pins to make sure they slide easily inside the caliper casting. This is very important! Binding calipers are the cause of uneven pad wear and premature failure of the brakes., These bushings and screws were the ones you loosened to remove the caliper. They have some rubber bellows type seals over them. You might want to lubricate these bushings before reassembling the caliper onto the brake assembly., If you have done this to both sides of the truck, you are done with the brakes., Make sure the rotors spin freely and there is no noticeable play in the rotors. Replace the cap on the brake fluid reservoir and make sure the level appears more or less right (more about this later)., If you are using an impact wrench, make sure not to over-tighten., Now you can properly tighten the lug nuts. Use a torque wrench to do it with 1/2" diameter studs use 100ft/lbs of torque as an initial setting. Verify the proper torque for your particular application., Pump the brakes several times to make sure you have a pedal and it does not sink to the floor. Remove any chocks from your wheels and slowly drive forward and backwards to test your brakes. Caution! the brakes might not work as expected if the fluid level is not right of some error occurred during the installation. Use extreme care until you have verified that the brakes are functioning properly.
 To work well, the opening should not extend any further up than 1 inch below the knee.\n \n Try to keep your insert fabric close to the weight of the pants fabric. Denim with denim, twill with twill, etc. \n Choose a patterned fabric, an alternating color, or paint or embroider on your insert for contrast. You might also match the color and weight closely for a more a subtle version. \n You will sew the top of these slits closed (so that it doesn't tear anymore) later, when you add the insert (known as a 'gusset'). \n You will sew this back into place later when you hem the edge of the gusset. \n \n Be certain the diagonal cut is slightly longer than your slit length. \n When measuring where the bottom cut should begin, keep in mind that you are cutting twice the width that you are looking at because of the fold in your material (e.g. 4.5 inches will open to 9 inches). \n The reason for doing two pieces at once is to ensure that your gussets match in size and shape. \n It is best if you use the same amount of seam allowance as was used to create the pants. \n This will reinforce both your long seam as well as the top of the slit opening. You may want to backstitch several times over the top point of the slit to prevent unraveling later. \n As you top stitch, you will need to hold the area being sewn flat while allowing the pant leg to bunch up around the presser foot. \n Wear them proudly! \n 
 You'll need:\n \n \n Go to sleep a little earlier than usual, especially if you are skating in the morning. Set your alarm clock for around an hour to an hour and a half before you'll have to leave the next day. \n Shower if you need to, and then do your regular morning routines. Have a small, healthy breakfast, and don't eat too much. Some is better than none, as you don't want to feel faint before skating. It's a good idea to have some water or juice as well. After that, you can do anything you need or want to do until around twenty or thirty minutes before you will have to go. \n Do not have anything to eat or drink unless you absolutely need to from here until when you are done skating, as you don't want to ruin the dress. You should also do your hair (wear it up; never leave your hair down, unless it's very short, at skating competitions) and make-up now. It's a good idea to still bring along all of your hair items and make-up along, as you will probably want to touch up there. \n Once you are at the rink, register, get your gift bag if they are giving them out, and relax until you have practice ice or your group warm-up. You can talk to other skaters or coaches, watch other programs, explore the rink, or look through the racks of skating items that vendors are usually selling. \n Don't spend time talking to fellow skaters, or working on moves that aren't in your program, especially riskier ones. Run through your program as much as you can. Remember to look up and smile, and time yourself using the stopwatch if you will be having a time limit. \n Use the restroom, spray on some more hairspray, touch up your make-up, brush your teeth... whatever you need! This is a good time to start stretching. \n Hold your stuffed animal or favorite item if you brought one, visualize yourself winning, practice your program on the ground, talk to your coach, jump around to get your jitters out; whatever makes you feel good is fine. Remember to take off your warm-up jacket and gloves and take deep breaths. Believe that you're going to win; a positive attitude helps! \n Look up and smile like you practiced, and don't feel rushed. Do all your elements as best as you can, and be proud of yourself, no matter what place you take. \n But if you had placings on the program, get ready for your exhibition program later in the day or even after the awards ceremony, which mean you have to get changed all over again.
 If your body is not limber during a back handspring, there's a chance you won't adjust properly to the flip. Regardless of the sport you're practicing for, it's always important to give your body a bit of a warm up before the fact. \n Stretch and roll your wrists. This is the area that risks the most strain when you execute your back handspring, so it's a good idea to give it some extra love prior to attempting the technique.\n A hard surface won't give you the cushion you need to spring back, and the risks of injury are much higher. Investing in a mat will allow you to practice your back handsprings from virtually any location. \n To do a needle kick, raise your knees, and launch your leg out in a kicking motion. Repeat this 15-20 times for each leg to complete a full set. \n Doing a set of these before attempting a back handspring will ensure your leg muscles are properly warmed up for the technique. \n A trampoline offers a safe, welcoming arena to practice your backflips. If you're relatively new to back handsprings and flips in general, practicing them on a trampoline helps to alleviate the fear of injuring yourself. \n You should practice these as part of your regular workout. Aim your arms downward and lay your hands flat on the ground. Holding your hands in place, launch yourself forward and lift your legs off the ground. Handstands can be held for several seconds or longer if you have the flexibility and strength. They may take a long time to master, but it's a necessary step to take if you want to get good at back handsprings. \n Training up your handstand balance will make it easier to control the stage of a back handspring when your hands meet the ground. Being used to the experience of a handstand will make the back handspring feel more fluid. \n Training yourself with 20 second handstands in reps of 5 is a good place to start if you already have the basics figured out., A vault board will give you the extra force necessary to achieve a flip. This will allow you to focus on other facets of your technique. \n Using a vault board can help you to focus on improving your control, rather than putting the effort into the force of jumping itself. This is particularly helpful if you have difficulty with the initial leap. \n Rest your back against wall, and lower your body down. This will cause a bend in your legs. Get your squat down to the point where your legs are arched at a 90 degree angle. This should cause a noticeable burn in your leg muscles. \n If your legs are stronger, you'll be able to leap higher, giving your back handspring greater initial force. \n Hold your squat for 30 seconds, then give yourself 30 seconds to rest before you attempt another rep. \n Whether at a subscription gym or as part of a gymnastics team, getting help from a coach can take you from being good to great. It is especially helpful if you have a positive working relationship with the coach. Many coaches find satisfaction in seeing their students thrive. This can have a positive moralizing effect on you if you're feeling frustrated by the learning curve. \n Having a coach around can also help limit the risk of personal injury if he doubles as a spotter. \n It's a common mistake for beginning gymnasts to bend their backs as they execute this manoeuvre. Unfortunately, this makes it more difficult for your body's weight to complete the flip, and you have an increased risk of injury if your spine is at an arc. \n If you have had some training doing wall squats, the wall squat position is the stance you'll want to be in as you launch yourself backwards. Bring your legs to a near-90 degree angle. This will maximize your body's force as you launch upwards. \n This reduces the risk of injury. It also helps ensure that your weigh is evenly displaced on both sides. If your head is turned one way or another, you will have a tendency to shift your body's weight in that direction. \n This will offer you the opportunity of analyzing your technique objectively. There may be things you notice yourself doing on video that you weren't conscious about when you were doing it. \n Tumbling and round-offs are just a couple of the techniques gymnasts tend to combine back handsprings with. Although juggling multiple techniques at once ups the challenge, you'll know you have mastered the handspring itself when you're able to combine it with ease. \n Regular, sufficient sleep is especially important if you're into athletics. Getting between 7-9 hours is optimal, although you may want more if you have a particularly straining athletics test the next day. \n With proper rest, you'll be able to execute greater back handsprings with less conscious effort. \n If you have a friend who is training in the same skills you are, you'll be able to help each other. One of you can act as a spotter while the other executes the techniques. Above all, the moralizing aspect of training as a team will push you past the boundaries you thought you had. \n Drinking ample water helps to ensure that your joints are lubricated. If you're dehydrated, your body won't function at the level it should. \n Ample water intake will loosen up your joints, giving your body greater flexibility when you attempt a back handspring. \n Some athletes believe you should multiply your body weight by 0.6 to arrive at the number of ounces you should be drinking each day if you're wanting to get serious about athletics., If you feel like you're not cut out for a back handspring, you'll have a low chance of pulling it off regardless of your physical aptitude. Go into each training session with a positive outlook. You should take comfort in the fact you are going out of your way to hone your body and improve yourself. \n Back handsprings are difficult, and require a fair amount of focus on the part of the gymnast. If you have issues with self-confidence, clearing up the emotional aspect will see tangible improvements in your technique. \n 
 It will represent who you are throughout the site so something clever will score you points, while something raunchy will only attract the wrong type of people. Most sites also offer a Heading/Catch Phrase/Tag Line that appears in the searches to draw people into your profile. Humor often works best. It engages people by creating a reaction in their mind of laughter, a pleasure-seeking bait of wanting to laugh more if they read what else you have to say. I myself used: “We can always say we met at the supermarket“, or something quirky like: “Seeking out all the toilet paper scrunchers!“ \n \n A lot of us introverts are camera shy but having a photo is essential for any online dating profile. In most sites you can choose to filter people out without a photo. Whenever someone performs a search for a match, the only details that appear in the search results are your username, age, location, tagline and your photo. So what will make a person take more interest in learning more about you than any of the other 50 profiles in the search result? How attractive they find you. Selecting a photo with someone significantly less attractive than yourself would create the perfect perceptual contrast of increasing your appeal. \n But for the more ethical: \n Current photos are ideal. Many people use old photos of their former and more attractive selves. It’s an ingenious idea at the beginning… until you have to meet the person you’re talking with, and have to reassure them that they didn’t sleep in and arrive 20 years late for your date… \n More than one photo allows for people to get a more three dimensional idea of what you look like in different contexts. Preferably include at least one head shot and one full body shot. \n Be original and grab people's attention to receive higher responses. This could be perfect if you’re a bit shy and don’t want to show a picture of yourself. For example, you could put one picture up of you wearing a costume, or one where you draw a smiley face on a piece of paper and cover your face with it. These kinds of pictures will add a touch of quirky playfulness, while adding a sense of mystery so that people want more. \n Details in picking the image will make all the difference. If you’re aiming at attracting geeks or nerds then photos with your glasses on or playing your favorite video games will work wonders. If you’d like an adventurer like yourself, a photo of yourself rock climbing is perfect. Also keep in mind the small things like lighting in the photo, clothes you’re wearing and even the size of your pupils. A psychology study analyzing pupil sizes discovered that we find large pupils more inviting and attractive, just as I mentioned in another article.\n How often have you seen the same repetitive: “I love to have fun and be spontaneous!!!“, as opposed to what? Not liking to have fun? And saying you’re spontaneous makes it sound planned. Listing sports, movies, music and travel as your interests is uninteresting, most people like a certain sport, movie, song or place to go to. Also, generalizing your tastes by saying for instance “I like all kinds of music” is just a falsified cover-up to make yourself appear that you’re cultured, when in fact you’re actually dispassionate and boring. Writing: “I like to visit India because it’s such an ancient culture rich with variety, spirituality, acceptance and color” would be much more revealing of who you are. Here are some helpful hints: \n \n The opening lines are pivotal for the success of your self bio. Just like in many writing formats, how you open your paragraphs will either hook your reader in and entice them to read further or will dull them away. It will be difficult, but craft the first sentence very carefully. \n The length should preferably be around 300 words. The internet generation is one of impatience, nobody likes reading 3-mouse-scroll-downs lengths of text. Too little text however and you’ll come across as empty, lazy, lifeless and boring. Too much and you’re obsessive, psycho and neurotic. \n Spelling is one of the pet-peeves of many. Spelling words correctly makes your writing flow a lot more smoothly, as does using punctuation and new paragraphs. If your reader unconsciously feels the tension of having to decipher your spelling mistakes, then that anxiety will also influence their perception of you. Furthermore, your choice of words can change the meaning of what you want to convey entirely. “I don’t want to die alone” is a common fear. “I want someone to die with” is a suicide pact. \n If you consider yourself caring, instead of writing that, why not share that you enjoy cooking for your parents or coaching your nephews soccer team? \n For instance: what it is you aspire to do in life, what hobbies bring you the greatest joy, what qualities you value in others. The more important things you reveal about yourself, whether favorite movie or favorite ice cream flavor, the more chances someone will read your profile and think: “wow, this person sounds so much like me“. \n Instead of stating: “No old creepy men”, “I’d like someone around my age to be able to grow old with” sounds much more warm and positive. Instead of “No non-christians”, “My religion plays a huge role in my life” is much more welcoming. \n Be unique. \n 
 By now you've probably been looking at colleges and have a few potential ones in mind. Find out what each school's required SAT score for entry is. This will give you a goal score.There are several ways to get this information. \n Schools often publish this information on official websites, usually under the "Admissions" section. If you can't find what you need on the school websites, try doing an internet search of the school's name and "SAT score requirement." This way you can avoid searching around the school websites. \n Call or email the school's admissions office and ask for their SAT score requirements. There are advisers there whose job it is to answer any questions prospective students may have, so you shouldn't be shy about asking them for information. \n Some schools don't have a minimum score for entry. If this is the case, use these methods to find the average SAT scores for their incoming freshman class. This will give you an idea of what you should aim for. \n If there is a lot of variation in the scores each school requires, make the highest one your goal. That way, you'll cover all your bases.\n There are a number of quality SAT review books available at most book stores and local libraries.Some top test books include:College Board Official SAT Study Guide. Also known as the Blue Book, this prep book is published by the company that makes the SAT. It contains 10 full-length tests. It is known to be particularly useful for math sections, because it contains detailed descriptions of every problem. It also comes with a DVD that has further advice and tips. \n Kaplan SAT Premier. This has eight full tests with explanations to answers. It also comes with a companion DVD, offering videos with further explanation. \n Gruber's Complete SAT Guide. This book focuses on test taking techniques that will improve your scores and help you find the right answers quickly. In addition, it has five full tests. \n Baron's SAT. Baron's publishes quality books for almost all standardized tests. The SAT book explains all answers, but is known for having a high-quality reading section. The 2015 edition had five full tests, plus another two on the companion CD. \n It is best to use a combination of these books and others. That way, you'll maximize your chances of seeing the most questions possible. \n Make sure these books were published in or after 2005. The SAT was reformatted in 2005 and older books, while still helpful, won't prepare you for this new version as well as a current book. \n While it may seem strange to do this before any prep, doing this will give you a good idea of what your strengths and weaknesses are. It will also give you the baseline score you need to improve.Make sure you're in a quiet area where you won't be disturbed at all. and you have several hours to devote to this. Time yourself and stick to the time requirements. \n The full SAT is 3 hours and 45 minutes. \n There is a 70 minute math section. This breaks down into two 25 minute parts and one 20 minute part. \n There is a 70 minute critical reading section. This breaks down into two 25 minute parts and one 20 minute part. \n There is a 60 minute writing section. This breaks down to two 25 minute parts and one 10 minute part. \n There is a 25 minute experimental section. This is ungraded, but you should still complete it so you can build up your endurance. \n You are allowed three 5 minute breaks, one after each section. During this time you're allowed to stretch, go to the bathroom, and have a drink and snack. Only eat or drink during breaks to accurately recreate the testing experience. \n Stick carefully to these time limits. One of your problems could be that you have trouble finishing in the allotted time, so you'll need to know if this is something you have to improve on. \n This is more than a matter of finding out what your score is. You need to go through the test and find out exactly where you made mistakes. As you move on and work to improve your grade, you'll need to know where your trouble spots are and where you need to focus your efforts., Many students decide to self-prep, which is essentially just utilizing study guides to prepare for the SAT. However, many people fall short of their goals, and in some cases a quality prep course would have significantly improved a students chances of scoring higher on their SAT. A student must assess whether or not they need that extra push to study effectively. Prep courses do a great job at holding students accountable and keeping them engaged. \n If you are the student that has a history of not following through with studying or has trouble staying focused, then a prep course might be your best bet. If you do decide to use a prep course, it's extremely important to consider many factors when assessing what prep course might be the best for you. \n One of the most important factors to pay attention to is whether or not you're getting quality content with your prep course purchase. There are many companies trying to get in the prep course game, but they all don't have the same level of content quality. Make sure to do your research on the company before you make a prep course purchase, and seriously consider trying to get access to a free trial before making your prep course purchase. \n There are many words that repeat themselves from year to year. If you read enough practice tests, chances are good that when you take the test you've seen a majority of the words before.You don't need to purchase these practice books- you can just flip through these sections at the bookstore or library. \n College Board, the company that designs the SAT, offers free sample test questions and sections on its website., Keep a notebook and write down words you don't know as you come across them. Take a dictionary and define them afterwards. Also include whether the word is a noun, verb, etc.Set up your book in columns. Draw a line down the middle of the page to divide the columns. Put the words on the left, and the definitions on the right. This way, you can either put a piece of paper or your hand over the definitions while you study. \n Make sure your notebook is small enough to conveniently carry around with you. That way, any down time you have can be used for study. \n You could also try a few websites dedicated to improving vocabulary. That way you can access them on your smartphone anywhere., Set time aside to work on your vocabulary. Go through your notebook, cover the definitions, and define as many words as you can without looking. \n For words you don't know, say the definitions aloud a few times to help you remember them for next time. \n Use the words in a sentence. This will not only help you understand their meanings, but prepare you to use them in your essay and in the reading comprehension sections. \n Use the words in everyday life. When you get comfortable with a word's definition, put it to use. When these words become normal parts of your vocabulary, they'll be much easier to figure out on the SAT. \n Many companies that publish review books also make vocabulary flashcards. They can usually fit easily in your pocket or bag, so they may be more convenient to carry around than your notebook. \n With apps, you'll always have a study resource at your fingertips. For example, SAT and ACT Vocabulary Builder by AccelaStudy uses a dynamic approach to flashcards by specifically focusing on words you've had trouble with., Sentence completion questions have one or two blank spaces. You have to pick the word or words that best complete the sentence. Improving your vocabulary will help here, but it's unlikely you'll know all the words. That's why it's important to know some strategies to help you break down sentences and pick the right answer. \n You don't need to know the definitions of the words most of the time, you just need the context the sentence provides., A clause is a part of a sentence that contains a noun and a verb, and conveys a complete idea. The sentence completion questions almost always present you with compound sentences, meaning they contain two or more clauses. The clauses are usually linked by a conjunction, which are words like "but," "and," "so," and "because."For example: "I went to the store, but it was closed." This sentence contains two clauses, linked by the conjunction "but." \n The type of conjunction tells you how the clauses are related.One-way switch. These conjunctions tell you that the sentence flows in one direction. That means the clauses both support the main idea of the sentence. Some one-way switches are: and, because, since, so, and therefore. \n Here's a one-way switch: "I got in my car and drove to work." The "and" tells us that the two clauses support each other. \n Two-way switch. This type of conjunction tells us that there will be a break in the sentence's flow. That means the second clause will negate something in the first. Some of these are: but, although, despite, however, and while. \n Here's a two-way switch: "I got in my car but it wouldn't start." The "but" tells us that the second clause will be inconsistent with the first. Presumably, this person got in their car to go somewhere, but they now can't go anywhere because the car won't start. \n Sentences without a switch are all one-way, unless they're about change over time. Sentences that describe change over time are two-way. \n Now that you know how to break down a sentence, you can start working out how to solve a sentence completion question. Using the rules about one-and two-way switches, figure out the flow of the sentence. \n "Johnny didn't even know how to ride a bike, but he _____ the race anyway." The "but" tells us that we have a two-way switch here. Already, without even seeing any choices, you know that the right choice will contrast with Johnny not knowing how to ride a bike. \n That way, you can pick the choice most like the word you had in mind. \n When you've broken the sentence down, figured out its flow, and picked a word to complete it, then look at the choices. All the previous steps will make it much easier to spot the correct choice. \n If you're completely stuck on vocabulary, start eliminating choices. Even if you have to guess, every choice you eliminate makes your chances better. \n These are usually the typical length and difficulty of SAT reading sections. Read an article and understand its point.Ask yourself what the main idea of the article is. \n After deciding on the main idea, make the article's scope more specific. If you read about volcanoes in Hawaii, saying that the article was about Earth science is too broad. In a short sentence, say the article's topic and scope. \n If you're unsure that you understood an article properly, ask a teacher or tutor to read it. Then tell them the short summary sentence you came up with. They can tell you if you've properly understood the article or if you made a mistake somewhere. \n Make notes next to the article to help yourself comprehend it better. \n You don't get to pick the topics for the reading comprehension sections, so chances are good you'll find at least one of the sections very boring. Unfortunately, we tend to skim and not pay attention to topics we have no interest in, which could lead you to get questions wrong. Get yourself used to paying attention to boring topics by purposely reading things you don't find interesting., There are a few types of questions the SAT usually asks. Understanding these can help you figure out the answer.Main Idea. These ask about the point of the article as a whole. \n Inference. This will ask you about something that isn't directly stated in the article, but rather implied. \n Detail. These will ask you about a specific section of the article. \n Vocabulary. These will ask you to define a word based on how it is used in the passage. \n Function. These ask you about the purpose of a specific part of the passage. \n We all think differently, and there really isn't one golden rule on how to tackle reading comprehension sections. All strategies have positives and negatives. Try these on your practice tests and see which one works best for you.Read through passages fully, then move onto the questions. \n Read the questions first, then read the passages. \n Skim the passage, then read the questions and refer back to the passage when you have to. \n If one strategy isn't working for you, try another. \n Because the SAT has strict time constraints, you shouldn't read every word of every passage. Use the following techniques to get all the necessary information in the shortest amount of time.Read the introduction paragraph. This should layout the main idea and topic of the passage. \n Only read the first and last sentences of paragraphs after this. Effectively constructed paragraphs will give an introduction that summarizes the paragraph, and a conclusion that wraps it up. \n Circle or underline important words or terms. Key terms will vary from passage to passage and will be based on the passage's main idea. For example, if you're reading a passage about climate change, terms like "rising sea levels," "greenhouse gas," and "pollution" will likely be important. \n Longer passages usually have several paragraphs. Each paragraph has a particular topic in relation to the main idea of the reading. Take only a few seconds to come up with a very fast, one-sentence summary of each paragraph. That way, if questions ask about a particular section of the passage, you know exactly where to go., Since you've read the passage, you'll probably have an idea of what the right answer is. Find the answer that best matches your prediction. This will prevent you from wasting time by referring back to the passage looking for answers., Many students have trouble sticking to the time constraints in reading comprehension sections. If it takes you more than a minute to answer a question, skip it, or you risk running out of time. If you can eliminate even one choice, then it is best to take a guess., Just like with vocabulary words, there are a limited number of math questions the SAT can ask, so over the years there will be similar or identical questions. \n SAT Math breaks down into four areas: Numbers and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, and Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability.There are 44 multiple choice questions and 10 fill-ins. \n Multiple choice questions give you a few opportunities to solve them. If you know how, you can solve them mathematically and pick the right answer. If you're stuck and don't know how to solve a problem, you can try substitution. This means you plug answers into the equation from the question and see what you get. Remember that SAT answers always go from lowest to highest, so this can give you an idea of which answer to start with. With multiple choice questions, you can also always guess. \n Fill-ins. These have no answer choices, so this eliminates the possibility of substitution or guessing easily. You'll have to actually solve them. The best thing you can do here is study and practice your mathematical concepts., You may find that you have issues with one particular type of problem. If all the questions you get wrong are geometry, you know what you need to focus on. \n It's true that the SAT booklet includes all relevant formulas.However, you still need to know when and how to use them. Just like with your vocabulary words, make note of formulas you need to know and write down what situations you would use them for. \n Although you aren't graded for showing your work, this will prevent you from making careless mistakes. If you work everything out in your head, you could lose track of your work and make a preventable mistake., These can be tricky, and many students get them wrong because they are confused by the wording. \n Before doing any work, ask yourself: "What is this question asking me?"That way, you can make sure you understand what exactly you're supposed to solve in this question.Write out all important parts of the question. Word problems often confuse us with unimportant sections. For instance, if a question starts with, "John's mom put three apples in his lunchbox for school today," write "3 apples." That way, by the end you should have a simple math problem without all the confusing wording. \n This is helpful in many ways. For example, if you're in a rush and a problem asks you to calculate a certain angle, you may not have time to do a lengthy equation. However, three of the choices are acute angles and the fourth is obtuse. You see that the angle is clearly greater than a right angle. Since the figure is drawn to scale, you can correctly choose the obtuse angle., Don't rely on your imagination to visualize shapes- draw them. Like showing your work, this will help you catch mistakes before you make a careless error.\n iTooch SAT Math is an app currently for iPhones and iPads, and is under construction for Windows and Androids. It has a large database of questions and includes math games to help you practice in a more entertaining way.SAT Math Testbank. This app is compatible with Apple products. It isn't flashy and includes a large question database., The writing section asks you to take a side on a broad issue, then defend it with examples. So while grammar and spelling are important as well, what graders are looking for is how well you can support an argument., The top bun is the introduction, the middle is the body and supporting examples, the bottom bun is the conclusion.Introduction. Here you should state what your position on the debate is. It helps to rephrase the original question in some way. Then, tell the reader what your position is and why. \n Body. Here is where your examples will go. Use one paragraph per example. This is enough room to elaborate on the example and why it proves your point, but not so long that you'll take too long and won't finish. \n Conclusion. Remind the reader what your position was. Explain why the examples you used demonstrate this point. \n It is much better to have two well-thought out and coherent points than five jumbled and poorly considered points. It is helpful to pre-plan a few examples that are applicable in many different situations.Historical examples. In your history classes, you've probably encountered a number of people and events that would be great supporting evidence in an essay. For example, if the essay prompt is "Can we learn from failure?" you could say that Abraham Lincoln was a great leader because he was always willing to learn from his past mistakes. \n Literary examples. Authors almost always include moral or social lessons in their work. You've probably read plenty of these in English class. Novels like 1984 and To Kill a Mockingbird are standards in most high schools, and contain great examples you can use in a number of different essays. \n Current events examples. The news is full of examples you can use in almost any argument. Good topics include censorship, military actions, political developments, and social justice. \n Essays don't have to be long to be good. It will be obvious to the grader if you're just adding words and sections to make your essay longer. It's much better to have a shorter essay with strong examples than a long essay full of fluff., Although the point is to defend your position, it shows that you are a powerful writer if you can at least acknowledge the other point of view. This doesn't have to be long- even a sentence will show that you've considered other side of the issue.For example, if the question is asking whether it is right for the government to monitor its citizens, you could say, "While many would argue that monitoring citizens is essential for national security, it is a violation of our constitutional rights." \n Although the main point is to defend your argument, it shows a level of maturity in your writing if you can go beyond words like "good" and "bad."Make absolutely sure, however, that you're using complicated words correctly. It could be a mark against you if you keep misusing words. \n It will hurt your chances of a good score if your essay is full of grammar and spelling mistakes. Also be sure to write legibly- the grader can't give you a good score if he can't read your essay. \n If writing is your weak spot, the best way to improve your score is to do write out the essay questions from SAT books and websites. Do these as if you were actually taking the test. Do not look at the question before you start. Stick to the 25 minute time limit and see if you can write an entire essay with an introduction, conclusion, and examples. Then on test day, you'll be in good shape to write an essay with little trouble., There are typically five choices for SAT answers. That means you have a 1 in 5 chance of guessing correctly. However, for every answer you eliminate, it's more likely you'll guess correctly. If you don't know an answer but are absolutely sure 4 choices are wrong, you've just found the correct answer., It's very important to understand exactly what questions are asking you. If you only breeze through or skip the instructions, you'll almost certainly make mistakes. \n If you get stuck on a question and can't eliminate any choices, skip it. You'll waste time trying to figure it out when you could be answering questions you know. When you finish that section, you can come back to questions you skipped if there's time left. However, remember with every choice you eliminate your chances of guessing right improve. If you can eliminate even one answer, it is better to guess.If you skip questions, be certain you fill in the correct bubbles on your scantron as you move on. If you don't pay attention, you could end up filling in the wrong bubbles for all the questions after the one you skipped, meaning the whole section will be wrong. \n The SAT is an exhausting test, so reading in general will help you. This is effective not just for reading sections, but for the whole test. It will help you keep your concentration for long periods of time.\n Bring a watch. While proctors are supposed to keep track for you, you should be sure you know exactly how much time you have left.Figure out how much time you have per question. In a 20 minute section with 25 questions, you have 48 seconds per question. Keep this in mind to see if you're falling behind and have to pick up the pace. \n If you start running out of time, just answer easy questions. That way you'll complete the section as much as possible. You'll also probably have time to go back and work on harder ones with this method. \n Be prepared. After practicing all this time, you know the deal. You know the test's layout and what's required in each section. You've done timed practice tests. This will all help make it easier for you to finish in enough time., How long you'll spend prepping really depends on your goals. It also depends on how much free time you have for study. As a general rule, less than two weeks is not enough time for adequate prep. But you don't want to take too long either- if you start a year in advance, you'll probably forget a lot.Overall, 1 to 3 months is a good goal. This allows you enough time to let all the information sink in without risking forgetting anything., With flashcards and apps, you can study pretty much anywhere. If you're on the bus on the way to school, try doing a few math problems or flipping through some vocabulary flashcards. Little things like this can make huge differences. \n If you have any questions or are having trouble in a particular area, ask your teacher in that subject for help. Teachers will be happy to give you extra help. \n Working through test books by yourself may not be enough, and you might require some explanation to help you. \n Many schools offer after school classes for SAT prep. Find out if your school has one of these, or if you could get one started. \n Check the internet and see if there are prep classes in your area. Remember that these are sometimes expensive. \n 
 Rummage through your wardrobe looking for green pants, socks, shoes and shirts of the same shade. If you are missing an item of clothing, visit your local thrift store. The clothing is often separated by color and the prices are cheap.Wear one of the items you already have when you go shopping. This ways you can match the colors at the store. \n Look for hoodies to give you that green cover on your head. \n Consider wearing tights and a leotard. If you choose to do this, match the leotard to your shell color. \n Look for green mittens to cover your hands. You can also use green body paint for your hands if you can’t fin green mittens.\n Decide in advance whether you want to cover all of your skin in green or if you would rather opt for some green accents on your face. \n Face paint can be found at a costume shop or hobby shop. If Halloween is coming up, you may also be able to find it available in the seasonal section of your local pharmacy., Decide which method you will use to create your shell and make sure you get everything you will need. \n If you are making a shell out of a roasting pan, get a disposable aluminum roasting pan. These can be found in grocery stores and dollar stores in the baking section. Look for a pan with an oval shape which has a pattern stamped into the bottom for catching grease, which looks similar to the pattern on a shell. These are usually used for roasting large birds like turkeys.Choose your paint. You will want some dark brown and dark green spray paint. If you choose to make some color accents on your shell, you can also pick up some water-based acrylics and big paint brushes at your local hobby shop.Purchase some painters tape. This is available at a hobby shop or hardware store. You want to get some which is thin and will fit in the molded lines of the pan, about 3/4 inch wide.Pick up some wide brown ribbon. You may be able to find this in the stationary section of your local Target or Walmart. You can also get ribbon at a hobby shop or fabric store. This is going to be used to strap the shell to your back. Opt for a ribbon which is strong and will be comfortable on your shoulders. \n If you choose to make your shell out of felt, you will need some dark green and light green felt along with a few other items. Make sure you purchase enough dark green felt to create an oval which will cover your back, as well as another oval 3 inches (7.6 cm) larger than the first. You will need half as much light green felt. \n Get a glue gun and glue sticks. \n This method requires a sewing machine and you will want to get dark green thread if you don’t already have some. \n Purchase a large bag of stuffing. Thicker stuffing used for stuffed animals is a better choice then a softer pillow stuffing. \n Find one or two large pieces of cardboard. You will need a surface large enough to create an oval large enough to cover your back. You may want two ovals of the same size to reinforce the base of your shell. \n Pick up some wide dark green ribbon to match your dark green felt. You may be able to find this in the stationary section of your local Target or Walmart. You can also get ribbon at a hobby shop or fabric store. This is going to be used to strap the shell to your back. Opt for a ribbon which is strong and will be comfortable on your shoulders. \n The pan is already pretty close to looking like a turtle shell, which is really convenient. It is also easily malleable if you would like to make any adjustments. \n If the lip on the pan is really large, fold it over into the inside of the pan to reduce the squared corners. Avoid cutting this section, which could leave sharp edges. \n Push out from the inside of the pan to round out the bends in the roasting pan until the sides look more rounded like a turtle shell. \n This is where the ribbon will be threaded to hold the pan on your back, so think about where the straps of a backpack would go. Put two holes in the top corners of the pan and two in the bottom. It is helpful to put the top holes and little wider apart and the bottom holes a little closer together by about one inch. This has the effect of cinching the straps near your waist. The holes should be about the size of the width of a pen or pencil. \n Use a drill to make these holes if you have one. \n The pan can also be punctured with other sharp tools like scissors or a screwdriver. \n You will want to cover both the inside and outside of the pan, as some of the inside may be visible. Spray paint the entire roasting pan with your dark brown spray paint on the inside and outside of the pan. Allow this layer to dry for about 15-20 minutes. \n These will become the lines between the scales of the turtle shell and you want them to remain the dark brown color. \n If your tape is too wide for the crevices, cut it to fit. \n Don’t worry about making this layer too thick. Allowing some of the brown to show through the green paint will give the shell a nice textured look. \n For even more texture, use a large paint brush and green acrylic paint to dry brush on the green color. Squeeze the paint onto a palette and apply a small amount of paint to the brush without using any water. Lightly brush the green over the brown spray paint using cross strokes. \n You want to make sure it is completely dry before you move on. Make sure it is dry to the touch, especially along the edges where it may have gathered excess paint. \n The tape should not remove any of the paint underneath it. If it does, you can touch these areas up with a brown marker. \n You can use a pencil or screwdriver to help you get the ribbon through the hole. You will want to push it from the inside to the outside of the pan so that the majority of the ribbon is hanging on the inside to create your shoulder strap. \n Make sure the knot is big enough that it will not slip through the hole. If it is too small, tie it a second time to make the knot bigger. \n You should now have two ribbons hanging from the top of the shell on the inside of the pan. \n Push the ends of the ribbons into the holes in the bottom of the shell to make two shoulder straps. You will want to push them from the inside out again. Don’t tie knots yet. \n In order to get the straps the correct length, it is best to have a friend hold the shell in place on your back before you tie knots in the bottom of the ribbons. \n Pull the ribbons tight until the shell feels secure on your back, then tie knots in both ribbons to complete the shoulder straps. \n This should be an appropriate size to fit on your back. If the cardboard seems flimsy, you could cut a second oval out of cardboard and glue the two together for reinforcement. \n Place the cardboard oval on top of the dark green felt. Using a pencil, hold the tip as close as you can keep it to the edge of the cardboard as you trace around the oval onto the felt. \n It is useful to keep one edge of the oval on the edge of the felt to make it easier to cut from the felt. \n Make sure you are saving enough felt to create a second, larger oval. \n Using fabric scissors, carefully cut the oval from the fabric staying on the pencil line as much as possible. \n Place the cardboard oval on the remainder of the dark green felt. \n Measure three inches from the edge of the cardboard oval and move around the cardboard drawing dots on the felt three inches from the edge of the cardboard all the way around the oval. \n Connect the dots with a pencil to draw an oval three inches larger than the original oval \n Using fabric scissors, carefully cut this oval out of the dark green felt. \n Machine baste this oval using as long a stitch as possible. \n Pull one of the threads on the large oval to draw the edges in toward the center of the oval. Tie a knot in both threads to hold them in place. \n Don’t skimp on the stuffing. Use as much as you can possible get into the oval. \n Place your cardboard base on top of the stuffed oval. Wrap the edges of the felt over the cardboard and attach it to the cardboard using hot glue. \n Think of these straps as those on a backpack to help you place them. \n Place the slits in the bottom of the oval about one inch closer together than the slits on the top in order to create a cinching effect near the waist to keep the shell more secure on your back. \n Pinch the felt between your thumb and forefinger where you are going to create the slit in order to cut within the fabric as opposed to starting from the edge. \n Push the edge of the ribbon through the slits in the top of the small oval. The smaller bit of the ribbon will be on the underside of the felt oval. The length will create the straps. Push the other end of the ribbons through the slits in the bottom of the oval. \n Attach the top of the straps first, then glue the oval over the gathered edges of your shell to create a back to your shell. \n Place the oval over the cardboard to completely cover the back of your shell. \n Glue the small part of the ribbon to the cardboard to create the top of the straps. \n Attach the small felt oval to the cardboard using hot glue around the edges. Start at the top and working your way down. Stop before you reach the bottom of the oval. \n Attach the bottom of the straps to the cardboard before gluing the rest of the oval onto the cardboard. It is helpful to place the shell on your back at this point to get the appropriate length for your straps before gluing them. \n Finish gluing the rest of the oval over the cardboard base. \n You will need several shapes to cover the shell. Use hexagons,squares and a four-sided shape with one rounded side, resembling an ice-cream cone shape. \n Cut 5 hexagons out of the lighter green felt. The top and bottom lines should be longer than the other lines creating the triangular points on the sides. Cut two of these hexagons in half. \n Make enough small squares to cover the entire edge of the shell, leaving space between each tile to let the dark green felt show through the space between the squares. \n Cut 6 of the four-sided shapes which will cover the top and the bottom of the shell. These shapes will create the scales filling the top and the bottom of the shell between the hexagonal scales. They should have one short side for the bottom, then two sides splaying out at a diagonal and a rounded top. \n Start by placing one in the very center of the shell with the long sides running on the top and bottom of the hexagon so the shape is placed longways. \n Leaving enough space to allow the dark green felt to make lines between the scales, glue one hexagon above the center one, and the other hexagon below the center one. \n The points of the half hexagons should fit between the points of the top and center, and bottom and center whole hexagons. \n The points will face toward the center of the shell with the cut end facing the edge of the shell. Leave enough space between the scales to allow the dark green felt to create lines between the scales. \n It may be helpful to design these shapes once the others are in place to make sure that they fit appropriately to cover the top and bottom edges of the shell while leaving space between the shapes to allow the dark green bottom layer to create lines between the scales. Glue these 6 shapes in place. \n Glue the squares all the way around the edges of the shell to complete the scales. Leave enough space between the square to allow the dark green felt to show through and create lines all the way around the squares. \n It is helpful to place the squares all the way around the shell before gluing them to make sure that you have enough space to fit them all completely within the edges. \n If you don’t have enough space when you complete your circle, you may need to cut one of the squares to fit the space available. Finish at the bottom of the shell. \n Cover yourself in green from head to toe with green shoes, socks, pants and shirt. \n A green hoodie is a good option to cover your head in green. You can also try skull cap hat. \n You may opt for green tights and a brown leotard to match your shell. \n Don’t forget your face when it comes to your costume. You can use as much or as little makeup as you choose. \n Apply a full layer of green face paint to cover your face, neck and ears. Cover your skin in green a little past the collar of your shirt to make sure you’re skin color won’t show when your shirt shifts as you move. If you didn’t find green mittens, you will also want to paint your hands. \n If you choose not to completely cover your skin in green, you can opt to just do some green highlights like eyeshadow. \n Put your arms through the straps and make sure it’s snug. If the shell shifts around too much as you move, take it off and shorten the straps about an inch on each side. \n 
 You will not see yourself represented well - unless enough people support, influence and help the right people into positions like city council, commissioners, district courts, legislators, elected judges -not just the executives (the mayor, county manager, district attorney or county judge's office, governor or even president)! \n What changes will happen as a result of the reforms you vote for? Will these changes be for the better? Will there be some pain in the short run? Consider all of these carefully. \n Sometime well before elections, contact the party or candidate that you support and volunteer to be a poll-watcher, if this is legal in your local election process. \n You would receive instructions about the duties such as watching out for wrong deeds like electioneering (standing between incoming voters and the polling booths with propaganda of any kind). You would not interfere but only observe and report to designated authorities. \n You should receive some identification for that candidate or party and the information about who you would call or contact, if you believe there are irregularities or lawbreaking in the polling place.\n These meetings take place for the purpose of deciding what will be on the agenda in the coming year, etc. They are often set up to be held at the end of the party primary-day so be at the polling place just before the poll closes to be admitted at each community voting place. (Some states use "town hall or caucus"--small convention style meetings--instead of individually balloting, so find out what time to be there to participate.) \n At the primary precinct meeting your polling place officers are elected, as well as delegates to the county meeting (at the county meeting they elect county party officials and also state convention delegates, etc.) and your issues (initiatives) are sent to the next level to be agreed upon or dropped. \n In many locales, the voters can wait or come back on the actual election day to the polling place just before the poll closes on that election evening and go to the meeting to watch the vote count, talk, and learn about the procedures and opportunities to get involved now or for next time. \n Plan for using a website; perhaps your county or state political party has a website on which you can get a webpage for your use. \n With individual work and effort, you reflect your values in local politics. \n There will be another election soon, and you can try again. \n Following a person is not going to change the core of your existence, but if you begin to suspect this is happening with someone you supported, admit you backed the wrong horse and withdraw your support immediately. The wrong person in an elected position can do great harm. \n Then when elected don't just say: "Oh it is worse than I knew, and we can not do those things right away. We'll do what we can." \n Setting the example you hope will become the ideal is all you can really do. Don't engage in behaviors that, if discovered, will undermine all the work you (and others committed to the same cause) have done. \n That will never come from bad politicians; rather, it will come from you and the your ideals. When you're talking about your views and it has engaged another person, then that individual will change the area around him or her. This can change the moral and social climate of any locale. \n You will need twenty valid signatures, so get forty to be on the safe side. All your signers must be registered to vote in your assembly district. If you are lucky, seven or less candidates are running and you are elected. If eight or more candidates filed a petition, then your name will appear on the ballot and voters will vote for you in the primary. Once you are elected, then that gives you an opportunity to be a delegate to the annual state convention. You will also have an opportunity to run for the executive board of the county party. You will become well known by the activists and they are the ones you need to launch a political career.
\n Some horses are not always trained to do flying lead changes. To train the horse, start by doing figure eights; canter one circle, slow down in the center to a walk, then go the other direction at the canter. Doing this helps the horse figure out that it is to switch leads when given a certain signal. \n For example, spiraling in at the trot, 5 meter circles, etc. \n Ask it to change direction normally (at a walk or trot). \n For the purpose of clarity in this explanation, the article will say the horse's stronger lead is its left. \n About 5 to 6 strides before the pole in the center, bring your horse down to trot, then once it trots over the pole, bend it to the left, push its haunches in with your inside (right) leg, then ask for a canter on the left lead. This is a simple lead change. \n You want your horse to be strong with simple lead changes in one or two trot steps, before you attempt a flying change. \n Once your horse is strong with simple changes with one or two trot steps, you can move on to flying changes. Similar to when you do a simple change, in a flying lead change you want to ask your horse to switch its leads over the pole. \n Younger horses especially may have difficulty with this if they hollow their backs. \n If the horse did not change its canter lead, return to the trot at either A or C and begin again on the next long diagonal. \n The most common reason a flying change will fail is because the horse will misinterpret the aids as an invitation to increase the speed rather than an aid to keep the horse balanced into the hand. \n \n Once your horse is 99 percent correct with its flying changes over the pole, remove the pole. \n When the horse gets the change, continue to canter for a few seconds, then bring it down to a walk and give it its head (for praise). \n 
 To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the cake, set the temperature to 350°F (177°C). and allow it to fully preheat. Next, line the bottom of two 8-inch (20-cm) round cake pans with parchment paper and lightly coat them with butter and flour.You can use nonstick cooking spray instead of the butter to grease the parchment paper if you prefer.\n Add ½ cup (113 g) of softened butter and 1 ¼ cups (250 g) of sugar to a large bowl. Use a handheld electric mixer to beat the two together on medium until the mixture is light and fluffy, which should take 2 to 3 minutes.You can mix the cake batter in a stand mixer if you prefer. \n You can mix the batter by hand, but it will require more time and effort. \n Once the butter and sugar are creamed together, add 3 large eggs to the bowl, one at a time. Completely mix each egg in on medium speed before adding the next.If you prefer, you can use egg substitute in place of the eggs. \n When the eggs are fully incorporated, add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of vanilla extract. Blend it in on medium until it’s fully incorporated., Add 2 cups (250 g) of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons (8 g) of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt to a separate large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully blended.If you prefer a lighter, more airy cake, you can substitute cake flour for the all-purpose flour. \n After you’ve combined the dry ingredients, mix them them into the butter mixture alternately with 1 cup (237 ml) of milk. Beat the mixture on medium-low after each addition until the batter is fully blended.2% or whole milk works best for the cake. \n Once you’ve finished mixing the cake batter, divide it equally between the two prepared pans. Use a rubber spatula to spread the batter evenly throughout the pans., After you’ve poured the batter into the pans, place in the preheated oven. Allow the cakes to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and firm on top.You can be sure that the cakes are finished baking by sticking a cake tester or a toothpick inside the center. It will emerge clean when the cakes are done. \n When the cakes are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Place the pans on a wire cooling rack, and let the cakes cool inside for 10 minutes., After the cakes have cooled for several minutes in the pans, run a butter knife around the sides to loosen the cakes. Carefully turn them out onto the cooling rack, and let them cool completely, which should take approximately 30 minutes.It’s important to cool the cake completely so the frosting doesn’t melt off when you ice the cake. \n Be sure to remove the parchment paper liners if they stick to the bottom of the cakes. \n To get the right consistency for the frosting, it’s important to chill your tools. Place a large bowl and the beaters from your handheld electric mixer in the freezer and allow them to chill for about 15 minutes.If you’re using a stand mixer, place the wire whisk attachment in the freezer with the bowl to chill. \n If you’re mixing the frosting by hand, place a wire whisk in the freezer to chill with the bowl. \n Once the bowl is chilled, add 8 ounces (225 g) of softened cream cheese, 1 cup (125 g) of powdered sugar, and 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of vanilla extract to it. Beat the ingredients together on medium until the mixture is smooth., When the cream cheese mixture is fully blended, gradually add 2 cups (473 ml) of heavy whipping cream to the bowl. Beat the mixture on medium until firm peaks form.Make sure that the cream is extremely cold when you add it to the butter mixture. \n Once the frosting is completely mixed, divide it between three bowls. You’ll leave one bowl white, add blue paste food coloring to a second, and tint the third bowl pink. The amount of frosting in each bowl will depend on whether you’re using icing or candy to reveal the gender of the baby.If you are using icing to reveal the gender, tint 1 ¼ cups (283 g) of frosting blue for a boy or pink for a girl. Tint ¼ cup (57 g) in the other color, and leave the remaining frosting white. \n If you are using candy to reveal the gender, tint ¼ cup (57 g) blue, ¼ cup (57 g) pink, and leave the rest of the frosting white. \n Set one of the cakes on a serving plate, and pipe all along the edge with white frosting. Next, spread 1 cup (226 g) of frosting in blue for a boy or pink for girl inside the circle.If you don’t have a piping bag, you can simply spread some of the white frosting around the edge of the cake with a knife or offset spatula. Using the white border is just to ensure that the colored frosting won’t be visible outside the cake. \n After you’ve covered the top of the first cake with the gender-appropriate frosting and a white border, place the second cake on top. Spread the remaining white frosting all along the top and sides of the cake., Once the cake is fully covered with white frosting, decorate it with the remaining blue and pink frosting. Pipe the colored frosting in dots, flowers, or stars around the cake in whatever design you like.A #8 tip on your piping bag is ideal for adding pearl shapes around the cake. \n A #12 tip on your piping bag is ideal for adding dots to the cake. \n A #4 tip on your piping bag is ideal for writing a message on the cake, such as “It’s a …” \n If you don’t have a piping bag, you can put the frosting in plastic bags, snip off the corner, and pipe simple dots and swirls with it. \n Place one of the finished cakes on a serving plate. Use a large serrated knife to trim off the rounded top of the cake so it’s flat and the second layer can rest evenly on top.To ensure that the frosting won’t get on the serving plate, place several pieces of wax paper beneath the first layer all the way around the cake. If any frosting falls off the cake as you work, it will drop onto the paper, which you can pull away when you’re done icing it so the plate remains clean.. \n After you’ve flattened the first layer of the cake, use a large, round cookie cutter or a tupperware lid to serve as a stencil so you can cut a hole in the center with a knife. Remove the cake for the hole and set it aside.The round item that you use as a stencil should be at least 4-inches (10-cm) in size. \n The cake that you remove from the center hole can serve as a tasty snack for yourself or friends and family. \n Once you’ve removed the cake from the center of the first layer, use some of your white frosting to ice the remaining edge all the way around. Next, use approximately 2 cups (406 g) of pink or blue chocolate candies in the gender-appropriate color to fill the hole.While you want to completely fill the hole with candies, don’t allow them to overflow onto the edge of the cake. \n When the center hole is filled with the candy, set the second cake layer on top of the first. Use the remaining white frosting to cover the top and sides completely., After you’ve covered the entire cake with white frosting, use the pink and blue frosting to garnish the cake. Pipe it on in whatever shapes you like, such as flowers, dots, or stars.If you don’t have a piping bag, you can put the frosting in plastic bags, snip off the corner, and pipe simple dots and swirls with it. \n You can also use blue and pink chocolate candies to decorate the cake. \n 
 If you are as young as 14, some companies will not hire you. Get a job (or at least a paper route).\n Example: Instead of going on a date to dinner and a movie, go for a stroll through the park and have a picnic. (much more romantic anyway) \n Then you won't be pressured to go to the mall or the movies and spend money with them. \n Tell them that you would be much more encouraged to study harder and put more effort into your work if there was a cash reward. Tell them that it is your future, but you are just a kid. Kids need to work hard at school and have fun. If you had a cash reward for good grades, then you could both be happy. \n Seriously. But write down where you hid it. Or tell someone. Then only allow yourself a certain amount of money a month. \n Give yourself more time to save the money. \n Whatever you are good at you can get paid for. You can tutor kids in a subject area you're especially good at: mow lawns, babysit, clean houses, run errands, anything. \n Compare your electric bill to the same month as last year (try to get them to subtract inflation) and see if they'll pay you the balance. Also do dishes, sweep. Keep your room clean. \n Have a friend burn a CD for you or go without. Don't buy extra junk food when you aren't really hungry; wait until you get home to eat. \n For example, if you need a pen, don't buy one that is going to wear out the next day. By the same token, don't buy the most expensive pen out there. \n You may find money still in old wallets or under the bed, or between sofa cushions. \n Also, keep in mind that places such as TJ Max take clothes from name-brand stores and sell them for drastically cheaper than the original price. Thrift stores are also good for hidden treasures. \n If you have some gift cards that you won't use, but know your parents can use them to purchase household cleaning items, discount clothing, etc.,then ask them if they will pay you in cash for whatever is left on the card. This can add up if you have lots of gift cards! The second use of gift cards is to use them. Go through all of your old wallets and take out all of the gift cards you find. Put them on a surface and separate into two piles:wanted and unwanted gift cards. Use the ones you wanted to keep.This will help you save up much extra money. \n Think a penny doesn't count? Think again. Keep all of your spare change in a piggy bank of some form, and when the pig is full take it to your local bank. You'll be surprised at how quickly those loose coins add up. \n The Coin Master takes 8-10 cents per dollar which will really add up! If you originally had $100 worth of coins, then you took it to a coin star machine, it would take ten dollars or more out of your money. To get your change converted to dollar bills, go to a nearby bank and ask for some paper coin rolls. It is actually kind of fun to count all the change by hand. You never know how much it really is, and end up surprising yourself! Be sure to wash your hands when you are done. \n Put all extra money you earn in a piggy bank. You will be surprised at how much it mounts up! \n
 Ideally you should start looking for a university about 18 months before commencement of the course and start applying about a year before commencement. British universities operate on first come, first served basis (more or less) and you do not want to be left out of your favourite course because you did not start looking early enough.\n These are becoming increasingly popular as they require much less commitment. \n Would you prefer to live in a busy city neighbourhood or in a quiet town in the countryside? Apart from its impact on your lifestyle, location will have a huge impact on your cost of living. Cities are generally more expensive than towns, even when you live in university accommodation. London and the southeast are the most expensive. On the other hand, if you would like to have a part-time job while you study, a city will give you more work opportunities. \n Do you prefer to live close to your family and friends or are you the adventurous type? \n Working part-time while you study will help your finances, but it means that you will have less time for socialising or even studying. \n Use Search Engines in education-related websites to find which universities offer your preferred course. \n This can be very important when you are looking for a job after your graduation. \n If you have no qualifications, you can also research educational institutions that accept people with few or no qualifications (e.g. Ruskin College in Oxford, England). \n Do you want a Russell Group University? (Oxford, Cambridge, Warwick, Liverpool, Nottingham, Imperial, Edinburgh etc.) \n This is the only real way to make your mind up about a place. Remember that this is somewhere where you will spend 3 or 4 years of your life. \n Ask about assessments, modules, research interests and university life. \n Find relevant rankings about the University as well as the department you are interested in. \n
 This project is perfect for using up a bit of leftover acrylic in a bright color. Also choose a suitable hook. \n Chain about two and a half to three inches' worth of stitches (7-7.5cm) for whatever yarn and hook you are using, perhaps 20-25 stitches. The length is more important than the number of stitches. The objective is to end up with a tube about an inch in diameter, or maybe a little bit more. \n Do avoid twisting the chain. \n That is, if the loop was about 1 inch (2.5cm) around, you should make it about 1 inch (2.5cm) tall. You're aiming for a rough proportion here, not any specific number of rows. It's all right to join rows, so that this part is a spiral. \n However, do not crochet a turning chain. Each consecutive row will therefore decrease. If you know how to do a single crochet decrease, you can decrease even more. Tie off the colorful yarn, but leave the tails for now. Here again, the exact proportions are not critical. \n Pinch the face together as you go to see how it will look., They'll take a little bit of extra time, but they have a bit more style and a better shape than anything you'll buy in the store. Leave the tails attached on the side of the eyeball and neatly tie off and trim the tails extending from the back. \n Use a large tapestry needle. You will want the face open at this stage so that you can reach inside to stitch the eyes to the inside of the fabric and tie a knot, but you can pinch it closed with your fingers to see where the eyes should go. \n The eyes go very close to the top of the face. They are basically symmetrical, but this is a goofy looking alien, so it's all right if they're a little lopsided. \n Tie the loose ends tightly. You can even tie them to one another. Then trim them close so they don't show through the mouth. \n Make sure all the tails inside are covered up, and tie in and trim any remaining loose ends of the tail. \n You may wish to cut one or two pieces first to get the length right. Four feet (1.2m) is a good length to start with., On the end opposite the face, which is to say the bottom end, put a hook through any loop from the starting chain. Fold one of the cut lengths of yarn in half and grab the middle with your hook. Pull it through. \n This creates a Larks Head knot, as shown in the first four photos under Steps in this article. You should now have two long tails with loose ends. \n Leave your hook in this loop. \n Make them fairly tight stitches; you want them to curl and you won't be crocheting into them. You may even want to use a hook that is a size or two smaller than the one you used for the rest of the body. \n This is one tentacle. Chain a tentacle from the second loose end. Continue adding tentacles all the way around the base of the body. You can also chain the bottom tail from making the initial tube, rather than tying it in. It will camouflage with the rest. \n It helps to make the tentacles all about the same length. You can eyeball it or count the chain stitches in a tentacle you like and do about that many stitches in the other tentacles. \n The tentacles should be longer than the rest of the body is tall, by two to three times. \n Don't do too few tentacles \n Done. \n 
 If a horse steps on a steel-toed boot, the metal in the front could slice into your toes. To protect your feet from a horse possibly stepping on you, choose boots made of firm leather. Soft leather boots, or tennis shoes, won't protect your feet at all. If you are riding, make sure your boots have a heel (usually about 2" high). Don't wear lace up boots. The hooks will get stuck in the stirrups. \n Weight varies widely depending on your horse's size and breed, but typically falls between 880 to 1,870 pounds (400 to 850 kg).Having a quarter of that on your toes is still rather heavy, so take care when choosing safe boots.\n Choose a riding helmet with a retaining harness, and evidence that it's met safety requirements made no more than ten years ago.Look for labels from the SEI (Safety Equipment Institute), American Society for Testing & Materials (ASTM), or Kitemark. \n Some SEI-approved helmets include large ventilation holes that would not pass other tests, due to a possible increase in harm from penetrating injuries. \n Replace the helmet at least once every five years, and whenever it receives a major impact or shows signs of wear. \n Avoid baggy clothing, which can get tangled in the horse's equipment. Most importantly, make sure you are easily visible before riding near roads. Fluorescent vests are recommended, especially during heavy rain, fog, or low light conditions. \n If you are a beginning rider, learning to jump, or entering competitions, wear a body protector. The protector should fit comfortably, be less than five years old, and be approved by a safety standard organization. \n Comfortable gloves and seam-free underwear and legwear can prevent sores and discomfort. \n Anything dangling or removable can startle the horse or catch on his equipment. Take the following precautions: \n Use Peacock Iron Safety Stirrups. The safety stirrups will prevent you from hurting your feet and getting dragged. The stirrups include a break away band. Make sure you have extra bands as they break easily. \n Remove all jewelry. Even tight rings and bracelets can get snagged. \n Tie back loose hair. \n Have non slip stirrup pads, a non slip girth, and a non slip saddle pad. The non slip girth and non slip saddle pad will keep your saddle from slipping. The non slip stirrup pads are designed to keep your feet from slipping while you're riding. \n Wear a jumping vest. The jumping vest will protect your ribs and organs if you fall. \n Safety Cross Ties and a Breakaway Halter are a must. It's just as important for your horse to be safe as it is for you to be safe. You can use baling twine to attach your Safety Cross Ties to your barn. The baling twine will last longer than chains. \n Always ride on a lunge line with a riding buddy to hold the lunge line. The lunge line will allow you to have extra control. This way if something goes wrong you'll be able to get off right away. \n Never ride alone. Riding alone will put you and your horse at risk for getting killed. \n Don't ride at night. It's harder for you to see in the dark. \n No riding in the road. You or your horse could get hit by a car. \n Check the weather before you ride. You don't want to get caught in a storm. It's too risky to ride if it's too hot or too cold. \n Go to the bathroom before you ride. \n Check that all tack is the correct size and shape for the horse. Check all tack for wear and tear. This includes any cracking of stretching of the leather and the quality of the stitching. Anything that is close to breaking or snapping is a safety risk. Check before you mount, then again after riding a short distance. \n The cinch should be tight enough to prevent the horse catching its leg, but not uncomfortably tight. Check again after mounting, after a few minutes of riding, and every few hours afterward during a long ride.You should be able to hold the reins without draping them over the horse's neck, or wrapping them around your hand. \n Keep all tack clean. \n Make sure that you have your stirrups set at the right length. When riding, you should be able to let your weight fall onto your heel. \n During a jump or sudden movement, a neck strap is easier to hold onto than the horse's mane, particularly if the mane is braided. While neck straps are most often used for beginning riders, there is no harm in an additional piece of safety equipment. Nowadays, they are even used by some professionals., Keep at least one of each in your stables, and an extra one in the trailer if your horse is often on the road. Add a sturdy piece of paper with the contact information for a nearby veterinarian, human hospital, and (if possible) horse ambulance.Make sure someone in the area is trained in basic human first aid and equine first aid. \n Check that all gates are closed before you let a horse into a field. Never let your horse loose near dangerous areas, such as roads or areas of treacherous ground. \n Many horses learn how to undo simple latches and sliding bolts. Consider an eye bolt and/or a commercial "horse proof" latch. For very bored or intelligent horses, add additional latches and/or a wooden shelf to block the horse's access to the latch.If your horse is constantly trying to escape, she may need more companionship, exercise, or time spent outdoors. \n Beginners should not be around horses without close supervision. As you grow in confidence and skill, you can handle a horse by yourself, but there should still be people close enough to hear or see if something goes wrong. \n Horses have blind spots directly in front and directly behind. Approach from the side so the horse knows you're coming. \n Even in a small stall, try to get the horse to turn around. If the horse is tied up, approach from an angle, not directly behind.Speak to the horse calmly as you approach, to get the horse's attention. \n Your hands are your primary communication tools with your horse. When grooming or tacking up, rest your hand on the horse's shoulder or hindquarters. This tells the horse you are there even if he cannot see you. It also gives you the best opportunity to push yourself away should the horse choose to kick. As you groom or tack up the horse, stand next to the horse's side with one hand on the horse whenever possible. \n Pay attention to a sudden increase in tension. This may lead to a kick or lunge. \n Tie the rope at the height of the horse's withers (the base of his neck), and make it no longer than your arm.Use a quick release knot so the knot can easily be undone. Never put your finger in the knot as you tie, since the horse could pull it closed. \n Ideally, you should tie the horse to a "panic snap," not directly to a tie ring.The panic snap is a length of twine or string that the horse can easily break with a strong pull. Without a panic strap, the horse may fall if it gets startled, potentially injuring itself or you. \n Never tie the horse using its bridle reins. \n Moving behind a horse makes you vulnerable to a powerful kick. If there is no room to walk outside its kicking range, walk right next to the horse, with one hand on the rump, and keep talking so the horse knows where you are. At this short distance, a kick will have much less force., Moving or standing in front of the horse is safer, but there are still risks. Never duck under the horse's belly (barrel), neck, or tie rope. This is almost guaranteed to spook him as your movement is quick, low and out of his sight. Both actions leave you wide open to being kicked and trampled on. From the front, he is also liable to rear and kick down on you. \n Don’t grab the halter itself, or you could be pulled off your feet when the horse startles. Never coil the rope around your hand or other body part, or let it drag on the ground where it could catch your feet. If this happens, the horse could pull the rope tight and cause major injury. \n Fold the rope back over itself instead to reduce its length. Hold the rope by the middle of the folds, so you can easily drop it. \n Never loop extra lead rope around your hand––your hand can be broken or even taken off if the horse spooks and tries to bolt, or you could be dragged behind the horse. \n Don't get into a pulling contest with a horse. The horse is much stronger than you and could easily pull you off your feet. \n If the horse is very excited, put the food in a bucket instead. It may not be a good idea to feed the horse by hand regularly, as it may encourage nipping., If you need to examine the horse's hoof or leg, let the horse see what’s happening and adjust to it. Put your hand on horse’s shoulder or hindquarter, then move it slowly toward the leg. Squeeze the fetlock gently to get the horse to lift its foot, saying “up” at same time to teach this command.While holding horse’s leg or foot, do not kneel or sit. Squat instead so you can easily jump away. \n Pay attention to other horses nearby, not just the one you’re handling. Don't walk behind other horses, or stand too near their feet. \n In particular, avoid carrying food to the middle of a group of horses. They may crowd around and trap you in their excitement., Training a horse to enter a trailer for the first time can take weeks of patient communication, convincing the horse enter on its own first. Even when handling an experienced horse, make sure to tie or untie the horse with the trailer door closed. This prevents the horse from trying to exit before you are finished. \n Beginning riders should always ride with a more experienced rider, although they do not need to share a horse. Riding in company is also a good idea if you are practicing jumps. \n If a horse is acting wild or full of energy, have an experienced rider lunge (longe) the horse first. \n Speak and behave calmly in the presence of horses. Horses work best with patient, quiet people. Never shout around the horse, as he may spook at the noise. \n Check your surroundings constantly for possible sources of fear. This may include running children, an approaching car, or even a plastic bag blowing in the wind. If the horse's eyes widen and its ears point straight up, it may be scared. If this happens, calmly talk to the horse and try to move somewhere the horse can calm down. \n Desensitize the horse in a familiar setting if it is easily scared. \n Horses are not always friendly when they meet for the first time. Touching their noses together can cause them to bite or strike. \n Let the horse pick the pace when traveling over slippery ground, including ice, snow, and mud. When riding up or down a steep hill, keep the horse to a walking pace, even if it wants to go faster.Sticking to a walk is also a good idea at night or during low-visibility weather. \n When near other riders, either ride abreast or stay far enough apart to avoid kicks. When looking between your horse's ears, you should be able to see the hind hooves of the horse in front of you.That said, when riding with a group, don't allow a horse to lag so far behind it has to gallop to catch up.A red ribbon on the tail is a sign of a kicker in some areas. Stay well back from these horses. \n When at the front of a group, shout back to inform other riders of possible dangers. These include broken glass, poor footing, and branches at head height. \n Losing control of your horse can be a dangerous occurrence, especially if you don't know what to do. In most cases, the safest course of action is to stay on the horse and let it run until it calms down or tires out.Pulling back on the reins can limit the horse's vision and cause it to lose its footing. \n If you practice with the horse beforehand, you can train it to step to one side, slowing it down. Without this training, pulling back on one rein may just limit the horse's vision and balance, or cause it to turn without slowing down.Do not jump off the horse unless it is headed to a road, cliff, or branches too low for you to safely pass under. \n Since both you and the horse are a little more tired after a ride, it's helpful to follow a post-ride checklist to make sure everything gets done. Try this one: \n Slow to a walk before approaching the stable. \n After dismounting, tie the horse with a quick release knot. \n Give the horse a wash and groom. \n Lead the horse back to the pasture or stall. Teach him early on to not rush off, but to stand calmly beside you with the halter on. \n Remove the halter. Pat and praise the horse for calm behavior. He should be able to remain standing by your side until you turn to leave. \n 
\n Are you members of a school organization or club, take or enjoy certain classes or topics? \n Be honest, don't just balk at a something that interests you simply because your friends may not approve or share it with you. \n If you like a certain subject, hobby, special interest or creative outlet that is atypical of your social circle, embrace it. It makes you unique, even if it isn't shared by your friends. \n You may find that you dread a certain class and they do too. Talk about it. \n You'll be shocked how many other interest you share. \n \n They may feel more comfortable alone with you or without their friends around passing judgment. That's fine. It gives you more one on one time to communicate and get to know each other. \n Once you start gaining respect for each other you'll both care less about negative remarks and be more concerned with defending and protecting your new friendship. \n \n You may not know each others music very well at the start, but take the time to learn it. \n Realize that clothing and style may not show much about others' personalities. \n Take the plunge. They may really enjoy knocking ideas and theories around. \n Don't look down on anyone because they are different. \n Put your attention getting personality on the back burner and focus energy on respecting the cultivation of your friendship. \n Why are you hanging out with them?" Be up front, tell them the person is actually interesting and fun to talk to and hang out with. \n If they keep giving you a hard time you should remind them you can keep any friends you'd like and don't need approval. \n Chances are they will respect you for being up front and not give you a hard time once you confirm that you're friends. \n Never deny being someone's friend to save face with your social circle. Not only is it mean, but it's of very poor character. \n Don't force the issue. Even if you don't become great friends now, being cordial and respectful acquaintances is fine. \n Chances are you won't travel in the same social circle even though you become friends. \n \n This happens in friendships. Don't get offended. Just be cool and try to keep the communications open. \n Accept when a real friendship may not develop. You may just not be cut out for it with that person. Hopefully, you've met some of their friends and the lines of friendship are open elsewhere. \n \n Just because you're from one group doesn't mean you can't date someone from another group. There are many who find the differences and a genuine friendship based on deeper connections more rewarding and successful than dating someone within their immediate circle of friends. \n Don't assume they won't like you. Assume they will. \n 
 If you don't have a large room, your garage will do nicely.\n You want to light the blue or green background evenly with your lights set at a 45° angle from the screen. The lights should be far enough back so they don't cause hot spots. \n Your talent should be lit by the third light in such a manner so there is no shadow cast upon the background. \n This will be used to get a "clean" key with the software later. \n If you are going to use live audio, have a good lavaliere microphone attached to the talent's clothing, far enough away from the talent so that breathing is not captured on mic. \n Note: A DVD camcorder must have the video transferred to the hard drive in another manner. \n Ultra allows you to auto key or manually key. Generally, with adequate lighting, auto key works fine. \n On TV, they are using the weather maps as the background coming from the PC. \n This is done because video coming from a camcorder will create a large file. A rough rule of thumb is that ten minutes of video equates to 2gb of hard drive space. The Codec (compress-decompress) used will reduce the size of the file depending on the Codec used. Be aware, there is no free lunch. When you compress, you are leaving something out so your quality is being reduced, though there are loss-less codecs available. \n This could take some time depending on the length of the video and the speed of your computer and the resolution you have selected. \n You could also use Microsoft Movie-maker that is a part of Windows but it is fairly basic in its capabilities. \n In the editor, you can delete or rearrange the scenes as you see fit. \n You can also add background audio as well as titles and credits. Special effects software is also available that will let you create such things as lightning, explosions, and other special effects. \n In one afternoon, you can tape yourself in front of the Sphinx. the Taj Mahal and a beach in the south of France, all without leaving your 10' x 12' computer room. \n 
 "Confide in Jehovah for ever; for in Jah, Jehovah, is the Rock of Ages." (Isaiah 26:4)The name of Jesus means "Yahweh-saves" which is the same as "Yehoshua," "Jehovah-saves." wikipedia:Jehoshua Name Jesus is the Lord, the Savior and the "Word made Flesh", ie: Jehovah lives...: \n "The Lord lives; and blessed be my Rock; and exalted be God -- the rock of my salvation!" (2 Samuel 22:47)Jesus Christ is "...the spiritual rock that rock was Christ." (1 Corinthians 10:4) \n Some answer: "I'm a ____________..." (name a denomination or church). That is not the question. \n Going to the garage or barn doesn't make you a car or a horse. Just going to church can not make you Christian... Symbols and gestures cannot make you a Christian. \n Self-righteousness is about judging, doing, acting and going to their kind of Christian church and doing their traditions, but not crediting it all to God, and His grace and forgiveness which is available to all who are penitent/repentant. \n \n Anger turning to hate against wrong doers may be understandable, but God's grace can save the worst. Pray for help and confess hate and anger that lingers for days... "Don't let the sun go down on your anger." -- try to make it right (be penitent yourself), and forgive the repentant. \n Jesus said: "The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock." (Matthew 7:25) , For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you." (Luke 6:38), "By this you all know that you are my disciples: if you love one another." (John 13:35) \n If the grace and the love of God is your boast then you will not be judging or boasting about your goodness... \n "But I will never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. By his cross my relationship to the world and its relationship to me have been crucified ." (Galatians 6:14) , (1 Corinthians 3:11) , You can improve your plans and your building as needed after inspections, according to your faith: Jesus said, "For John came to you to call you to righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax-collectors and the harlots had faith in him: and you, when you saw it, neither regretted your sins, nor believed him." (Matthew 21:32) \n Be penitent. Repent - means be willing to change, and try if you need to change your ways (and perhaps pay back people you had wronged then do so as you can...) -- then God's Spirit will help you by the Word and will direct your pathway by the "Bible" with guidance of God's Holy Spirit and by His people (church). "I say to you, 'Except you repent (change), you shall all likewise perish'." (Luke 13:5)Be penitent as that is needed, but know that you can not barter for or pay for your soul's salvation or for His grace. Both are free, but then you do the work for others but not to impress anyone including yourself. Be contrite. \n "Study to show yourself to God as an approved workman that need not be ashamed, and who rightly handles the word of Truth." (2 Timothy 2:15), Be humble in dealing with others. \n 'One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me (the Rock)'" (Mark 10:21), ""Jesus (the rock) said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me'..."" (John 14:6), (Proverbs 11:30), Here is a metaphor or a simile: "I (The Rock) am the vine and you are the branches. Remain in me (The Rock), and I will remain in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself -- that is, if it does not continue in the vine -- so neither can you if you do not continue in me (The Rock)..." (John 15:4)I chose you to bear fruit (in the cleft of the Rock; I am in you and you're in the Rock of Ages.): \n "You did not choose me, but I chose you and you to go and bear fruit--fruit that will last... " (John 5:16), I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full." (Matthew 6:5), I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but wait in the city of Jerusalem, until you are endued with power from on high." (Luke 24:49), "Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means..." (2 Corinthians 8:11 ), "LORD, you establish peace for us; all that we have accomplished you have done for us." (Isaiah 26:12), Hang around with people who are into following God's will, but not being controlling; not judging everyone harshly. "Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange doctrines, but gaining inner strength from God's kindness is good for us..." (Hebrews 13:9), Invest in your friends, your spouse, in children and in your charity in the community to help the less fortunate to find their way -- \n (Luke 6:48)
 Starpoints are awarded based on how involved you are. If you save lots of album pages, you will get lots of Starpoints. They are also awarded if you comment on other's pages, make sceneries, and join clubs. \n This is not mandatory, but veteran users have realized that you earn Starpoints easier and rack them up quicker when you support Stardoll. $5.95 for 1 month will give you access to lots of places around Stardoll and will let you buy lots of exclusive things for Superstars only.

 The better the grapes, the better the jelly. It doesn't matter if they are seeded or seedless, green, white or red. That said, seeded grapes usually have a stronger flavor, and the majority of jellies are made with red or Concord grapes.You can also use 5 cups of grape juice in a pinch. \n You should have roughly five lbs of grapes to work with. \n If you plan on canning all the jelly yourself, start preparing the cans now. \n If you need a little extra to make sure that you have the berries covered, use it. \n Raise the heat and put the cover on, letting the berries boil for ten minutes. Every few minutes give everything a nice big stir. \n Put about 2 cups at a time into the bag and let the juice drain. The jelly bag will collect the pulp, skin, and any seeds while the juice that you will use for the jelly drains out. You should have about 5 cups of juice at the end of this process. \n Squeeze the juice through the bag with clean hands or by pressing it gently with a spoon. Empty and discard the pulp periodically if the juice is draining too slowly. Rinse the bag if needed. \n If you don't have a jelly bag, try forcing it through a mesh strainer lined with cheese cloth., Get a vigorous, rolling boiling going for about a minute before moving on to the next step.. \n Keep the boil going for a quick, hard minute, stirring constantly. \n Move quickly here -- you want the jelly to chill in the jars, not in the pot. Get the foam off with a slotted spoon and move on. \n For a little different flavor, consider adding 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice here, giving your final jelly a bit of tangy-ness., This is why preparing the jars ahead of time is so essential. By letting the mixture cool out in the open, you open the possibility that the jelly will crystallize and turn to a chunky, unappetizing mixture. \n Leave roughly 1/4 of an inch between the top of the jar and your fill line., Canning requires you to heat the jars (after the are filled with jelly) to sterilize them and preserve the fruit. You should have your hot water bath boiling at the same time as you jelly.The following method will help you if you do not have dedicated canning equipment. However, getting a canning set is almost always easier than using a homemade water bath.\n This allows you to work efficiently, as opposed to rushing around as the jelly finishes. If you don't have a dishwasher with a sterilize setting, wash them with soap and water. Then boil the jars for 10 minutes, leaving them in the water until you're ready to use them. The lids should be kept in hot (but not boiling) water for 5-10 minutes. \n The jars need to be hot when you pour in the jelly, otherwise they may crack. \n Canning jars have a lid and a ring. The lid needs to have an unbroken rubber seal along the outside edge, and these can only be used once for canning. The rims screw on top of the lid to close the jar completely. \n If you live above 1,000 feet above sea level, let them cook for the full ten minutes. Try to keep at least two inches of water above the top of the cans to speed up the process. Also, make sure that you have a tool capable of safely remove the hot cans from the boiling water before you begin. \n If you live above 6,000ft above sea level, you should let the jars boil for closer to 15 minutes., Place the jars in a cool place (not the refrigerator -- that's too cold) and let them cool back to room temperature. After 1-2 hours, when they don't burn you when touched, loosen the rims on the jars a half turn or so to prevent it from rusting or sticking onto the jar. \n It shouldn't easily pop up and down, and shouldn't make a noise when pushed. If it does then you don't have the jar completely sealed, and the preserves will quickly spoil if you're not careful. Properly preserved jelly should last up to 12 months. \n 
 Before you spend time with this relative, take a few moments and decide how you want to behave.Perhaps you and this relative have gotten into arguments in the past. Ask yourself what started these arguments and if there are ways to avoid getting into an argument this time. \n You may be proud to be Atheist, but your Aunt may truly believe that being Atheist will land you in hell. It may be best to avoid talking about religious beliefs when around your Aunt.\n Take a breath before you speak. If you’re having a hard time holding back negative comments, gently excuse yourself. \n Say, “Excuse me. I’m going to go use the bathroom” or “I’m going to see if any help is needed in the kitchen.” \n That way, if you get cornered into a discussion or argument you want to leave, you can signal for a rescue. \n You can agree on a sign ahead of time if you may need a rescue at a family function. For instance, you can make eye contact and give a hand signal that means, “Please help me escape this situation!” \n You don’t have to dread going to family functions because of a family member. Put your focus on spending time with the family you enjoy and doing activities you find fun. Even if the family member you hate is in the room, focus on other things. If you find yourself in a conversation with this relative, find a distraction to help you get through the interaction (like playing with the dog). \n If you fear sitting next to the relative during meals, suggest making name cards and sitting far from this person. \n One way to deal with a difficult relative is to give this person a job or a task at family gatherings. If a meal is being made, ask the relative to chop onions or set the table, and let him or her do it the way he or she wants.That way, the relative will feel like he or she is making a contribution, and will be out of the way for a bit. \n Find ways to include this relative yet also keep this person busy. \n Especially if the situation is tense or uncomfortable, you can use humor to disarm difficult behavior and bring some lightness to the situation.Make a casual comment that shows you aren’t taking yourself or the situation too seriously. \n If your grandmother keeps telling you to put on a sweater, say, “I should go grab a sweater for the cat, too; I wouldn’t want her to be cold, either!” \n You may have a friend call you (or you call a friend) with an “emergency”, or you can say the house alarm system is going off, or that your pet is ill. Whatever you find plausible, arm yourself with a potential excuse if you’re feeling uncomfortable or angry with your relative. \n If your uncle loves to bring up politics but you’d rather not discuss it, don’t engage the conversation.Make an effort not to bring up politics when in this family setting. Even if your uncle brings it up and tries to egg you on, it’s up to you how you respond. This goes for competing sports teams, universities, or cousin rivalries. \n Say, “We can agree to disagree and leave it at that” or “I’d really rather not get into that here and I’d prefer to have a great family gathering without this argument again.” \n If your grandfather says something offensive, ask yourself whether your comment will alter his perception or if it will spark a debate. \n Sometimes you have to grit your teeth and say, “You’re entitled to your opinion.” \n If you can’t stand your relative due to a conflict, see if you can resolve the conflict between you and your relative. You may need to find time to sit down, be honest with each other, and clear the air. When approaching your relative, be kind, compassionate, and non-defensive.The sooner you resolve conflicts, the less resentment will build up. \n Be willing to forgive.You don’t have to ignore the situation or pretend it didn’t happen, but learn to forgive so that you can release the hurt in pain from within yourself. \n), don’t be afraid to say no. Remember that you have the right to say “no”. If you want to consider things before you immediately say “yes”, you also have the right to wait and think things over before you agree to anything. \n You don’t have to justify your response or give an excuse. Just say, “I’m sorry, I’m unable to do that.” You don’t owe anyone an explanation. \n Perhaps your difficulties arise because of certain passive aggressive remarks from your relative comparing you to other grandchildren or nieces and nephews (“Well, Jason got into the university but you did great going to community college”). You may even feel manipulated by your relative by passive aggressive remarks or actions. If your relative is passive aggressive toward you, keep your distance as much as possible and don’t interact more than you have to; remember that it’s not about you and it’s not personal.If you feel like you are being manipulated, find an exit strategy from the conversation (“I’m going to see if any help is needed in the kitchen” or “I’m going to go play with my nephews, I haven’t seen them for so long!”). Don’t engage the conversation. \n If you struggle to enforce family boundaries with relatives, firmly let them know that family rules apply at all times. If you don’t like how a relative treats your child (like bossing the child around or feeding foods that are unhealthy), let this relative know that the behavior goes against family rules, and family rules are enforced in and outside the home. \n Be upfront and matter-of-fact when discussing this with your relative. Say, “Allison isn’t allowed to play that game at home, and she’s not allowed to play it here, either.” \n If a relative has done something unforgivable, enforce whatever boundaries allow you to feel safe. If that means not inviting this relative to family functions, fully avoiding him or her, or letting the family know that relationship is severed is up to you. Put the focus on feeling safe, and not on punishing the family member. \n Use your best judgment in telling other family members the situation. Keep in mind that while you feel the situation is unforgivable, your family may not feel the same way and continue a relationship with this family member. \n While you may want your distance from your family member for your safety, realize that estrangement can be really hurtful, both to you and your family members., If you know you’ll be spending the day with a relative you dislike, make sure you come into the situation as prepared as possible. If this person brings out an aggressive or testy side of you, make sure you get a good night’s sleep the night before. If you’re feeling tired and grumpy at the family Christmas party, leave early. And make sure you’ve eaten, too: if your blood sugar is stable, you’re less likely to become angry or aggressive., If someone belittles you, talks down to you, or says mean things to you, it’s important to remember that this is more a reflection of the person than it is of you.Stand firm and remember who you are. Do your best to tune out the words, and remind yourself, “This is not about me. This is my aunt’s projection.” \n People are often mean because they have their own personal issues they are dealing with. This can happen when people have low self esteem, anger issues, or stress. \n Other people might act a certain way and truly believe it is okay and normal. This can be caused by a number of factors, but one example might be a person who lets their competitive and cutthroat business style seep into their personal life. \n Some individuals simply don't have the biological tools needed to feel empathy. This may be brought about by genetic differences or by the way someone was brought up (i.e., the environment they grew up in)., There’s likely nothing you can do to change the person whom you don’t get along. You may have a fantasy of a happy family celebrating every holiday together, and when this relative comes, it crushes that fantasy. It’s up to you to drop this fantasy and accept that this is the family you have, and that fantasy is nothing more than a happy and nice thought that’s not based in reality., Instead of approaching this relative in judgment and disgust, practice being accepting and empathic. Listen when your relative talks and try to understand this person’s point of view.Practice loving compassion for this person. Take a deep breath and look at your relative. Then think, “I see you, and I see that you suffer and are in pain. I don’t understand your pain, but I see that it is there and I accept that it affects me for the time being.”, Maybe you’re excited to see your nieces and nephews, or happy you get to cook (or not cook). \n Find things to be grateful for even before you arrive to the family function. That way you can go into the situation already feeling thankful. \n If you have a hard time moving past the hurt and pain the relative has caused, you may benefit from therapy. A therapist can help you work through feelings, find coping mechanisms, see things from a different perspective, and help you work through underlying feelings of depression, anxiety, or other diagnoses.You may also consider family therapy if you wish to engage your relative in therapy with you. While it may be difficult, it can help you confront difficult topics and discuss them with your relative. \n

 You will want to wear clothes that will not restrict your movements or blood flow. Don’t wear clothes which are too tight, especially around your joints. You will also want to wear clothing which is made of a material which breathes well, since you will sweat when doing many forms of exercise. Clothes specifically designed for exercise can easily be found.\n Just because we call them tennis shoes does not mean they are great athletic shoes. Shoes like Converse have little shock absorbency and can be terrible for your feet and bones. Get shoes which fit comfortably and are designed for the type of activity that you intend to do. \n Drink lots of water before you exercise. Your body will need the water to help your muscles work and also to help you sweat. If you’re dehydrated before you start, just think about how you’ll feel afterwards! \n Don’t stretch before exercising. Contrary to popular belief, studies have shown that this is not helpful and will not allow you to perform any better. If anything, stretching before exercising will make you worse off: it’s a great way to pull or strain a muscle and hurt yourself! \n Though researchers cannot agree definitively on whether or not warm ups help you to perform better in exercises, they all agree that warming up certainly won’t hurt.Warm up before exercising by doing a less intense version of your intended workout for 5-10 minutes. If you plan to run, jog first. If you intend to swim, swim slowly. \n Certain conditions may make it a good idea to check with your doctor before starting an exercise regimen. There are exercises for every health condition, but it’s a good idea to know what to avoid. Exercising should make you feel healthy and good in your own body: not hurt you! \n If you have diseases or conditions like asthma or lung problems, arthritis, diabetes or liver and kidney problems, or heart disease, definitely talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.If you notice certain problems, you will also want to talk to a doctor. These include things like pain or dizziness following physical exertion, shortness of breath after very mild exertion or when at rest, or swelling in the ankles. \n You may also want to talk to a doctor simply to find out what kind of exercise they recommend for your particular goals and health conditions. You can also consult with a nutritionist and a trainer for more information on exercising and how you can best meet your goals. \n Aerobic exercise is often called a “cardio” workout, since it is designed to increase and improve blood flow. These types of exercises are of a lower intensity but last for longer periods of time. \n Climbing stairs is a great way to get your heart rate up. You can climb actual stairs or you can use a stair machine at a gym. Climbing stairs improves your leg muscles as well as your butt. Be careful if using actual stairs, however, as you do not want to fall and get seriously injured.  \n This is not just a fun game for children but also an excellent workout. Working the arms, legs and core muscles, this is an exercise that you can easily do at home. It is also well known for improving balance and is excellent for people who intend to play sports. \n Jumping jacks are an exercise performed by standing with the legs together, arms at your side, and then jumping to move the legs outward and raising the arm together above your head. Jump again to return to the starting position. These are great for getting your heart rate up and burning calories. \n Walking and jogging are wonderful ways to get your heart rate up. Though jogging may be difficult on the knees for some people, walking is certainly an accessible exercise and should be done by those at every level. Studies have shown that walking an hour a day can help you maintain your weight over time and reduce your likelihood of certain conditions, like hypertension and obesity. , Swimming is great exercise and is fun to boot. This will work different muscles depending on the style of swimming you do. Swimming is frequently recommended for people with joint problems or those that are significantly overweight, as it can take a great deal of strain off of the skeleton while still raising the heart rate. \n Riding your bike is an accessible, environmentally friendly, and very effective way to get exercise. Working muscles in most areas of the body, bike riding will get your heart rate up while it gets you somewhere! You can bike outside or you can get a stationary bike and stay at home. \n Anaerobic exercises are those done at a higher intensity for shorter periods of time. These build strength and help your body to become accommodated to working hard. Paired with a healthy diet, these exercises can also help you to lose weight, as your body’s caloric use will increase. These types of exercise are actually arguably better for burning fat than aerobic exercises. , Running is tough on the knees and bone structure but is still an excellent form of exercise. You can run locally around your neighborhood or around a track at a gym. Remember that running is different than jogging: it’s much faster and much harder to do! \n There are many different types of weights you can lift and ways to lift them, but doing this type of exercise will help you build a variety of muscles and increase your strength. Be sure to start small and work your way up, since trying to lift something which is too heavy is a common way to injure yourself. \n Push ups are done by placing yourself with your stomach on the ground. Place your feet so that your toes are flat on the ground, then place your hands flat on the ground at face level, a shoulder’s width apart. Then, keeping the line of your back and legs completely straight, lift your body with your arms by pushing against the ground so that your whole body is supported on your toes and hands. Lower yourself back down so that your nose is nearly touching the ground and then raise yourself back up. Repeat. \n Squats are done by standing with your feet a shoulder’s width apart, back straight, arms crossed in front of you, and slowly lowering yourself down as if to sit in a chair. Once in the sitting position, slowly raise yourself back up. These are a great exercise for your core and leg muscles. \n Burpees (a common military exercise) are done starting in a standing position, then drop to a crouch, jump the legs back into push-up position, do one push-up (if you want), hop your legs back to the crouch position, and then jump straight upwards with hands raised to return to the standing position. This is a great workout as it exercises all areas of the body. \n Core workouts develop the muscles around your abdomen. This has many benefits. With a stronger core, you will be less prone to back pain and injury and you will also be able to improve bad posture. Paired with weight loss, strong core muscles will also give you defined abs. \n Planks are probably the most efficient core exercise. You can greatly improve your core strength with just a few minutes of this exercise every day. Planks are done by taking a position similar to a push up, but supporting the upper half of your body on your forearms and holding the position for as long as possible. It will surprise you how difficult it is if you’ve never tried it but the exercise is extremely effective. \n Crunches are another great core exercise, done by lying face up, knees bent, arms crossed at your chest, and lifting just the head and shoulder up towards the pelvis. Lower yourself back down and repeat. \n Sit ups are similar to crunches and are done by lying face up, knees bent only slightly, and rolling your upper body into a sitting position. You can cross your arms in front of you or run your palms up and down your thighs as you move to guide your movement. \n Bridges are a great core exercise because they also work on your bottom and lower back muscles. These are done by lying on your back, with your knees bent and your arms flat on the ground at your sides. Slowly roll your back and lift your hips until a straight line is created between your shoulders and knees, your back and thighs parallel, and then slowly lower it back into starting position. \n T’ai chi is a Chinese martial art, the forms of which are done in sequences of slow movements. Doing t’ai chi will allow you to build better balance but it can also be very relaxing. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home. \n Weight shifts are a great starting balancing exercise. These are done by standing with both feet on the ground, hip width apart. Next, shift all of your weight onto one leg and lift the other slightly off of the floor. Hold the position, trying to maintain good form, for 30 seconds. Do the other leg. Repeat as much as you want. , These are done same as the above, with the exception that the lifted leg is bent backwards at the knee. This will work on your front-to-back balance, whereas the previous one focuses more on side-to-side. Both should be used in conjunction. \n Pilates is a series of forms and movements which occasionally makes use of tools like exercise balls, weights, and resistance bands. This form of exercise helps train muscles with the correct movement patterns which can improve balance, core strength, posture and flexibility. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home. \n Yoga is an Indian meditation technique and exercise which has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety (in turn aiding weight loss) and is excellent for building better balance and flexibility. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home. \n Various forms of dance, such as ballet, are actually fairly rigorous exercise and can significantly improve your flexibility, as well as your coordination. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. \n Stretches should be done after warming up or exercising, as this will help prevent muscle strain and injury. Stretching your muscles will help provide much greater flexibility and can reduce the likelihood of injury due to strain during other exercises later on.A basic stretch to try is a hamstring stretch. This is done by sitting, splaying your legs apart, and reaching forward to touch one foot at a time. You can bend the leg which is not being reached across. \n Another basic stretch is a butterfly groin stretch. This is done by sitting on the floor and pulling both ankles in towards your crotch, getting as close as you can. Try to press your knees to the floor as you do this. \n Try a simple shoulder stretch. This is done by pulling your elbow across the front of your body towards the opposite shoulder. Press against your arm as you do this. \n This wall stretch aids mobility in the chest, shoulders, abs, hip flexors, quads and calves. Face a wall standing about a foot away from it, then reach your hands up as high as you can flat against the wall, leaning forward into it with your chest and hips while keeping your feet in position flat on the floor. \n You don’t have to dedicate hours of your day to exercising. Anything helps, so find ways to fit exercise into the smaller “in between” moments of your day. You can do squats while you wait for food to cook or microwave or fit in a minute of planks when you first wake up. Look and you will find moments in your day to get a little more active. \n If you spend most of your day sitting in a desk chair, you will find you have a lot to gain from finding an alternative. Using a standing desk or a standing desk in combination with a treadmill will get you burning calories while you work (it doesn’t even have to be fast paced, though the harder it is the more you’ll get out of it). If that’s not for you, try an exercise ball instead of a desk chair. Some research has found that using these methods can help you lose over 40 lbs a year if you’re overweight. , When getting to your apartment or office, skip the elevator and take the stairs instead. This is great because you can add a floor at a time as it becomes easier for you to get up the stairs. Eventually you can also run up the stairs for some added exercise. \n Whenever you can, stop using your car if it is possible for you to get yourself where you’re going on foot or on a bike. Turn grocery shopping into a workout by walking to the store a few times a week to pick up a smaller number of items. Take a bus to work and get off a few stops early to walk. Ride your bike to work if you can. If you have to take your car, park really far away from your building. This is a great way to introduce physical activity into your day. , This can be broken up into three 10 minute sets. \n If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets. \n This will obviously need to be broken up. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for a few seconds, and then return. \n If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets. \n Sit in a chair, stand up and repeat. You can try doing these squats without the chair if you have the strength and balance to do so., This can be broken up into two half-hour sets. \n If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets. \n This will obviously need to be broken up. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for 30 seconds, and then return. \n If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets., This can be broken up into three 5 minute sets. \n This can be broken up into two half-hour sets. \n If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets. \n At this point you need to work in variations like the side plank and reverse plank as well. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for a minute, and then return., You will want to choose weights and positions based on the muscle groups you wish to focus on. Break up the hour into three 20 minute sets and try to work different muscle groups in each set., This can be broken up into three 10 minute sets. \n Interval training is any exercise done at a very high intensity for only a few brief minutes (2-3 at most) and alternated with either no activity or a slow paced activity. Interval training is widely regarded to be one of the most effective exercise regimens, since it is less time consuming but appears to produce identical effects., The most basic interval training routine would be to sprint for 2-3 blocks (or the equivalent of 400 meters) and then walk back to the starting point, beginning the process over again. \n An alternative would be to combine this with an aerobic workout. Warm up by walking slowly for five minutes, quickly for ten minutes, sprint for three blocks, walk back two block, sprint for three blocks, walk back two blocks (and so on, lasting 15 minutes), and then walking back quickly to your origin point to cool down. \n You can apply interval training to almost any exercise activity. Try cycling, swimming, many core exercises, and so on. Try to alternate between exercise activities on different days to ensure that all of your muscle groups get attention. \n You will want to set your goal for exercising at least ½ an hour a day. Slowly, over time, you should draw this out to 1 hour. This time period, however, can be broken up into sections and spread over the course of the day, however, those sections should be no less than 10 minutes. When you begin, exercise at least 2 days a week. Over time you should increase your frequency up to 5 days a week., Walking is the best thing you can do for improving your health. As discussed above, a study found that a mixture of intense and relaxed walking in senior citizens decreased the likelihood of certain diseases by 20%. You can walk with your friends, family members, or by yourself. If you want to walk in the comfort of indoors, you can walk around the inside of your apartment building or you can walk the inner corridor of the local mall. You can also walk outside if you prefer. \n Try to walk for at least half an hour a day and go at a pace that gets your heart rate up. If you do not push your body at least a little, you will not gain nearly as much from the exercise. \n As we age, we tend to lose a lot of our balance. This is normal. However, you will want to work on your balance to help ensure that you can move around without hurting yourself. Do balance exercises to protect yourself and prevent injury.A good, basic balance exercise is to try standing on one leg. Make sure to do both legs in turn and to also have a chair nearby to hold on to if necessary to prevent falling. \n Muscles lose their elasticity over time, which can make it difficult for you to move around or get up if you fall. Do flexibility exercises like stretches to maintain your muscles and keep you safe and independent. , Lift small, 2lb weights (more if you can). This will help you maintain the strength in your hands and arms, allowing you greater independence for longer. \n Cool down exercises, like warm up exercises, are a gentler exercise, meant to ease your body between working hard and being at rest. Cool down by walking for 5-10 minutes and (preferably) stretching. Stretching before exercising is likely to cause injury but stretching after exercise, when the muscles are warm and active, will help improve their tone and flexibility., When you exercise, your muscles use up and your body sweats out a number of essential nutrients. You need to replace these nutrients or you can hurt yourself or become sick. These nutrients, water, sodium, potassium, and sugar, can be consumed in a number of ways. You could try drinking water and eating a banana or drinking water and eating a protein bar, among a variety of other options. If you choose to drink a sports drink, it is best to dilute the drink at a ration of 6 to 1 (that is 6 parts water for each part drink) since these drink's sugar content is unnecessarily high. \n Exercising, especially the kind that pushes your body beyond its comfort level (the good kind!), can cause muscle pain and discomfort. This is normal and a healthy sign of your body getting into shape and becoming stronger. You may want to manage the pain though. This can be done by taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen or using an ice pack.Intense pain with a fast onset is an indication that you have injured yourself. Consult with a doctor or nurse, especially if it is very severe or lasts for more than a few days. \n Prevent muscle pain to begin with by slowly easing into exercise, both in an individual routine but also over the course of time. Don’t leap straight into a high intensity program but rather build yourself up to that level over the course of several months. \n 
 It should be on the top section of the cockpit panel.\n on it's below it going to determine the heading for landing and also help for manual ILS approach. \n In the NAV 1 standby input the ILS freq to the box and press the switch in between the active and standby NAV 1 frequency to switch between those freq (ILS frequency could be found in the map > click airport runway > scroll to the bottom to see the runway heading ILS freq and type of runway. also insert the runway heading into the NAV OR CRS box in the autopilot panel). \n Press the IAS hold button (better known as IAS button) and the APP or APR hold button when there already a sound of continuous beep. \n Turn off the auto pilot and control the plane manually into the runway. Also press F1 to idle the engine. \n This is the challenging part. Now with no auto pilot or anything you have to control the last 10 second to touchdown manually. Make adjustment as necessary. Don't turn too hard, or the plane will go off course. \n Press and hold the F2 button to activate the reverser. Reverser will help the plane to stop. \n
 You will need to be rested and your patience gauge must be full. Don't expect to do observing in the same night you start collimation if your telescope is way out of alignment, otherwise you'll rush things.\n Remember: a LITTLE hole. You can do it using a pointed scissor. Put it into the eyepiece. \n You realize it needs collimation if you don't see the entire secondary mirror through the collimation cap and if you don't see the three locks over the primary mirror (the concave one, in the back of the scope). \n So don't mess around with it unless you're certain of its misalignment! You may need to collimate the secondary if you bought the scope second hand or if you have already messed up with it. \n Place a colored paper behind the secondary mirror, inside the tube of the telescope. For this step, you'll need to open your scope. \n WARNING: keep your scope in a horizontal position, so the secondary mirror won't fall on the primary. \n Now you need the center the reflection of the primary mirror in the secondary. Still using your homemade collimation cap, screw one of the three secondary screws, and start screwing the other two gradually until you see the three locks over the primary mirror. These locks are 120° apart from themselves, so they're easy to spot. \n It is a little easier then the secondary. Most new telescopes come with the exact center of the primary already marked, but if yours is not marked, you can do it by simply sticking a round piece of white paper in the exact center (take your time doing it: it must be the EXACT dead center). It won't trouble your observing as long as your piece of paper is smaller then the secondary mirror's diameter. I recommend using a piece of paper with half inch diameter (or 1 cm). \n Use the screws under the primary to do that. In most telescopes there are six screws, grouped in pairs. In this pair, one them is a locking screw, and the other is the adjusting one. Take your time to learn how they move the mirror. \n If your telescope has what we call a "secondary offset", the spider may be off center in the final results. But don't be bothered by that if the reflection of your eye is centered. \n You may stop the collimation process here. But if you want to observe the planets in the Solar System and binary stars, you NEED to do a fine tuning in your collimation, in a process called "star test". \n People in the Southern Hemisphere are not as fortunate, because finding a stationary star is way more difficult for them. But worry not: be smart! You can use any bright dot-sized light source to do the fine tuning, like antennae or far (really far) away street lights. This way you can do the fine tuning in cloudy nights and the light source is absolutely stationary. The results are the same. \n Use your highest magnification lens. Focus it. Now continue gradually rotating the focusing knob until you see a pattern that resembles a target (it may be off center) or a Doppler-effect illustration. If your scope is way out of fine alignment, you won't see this effect. But any slight over-focus will do the trick. \n Use the screws in the back of the primary mirror to do that. Be aware that your light source will MOVE A LOT and go out of view. Keep track of where it goes so you can find it again. This process may take a few hours of trial and error, but it is rewarding. \n No need to buy a 50$ piece of plastic or an abhorrently expensive laser collimator (even this laser may need collimation!). \n 
 There are five basic types. All require periodic inspection and can need maintenance to fix any punctures, tears, cracks or cuts. They are all in rolls of 1 yard (91.44 cm), or in 1 meter width (39.4 inches) except for Single-ply Membrane which come folded: \n Built-up Roofing: This method, known simply as BUR, is done by overlapping rolls of treated felt using hot (molten) tar or asphalt. It becomes brittle and cracks up over the years. \n Single-Ply Membrane Roofs: This type is excellent but requires propane torch heat to install the seams. The membrane may be injured, cut, etc. and with only the one layer that can be problematic. \n Sprayed Polyurethane Foam: This kind of roofing material is sprayed, or squeegeed flowed onto the surface and may be protected by a special second coating. \n Modified Bitumen (Asphalt) Roll Roofing: This is a method in which a single layer of asphalt-treated, granule coated felt is cold cement sealed or hot sealed to the primed decking or to a base sheet. \n "SA" Self-adhesive (SBS, APP or modified bitumen) rolls: These often include (1) both an SA base sheet and the SA cap sheet, both come in rolls -- or (2) only a single cap layer is applied to a primed decking. (The material has a split backing where after a length of it is rolled-out and aligned, then half the backing is pealed off and that half smoothed down; next the other half of backing is peeled and smoothed down as well.) \n Different roof types require different materials. The amount of each material depends on the surface area of the roof. \n Use a special scraper, square nose spade or shovel, or such to loosen the old roofing material., Check for and repair low areas because they will not drain well. The roof rafters are like joists; there is not much pitch, or incline, and they may warp and sag. Repair any sagging rafters and decking to prevent ponding/standing water. Some roofs have drains, such as having walls around the roof and have drains to be keep cleared and intact. \n Can't strips should have 2 45 degree cuts and be fitted into inside corners of the roof surface. The felt used in BUR cannot bend at right angles. The can't strips help ameliorate the problem. \n It is made of paper, polyester OR fiberglass saturated with asphalt. It is set down with a 2 to 4 inch (5 to 10 cm) seam, or overlap, between sheets. \n Fasten the sheets with special (large, thin-headed) roofing nails (in appropriate length for your process and thickness of deck or sheathing), spaced about 8 inches (20.32 cm) apart along the overlapped edges and staggered 12 inches (30.48 cm) apart elsewhere ("in the field"). The edge of roof nailing of roofing (if required) is staggered (to not split deck) close, 2 inch (~ 5 cm) spacing. \n Cut the base sheet to fit around vents in the roof and lay it over the can't strips. \n Flashes are material you apply around vents and other areas to prevent water damage. You can further protect the roof from water damage by applying plastic roofing cement at these sites. \n There are several types of felt you can use to replace your roof. Most are either coal-tar or asphalt saturated paper or fiberglass fibers (all may be called fabric or felt). The felt material comes in rolls that are 36 inches (91.44 cm) or 1M (39.4 inches) wide. \n Read labels. Consider the type of roof and climate before choosing the felt and the asphalt, tar or other roof cement so that you select the correct types for your roofing process.\n Asphalt works to seal the asphalt-saturated felt to make the roof waterproof. \n Mop and lay another strip 12 inches (30.48 cm) wide, over the first such strip, forming a double thick, starter edge-seam. \n Mop full width felt over that double thick 12 inch starter across the roof. \n \n Keep the asphalt at optimum temperature as the roll is unrolled onto the mopped, hot, liquid asphalt little by little. It is important to immediately roll felt paper into it to ensure effectiveness, as that hot liquid is the adhesive, and becomes less liquid and finally solidifies as it cools. \n You can repeat the entire process of laying the asphalt saturated felt and mopping each layer with hot asphalt 3, 4 or up to 5 layers over the entire roof. \n To do this, give the roof a heavy final coating of hot asphalt and then cover the entire surface with crushed-granite aggregate. The covering protects the roof from the effects of the sun, and helps protect the roof from objects such as fallen limbs. \n Alternative covering: Sometimes the BUR roof is topped by spraying or rolling on a silver colored, metallic aluminum, asphaltic "paint". \n Another alternative: White elastomeric (rubbery) plastic coating may be used to cover the BUR. \n

 Although few articles do exist of some theme parks, if you type in the theme park's name into the green search bar at the top of any wikiHow page, you can generally get to see if your given topic has already been written or not. If the search results come up with a list of articles, you'll need to compare your topic idea to the articles there to see if any of them meet the requirements for a duplicate title as the one you are proposing and to ensure your topic you began isn't deemed to be something that will one day need to be merged to prevent duplicate information in two different articles according to our Merge Policy. \n Make sure to use the term "Visit" as part of the how-to title as written on this site at the very front of the title followed by the theme park name. If the theme park has more than one branch (such as Six Flags and similar), you'll need to add in it's name after the theme park name. If there are still several notable differences of multiple choices, you'll need to finish this title off with "in" and the city name in which this theme park itself is based., You'll need to know whether or not the park has several sections (or lands) throughout the park, the park has lands that are untitled but tend to be split into their own groups, or if the park is spread sporadically around a bunch of ungrouped lands focused around one or two soul footpaths with buildings on either side. \n If the park has titled lands, you'll more likely to need to use the wikiHow Advanced Editor or Article Creation tool so you can establish the subsections of steps, so that each land can be portrayed accurately, and so that the reader doesn't lose their focus because it looked confusing to read to them. This will be described more in a few steps from here, so be prepared. \n If the park has untitled lands, you'll more than likely need to designate some type of system to explain to the reader the direction of travel when the reader would be walking and how they'd come upon it. If the attraction is at the borderline between two untitled lands, you'll need to mention something along the lines of "If you've reached (attraction name in second title), you've walked too far or reached into the next land" upon the last attraction in the lands' section. \n If you do not like (or do not understand) wiki-text languages, you can use the Article Creation Tool. However, using this will make the flow seem to go awful slow and you'll end up giving up a whole lot sooner. \n If the park doesn't have titled lands or has no visible lands but a few soul footpaths, you can use the Guided Editor to begin your article, but you'll still have some work to do to establish a great article otherwise. Guided Editor will help form some of the wiki-text to form the items you talk about into Steps. \n For most of these articles, you won't need to add substeps (of your main Steps) and many sub-tips of Tips which some users find difficult to understand the syntax of. \n Although this will depend on how you want to get into the article and how your settings run, most users will want to click the "Write an Article" button from any page of wikiHow which will send you to this page where you'll have to input your proposed title. This is a double-check step to ensure none of the top five (5) articles match what the article calls for as a duplicate. Type your title based on our Title Policy and click "Get Started" then click the "None of these are exactly the same as How to (title)" and click "Write My Article"., The Article Creation tool, as was stated earlier can help, but you can also send the article to be written in the Advanced Editor from there, or you can deselect this option in the preferences page and write them from Guided Editor and switch between Advanced and Guided on the fly. For those who know front-end wiki syntax very well, you can (and should) use the Advanced editor and go from there, but each article's information will vary widely., The introduction of the article is the first place that will establish the first form of communication to get your reader psyched into visiting the park. However, it isn't there to spoil the user's vacation to the park or describe just what the article is bound to do. Shoot for three to four sentences for an introduction, as part of a paragraph to psych the reader to get them ready to read the remainder of the article., Although park maps will differ, park maps with all rides and attractions should be enough to formulate a good article that is ready to be researched. Experience in the particular park you are planning to write about is definitely a plus, but giving the reader the ability to see just how much there is to do in the park, makes for one excellent article - even if you feel that the ride was rather lame, let the others know that when they arrive at the step that they might want to either not ride or take things in stride or to skip the ride at all. (Even other shows and attractions should be written as their own step.), Anything that makes this attraction unique is a strong point to write down about the attraction and include in the Step inside the article. Either research the ride on Flickr (for static images) or YouTube (most widely-used researching choice for videos) to see just what each ride is like. With so many users on YouTube filming their on-ride POV videos (and even some with off-ride videos), you'll need to know just what the user should expect to encounter on their ride. \n Even if you've been to the park before, make sure you see spots where others might have recorded that show things others were thinking to see where your reader might not understand if given the article inside the park. Try to expand on others' mistakes from their filming and explain their wrongdoings. \n (Search using the exact ride name along with the theme park's name as well as a trigger word using "on-ride" or "off-ride" (or sometimes even the trigger abbreviation "POV") as these videos can take either of these two forms when searching. If the search returns no results (or few/unrelated results), omit these trigger words altogether and try again. If this still produces none, you'll need to rely on other sources of information such as from this theme parks website which could list information about their rides. \n For show attractions however, neither terms "on-ride/off-ride" nor "POV" are ever used, so do your research without these triggers behind as your search term. \n (i.e. Scrambler rides can be formed into Scramble, as well as shows being either Watch or Take in.). Try not to use the action verbs "Go" or "Ride" as they can be considered vague and the reader might not be in an understanding with those steps set that way or need to further question what to expect when they get there and will tend to venture away to find more information that you should have researched already. As you work through the park, focus on gathering an action verb to describe what the ride does, what types of scenery it provides and how the two elements interact to provide for a great ride experience and describe. Even if you have never ridden the ride or watched the attraction before, get to know exactly what all attractions are like., Make sure the reader understands some of the other theme park options of nearby theme parks that could be around or within a comfortable (30-90 minute) driving distance or in case they don't want to go to this park once they arrive), as well as noting the address of the park (which you'll need to cite where you reputably obtained the park address/contact info from). \n Google has information, but you'll have to really deep-down delve to really understand where it's getting it's information. Bing has it set up so that once asked, the engine will give you your answers then relay you to the website it found the information from then send you to other possible search results if you still didn't find the information you were looking for. \n But, please read on, as it's not all about those few steps to visit the park. \n Discuss the parking situation. Although you don't need to grab directions from a nearby landmark like most websites mention (since everyone is coming from different places), you might want to discuss whether the park's parking options include an open lot or some sort of enclosed parking garage. If you can find the parking spot's exact address located online somewhere, provide an address as close as you can to the parking garage as well as it's price for a general 2-to-4 axle car. If you can't, provide it's nearest cross-streets nearest the entrance to the parking area. \n Although this should really be written by typing from a real-life perspective of what you'd find (as if you were the reader looking for these answers yourself), if you do enough research on your topic, this will take you a small amount of time - if you know just where to look for your answers. \n If you have enough citable information as to the parking lot section names (few theme parks websites and apps list this information), provide these names and cite your source as to where you found these names. Don't just say that you found the list on (name major website here) and send the reader searching for answers or looking to prove your information to be inaccurate - no! - that doesn't tell the reader exactly where this information can be found and will more than likely send your reader looking elsewhere to gather the information they need on another website or competitors website (if one exists). \n Explain the entrance, or if the walkway to the entrance has something memorable that all readers will encounter when entering (that sets this park separate from the others), mention it! Again, best done by real-life instances that people know of, but could be done sometimes via looking at YouTube videos and Flickr images. Explain to your reader what the turnstile entrance entails - but not to the point where you'll be describing how the crank get's turned or the direction your entrance card gets you in (readers can already assume how these items work or can ask for help if needed when they arrive to that point). You can explain some of the signage on top of the entrance gates or even the theming of the paint scheme surrounding the turnstiles or similar ticket booths to let them know what they should be looking for to get them in. \n Go the extra mile to get the reader psyched to know just what to expect when they get to the park. Even if the entrance of one ride and another is on opposite sides, as long as you group them together of nearby attractions, you can easily keep your reader thrilled and want to understand the step well enough. \n Establish subsections of where the lands begin and end as the reader would walk through them. Set Steps up by themed land as with each land set as it's own subsection of the Steps top-level section of the article; Even if you can't read it or can't understand the best pattern of where the exits and entrances are - at least the readers can get a general idea of where the attractions are for themselves and can easily look to find the exact entrance pattern as they enter the park (of if they still can't find the item's entrance, can ask a nearby employee for help who should be able to give them better directions). \n If you have an article that needs to be written that you have subsections for and don't know wiki-formatting all that well, rather write the article as is and leave out the subsection title headers and go back and add the subsections following these guidelines later using Guided or Advanced Editor formatting. \n Parks not divided into individual lands can be set up as if the reader walks from one end of the park on one side to the back end of the park then coming back around and back to the main intersection where the turnstiles are. \n For each remaining step that you set up, make sure they have information for each attraction - ride or show - that the park has. Although you want to avoid spoilers as much as genuinely possible, you can mention that there are certain areas that can't be missed and describe areas nearby the area that these rides show that this information could almost spoilers of, so the people don't miss them. Describe the ride or attraction using an action verb at the front. (Remember, some nouns can become verbs, but you'll want to catch yourself from using the better action verbs (by doing researching on the potential verb alone at first) to ensure the word can become a verb on it's own.) \n Just because some attractions aren't too famous, doesn't mean that it shouldn't be included. (Outside of food vendors) all attractions should be explained in some respect inside the article. (i.e. In SeaWorld parks, although roller coasters similar to Manta and the like are very popular, there are also rather minor attractions such as dolphin shows and the famous Shamu show along with Otter shows and tanks where different types of fish can be watched by the visitors that most people who write these types of articles often miss that really make the article informative.) \n If you still need help describing the attraction, inside some theme parks, you can sometimes find theme-park fanatics who will go out and record rides and post them on YouTube as front-seat/on-ride POV videos (as was described before). \n If the park has any special fireworks or special daytime or nighttime parades, give them details into some of the parks' parades. Provide the location of the entrance point of the park and exit point and general parade route, if you have that information easily accessible. \n If you have watched a recent showing of the parade and noticed a really great spot that was never crowded, provide this viewing spot referencing nearby attractions and from what side of the walking path you were on. \n Don't concern yourself on special fireworks or activities that only happen on select days. (i.e. While most readers will want information on the fireworks shows at the Disney parks (but these articles have been covered already), once you get into talking about the slight variations of Christmas and Halloween versions of the shows and their tweaks, you'll have lost your audience.) \n At the very least, some great tips that fly well include well-sourced Tips about the date which this particular park opened (Grand Opening). Some of this information can be found and sourced from Wikipedia's information for the park. Other ideas to include can include these ideas. \n Tips \n When 4-8 year old kids get antsy in this park and it seems like your day is lagging behind, give these kids some options. Even though this park has a few areas where kids can explore and run out all their excitement, this may sometimes not be enough. If you haul around a double-seat stroller, and warnings just don't work, give them time in the stroller. If they don't fit, you'll need to find some other way to draw out their energy. They will thank you for helping them "take a load off their feet". These youngsters tend to draw energy out more quickly, and become cranky quicker. \n Keep kids (under age 5) on "leashes" (arm straps) at all times. Don't allow your kids to remove them at any time. It's hard to see your kids leashed up like a pet, but with the large amounts of guests in the park at any time, security is of utmost importance, and their leashes will help immensely. Don't even remove them, when your kids are in their stroller, as it can take only a few seconds for the kid to get out and become missing (the leashes only would allow the child to go so far as you'd allow them to go). \n Warnings \n Always ride the ride with safety in mind. Use all safety devices the ride operator provided for you and your family. \n Rides occasionally close and change at this park. Don't fear if your favorite ride has changed or has become defunct. Something will be there to replace it over time. Their replacements might be just as good as the ride you once loved. \n Everybody's tastes are different. You can skip some rides if you don't have time or if the kids act up. Some kids might be too churlish to some rides, while other rides might be too intense for the younger crowd, so you may want to skip these rides. \n Although all Disneyland and Disney World (USA)-based park Visit guides here have already been started as well as a few of the other named parks, categorize most of the Visit articles in Category:Carnivals Circuses and Theme Parks via either of these methods (dependant on your wiki-editor you are using). If you are using the Article Creation Tool, you will have to publish without a category and add it using the Guided Editor that is just as easy to use as the Article Creation Tool when editing an article; and which you'll find towards the bottom of the tool., Turn on the "Sources and Citations" section (for those who have had to cite their sources) in Guided Editor (check the "Sources and Citations" section towards the bottom of the page and publish) or if you are able to use the Advanced Editor, set up the "Sources and Citations" section and place the {{reflist}} template on the article in this section. If you are working from the Article Creation Tool, you must skip this and add this step's publication information manually from the Guided or Advanced Editors. Not doing so at any point of citing, will create cite (citation) errors which cause reader confusion. \n If you have other research/reference sources that are citable based on wikiHow's External Links policy, provide those in this section as well. Forego any eHow or About.com links as these are competitors websites which have been known to be from farm systems that can sometimes be unsuitable to be referenced on articles here due to those editors being paid to write their articles which can sometimes cause major gaps or inaccuracies \n Don't just say that the information is from a "personal experience"! If there was a webpage that gave you the idea to create it (besides this article) and this link doesn't violate this policy, provide it in this section with the notable words "ideas from" provided in the same line along with the website that gave you the ideas. (i.e. "* ideas from (link URL here) ") \n If you are using the Article Creation tool, you won't have this feature, however, once you publish and use the Guided or Advanced Editor, you can add Step-by-Step pictures in the article. \n The Flickr tab in the Guided or Advanced Editor can be a lifesaver for most of people when they are in trouble, it can sometimes run you into trouble if the theme park isn't well-known or well photographed (such as theme parks outside of the United States/Canada and some theme parks in Europe). Flickr tends to see people photographing rides from the outside (and sometimes inside) of famous (or can become famous later) rides. Include photos that have the main entrance (or close to main entrance) as the photo you'll use, but make sure the photo is specific to that specific park's entrance. \n Use the Local file tab to use pictures you yourself took of the ride. Click the "Add Image to Steps" button in Guided Editor or by clicking the add pictures button (which looks like a portrait of a mountain with a plus sign in the right hand corner of the portrait) on the tiny toolbar of icons at the top of the Advanced Editor (if you've chosen to utilize it for subsections) and utilizing the pictures under the "Flickr" tab and add the photo that way. \n Although the Article Creation tool won't give you a place to explain what you are doing (and will automatically populate a field inside of the edits that need to be patrolled with this information), with the Guided and Advanced Editors, you'll need to add in an edit summary such as "created new article" or similar. Sometimes there will be another box that will help you populate these fields once you begin typing, but this helper object won't display unless you create them in the Guided Editor., Scroll down the page until you see the line of buttons and click the Publish button. It may take a few extra seconds for the article to compile and ask if you like what you see, but you can easily select Publish if you have all the necessary things this article has described here. If you aren't done with the initial publishing edit during this session, you can click the "Save draft" button.
 Be sure to keep this up to date and do weekly full scans and updates.\n This will allow your computer to automatically download any updates to both the operating system (i.e. Windows) and Internet Explorer. These updates fix security holes in both pieces of software. \n To further reduce the possibility of getting a virus or similar please read the following advice:, Here are 2 scenarios: \n You get an Email from someone you DON'T know. You open it. It tells you (or, persuades you) to click on a link in the Email. You do so. That is when you get infected. Frequently, the Email appears to be from a bank or a company you know. Do not fall for this. Businesses do not normally send unsolicited Email. \n You get (what appears to be) an Email from someone you DO know. Unknown to you, a virus generated that Email (and not your friend). It could be that your friend's computer is infected, but, not always. Obviously, the actual Email writer doesn't know you and cannot say anything personal to you, so, typically, it says something like "Click on this link for some important information... “. You are now infected. \n The same caution should be used with opening links and attachments as Emails. \n In addition, do not download software or “Add-ons” from web sites that you are unfamiliar with. This includes sites such as “Facebook” and “MySpace”. \n Of course, you can run a virus scan on it first, but Anti-Virus programs are not 100% effective. \n This includes torrents or other forms of P2P activities (Limewire for example). Staying away from these sites and programs is in your computer's health's best interest, as well as a good way to avoid being sued for copyright violation. \n 
 Pack the essentials: undergarments, shoes, a set or two of regular clothes, entertainment, medication and, for longer flights, basic toiletries. Some people fly as if they may never see their luggage again – and that has some merit. Keep in your carry-on the minimum of what you need to survive should you lose your luggage. \n Make sure to take all your medication and everything you need to be comfortable. Prescription and non-prescription medication are allowed. It’s easier to get extra liquids through security if they’re medically needed, like with saline solution. \n In order to cut down on the amount of clothes to pack, choose items that are interchangeable. Stick to a few items that all go together, rather than completely separate outfits. Use accessories to spice up an outfit. For example, scarves are small and easy to pack, and can be used as a scarf, headband, or even a belt. \n Take your swimsuit if you are travelling by air, put it with in your vacation gear, especially if you are a woman. If your bags are lost when travelling by air, most items (such as shorts or T-shirts) can usually be purchased at your destination. However, if your bags are lost, swimsuits for women can be hard to shop for. If you do not have your swimsuit you may miss out on the beach, hot tub, or other vacation fun. \n \n Anything valuable should come with you in your carry-on. On the off-chance your luggage gets lost or damaged, your carry on should not leave your possession. If you'd be heartbroken if you lost it, take it in your carry-on if you take it at all. \n Pack large electronics last, so they are easily accessible. You will not need to go digging around when time is of the essence. \n \n The TSA requires electronics to be screened – when they are all in the same place and easy for the agents to see, you won’t be the one holding up the line at security. \n In order to get on the plane, you need identification, such as a passport or driver’s license. Do not forget your ATM card and credit card or AAA card. However, it is probably a good idea NOT to take every piece of plastic you own because you run the risk of losing the cards. \n In an easily accessible pocket of your carry-on luggage, store your flight information: the airline, the flight number, your confirmation code, and the flight details. This comes in handy at the self-service check-in kiosks that so many airlines provide now at the airport. \n You may not need to pack much, if any. Your Aunt Maria probably has shampoo, for instance, and Peru will likely have toothpaste. It may take an extra stop at a store on your travels, but by avoiding tons of bottles, lotions, and tubes, you save space for other, more important things. \n If you do bring toiletries, in the United States the 3-1-1 TSA regulations still applies. You can fill as many 3 oz bottles of toiletries (100 ml) as you want into ‘’one’’ quart-size plastic ziplock bag (limit one per flyer), but you have to take out the bag at security screening.Go to www.tsa.gov for the full rules and regulations. \n Sometimes flights can cause headaches, so have a pack ready just in case this happens to be that one. A few things you may want to pack: \n Painkillers \n Bandages \n A sedative (if you are a nervous traveler) \n Anti-nausea medication \n Chewing gum (for air pressure changes) \n Tissues \n Earplugs (good for travel in general) \n Medication for anything you are prone to, such as allergies. \n Remember you are not charged for the clothes you wear traveling, so dress with that in mind. Dress in layers so you can bring more with you. Instead of a T-shirt and jacket, wear a T-shirt under a long sleeved top under a sweatshirt, for example. Wear your hiking shoes and pack your flip-flops, especially when you are travelling for business., You can manage, which err n traveling by air, for a three month work trip, without checking any bags if you really want to. Checking luggage, for some, is a pain in the rear. You have to worry about packing it, dragging it with you, meeting weight requirements, likely paying extra fees that you did not know about, and then hoping the airlines do not lose it. If you are traveling for less than two weeks, consider it. It may be a challenge, but it is doable. \n Flight attendants and crew do it all the time. They can go over a week with just a carry on.If they can do it, so can you. You can then use the extra $50, if applicable, for whatever you please. \n In addition to meeting the weight requirements, it’s just easier to pack lighter – fewer things may get lost (via flying or when you leave them in your hotel room), it is a lighter bag to tote around, and you'll have plenty of room for souvenirs and impulse buys. And it'll take less time to repack. \n Though you should hold off on bringing too many shoes, you have to bring some. Shoe should be packed in plastic bags to avoid soiling your others goods unless they are brand new. Also, consider packing socks in your shoes rather than waste space. \n Just in case something were to happen to your carry on, you forget to pack your carry-on correctly, or something unfortunate happens on your trip, put copies of important documents in your checked luggage. Scan your passport, visa, and anything else that you may need in the worst of circumstances. If you do it, you won’t need it. But if you don’t, you may. \n If you are bringing toiletries with you, it is likely something will leak. Each item should be wrapped separately and stored in bags to make sure none of it gets on your clothes. Keep these in a separate area in your bag, too. \n Take the lid off of each bottle and plastic wrap the top; then put the lid back on. This means that even if the lid opens, you should still be fine., If you are not already rolling your clothes, get on the bandwagon. It prevents awkward square-shaped wrinkles and it saves room, so hop to it. Start with the heavier ones on bottom as lighter ones are generally more moldable to the shape of the top of your bag. \n The tighter the roll, the more room you save. Even a little more compression here and there goes a long way. \n Some airports are courteous enough to provide plastic bags for you, but if yours is not one of those, take them yourself. They are always useful, especially if you are traveling in a group – someone always forgets. And this way if your first round bags get soiled, you have a backup. \n The zipper kind – the kind that literally has a zipper on it. The resealable ones are better than the non-sealable kind, but the zipper kind are best – the resealable kind can open when force is applied. \n High-quality zip-lock bags can also be used to pack your bag tighter. You can sometimes get to 1/3 more room if your clothing is put in zip-lock bags, the air forced out, then sealed. It can also protect clothing from getting soaked in outdoor adventures and keep your dirty underwear away from your clean clothes. \n To get the most out of your bag, you’ve gotta pack it according to shape and size of your items. Start with the biggest, heaviest items on bottom and work your way up to the light items – this will make it easier to close your bag when all is said and done. If something is an odd shape, pack clothes around it – make it a point to never pack air. \n In general, it's easier to back long, cylindrical items than odd shaped bottles and containers. In the future, to streamline your packing look for items that are of more basic shapes and sizes. They take up less room overall. \n If you are planning to shop at fashionable Parisian boutiques on your travels, do not stuff your suitcase full of ordinary clothes. Leave room for your purchases in your bags., In some cases, it may be easier to ship your items by mail or by a service like FedEx or UPS. This may be very important if you are going on an extended trip or need special equipment, like winter camping gear., Your trip destination will determine the kinds of things to pack, and the length will determine how much of each item is to be packed. What days do you have special events planned? How can you use the same pieces over and over? \n If you can, try to avoid needing a checked bag. More and more airlines are charging for that first checked bag, and a cheap flight can turn into an expensive one in a matter of no time. If flight attendants can live out of a carry-on for over a week at a time, so can you. \n Checking before packing can help pinpoint what you really need. For example, Vermont typically has mild summers, but also has "heat waves" that can make it semi-tropical. Checking the weather will let you know if you really need to pack that tank top or that umbrella. \n Take a small amount of multipurpose items to deal with the climate of your vacation destination. For instance, one waterproof windbreaker takes less space than a raincoat and a jacket. \n If you’re going to a different country or overseas, odds are certain things will be different. Will you need an electronics adapter? \n You may not be able to bring your Saudi host a bottle of wine, for example. Or take certain kinds of plant seeds to Australia.
 Are you speaking? Are there any unresolved feelings? Will you likely get back together in a month's time?\n We are most interested in personal anger/hate, trust, honesty and need. \n Are there any items which may result in a disagreement? \n Decide on a method that is likely to be noticed, don't write a letter if you think it may be torn up. Remember that they may not want to answer your calls while they get over you. \n Did you get a reply (if the contact was written?) If not, wait as long as you can, (but not too long, especially if the return of your property is urgent), and politely request some attention to resolve your property concerns. Contact people who are in regular contact with your ex, and ask for them to make an approach for you. \n Use all the numbers and email addresses you have for your ex. Send a text message offering to help make a clean break. Say you only want items that you absolutely need, and then you'll be out of their hair. Ask for no more than the return of your clear property. \n Offer to go to arbitration (informal or formal) to resolve the outstanding property issues. State that you need your stuff and are still interested in a companionable solution to the problem. \n

 This game really requires more than about 10 people to play per team, that's why its commonly played at schools.\n A level floor playing surface is adequate enough, however, more often this game is played in a large gymnasium or other large open area where it is deemed acceptable to play a game similar to kickball. \n Although you can use whatever "base" you'd like to use,as long as it's large enough for all the players to stand on the bases at the same time. The bases themselves tend to be gymnasium mats (thereby the reason why this game is called Matball). \n Crossing that imaginary line makes the kicking player automatically safe. Most often times, this imaginary line is centered at the direct center of the area of the gymnasium floor - all so that the kicking player can have room to take action on the ball when it arrives. \n The kicker can either kick the ball and begin running the bases, or they let it slide past and into whatever is behind them. However, the outcome of missing this ball can be deemed to be either an out or just a miss, but must be based solely on the umpire or other officials officiating the game. \n They can either run to the right (much like the current game of baseball) or towards the left and run from base to base until they reach home. \n You can have many players on one single mat. \n Sometimes, game officials give the teams an ultimatum when they reach base, in hopes that they are not called "out" at any time (outs are discussed a little later). They can continue running in hopes not to get stopped by any one baseball fielder near the mat, or they can stop and safely rest on the mat. \n Recognize what should happen in the case the player oversteps a base (even by just one foot). Most often times the game official gives players the opportunity to lead with their one lead foot, however, they must not come off the base or they can be thrown out to be considered "out". Most often times, once you leave a base, you can't return again to that same base. \n Games vary from location to location and include (but are not limited to) these two universally-accepted rules. \n If the ball is kicked behind home plate, it is considered to be a foul ball. \n If the ball hits the ceiling of the location traveling forward, it is either a foul or out (dependent on location rules). \n An out for a player is recorded when either the player has swung their leg and missed on several attempted kicks or when they swing and kick but the fielder catches with their hands, when the running player gets tagged while running the bases or during an altercation in the game that causes the out. \n If the location's doors are open in front of home plate and the ball heads out the doors, some places consider the ball to be live at all times until the fielding team retrieves it, or it may be considered a home run. Sometimes if the game is played indoors inside a gymnasium and there are basketball hoops that have been raised and the ball travels into or through the baskets, it's an automatic home run, but that's only a general advisement and not a required idea to determine. \n Recognize that there are more scenarios than what are posed here, but vary widely upon each individual situation the location encounters. \n Sometimes, interference can be called in the field when some members of the fielding team are playing their position in or near the basepath and/or to a certain extent so that the running player must collide with them to get to their next base. If this error is recorded, the player can safely be marked as safe on the next base, and the player who committed the error must sit out until the next inning or till the end of the game and can't be up to bat unless these players are elementary school age and are just learning the game. \n Sometimes, as long as theirs a ball in play and their is a runner on a base (or is running the bases) these teammates can continue running the bases. However, if you want, you can tell the teams that they have to stop after (x) amount of runs. \n After several outs have been recorded by the kicking team, the side is out. If all players reach base without leaving any other players behind, you may end up waiting for someone to make a mistake and have all players leave their bases, but that won't happen very often. \n Repeat this play after the two teams switch places (the kicking teams becomes the fielding team and the fielding team becomes the kicking team). \n The team at the end of a few rounds or the one to record the most runs will win and the game will be over. \n
 Such physicians are known as haematologists. \n Their routine work mainly includes the care and treatment of patients with haematological diseases, although some may also work at the haematology laboratory viewing blood films and bone marrow slides under the microscope, interpreting various haematological test results. \n In some institutions, haematologists also manage the haematology laboratory. \n Physicians who work in haematology laboratories, and most commonly manage them, are pathologists specialized in the diagnosis of haematological diseases, referred to as haematopathologists. \n Haematologists and haematopathologists generally work in conjunction to formulate a diagnosis and deliver the most appropriate therapy if needed.\n Haematologists may specialise further or have special interests, for example in: \n bleeding disorders such as haemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura \n haematological malignacies such as lymphoma and leukemia (onco haematology) \n haemoglobinopathies \n the science of blood transfusion and the work of a blood bank \n bone marrow and stem cell transplantation \n Only some blood disorders can be cured. \n Haematological analysis involves the determination of different blood parameters, which can be done using either the electronic quantification or the manual quantification. \n The electronic quantification can be done with the use of the auto counter and these displace about 15 parameters, while the manual quantification of PCV for example, is by the use of the Micro haematocrit centrifuge. This Micro haematocrit centrifuge is used to determine the Packed Cell Volume (PCV), from which many other parameters can be obtained. \n The best way to determine blood parameters is through the electronic device called auto counter because it gives accurate values and manual red blood cell counting is obsolete and inaccurate Although, the manual quantification is also used to confirm whether the values obtained from the auto counter correlate with it for PCV. \n The haematocrit (Ht or HCT) or packed cell volume (PCV) or erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF) is the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells. It is normally about 46% for men and 38% for women. It is considered an integral part of a person's complete blood count results, along with hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, and platelet count. \n The term "haematocrit" was coined in 1903. Its roots stem from the Greek words hema- blood, and krites, judge - meaning to gauge or judge the blood.In mammals, haematocrit is independent of body size. The PCV of animals can also be determined, to know their anaemic state. \n Elevated haematocrit - In cases of dengue fever a high haematocrit is a danger sign of an increased risk of dengue shock syndrome. \n Polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative disorder in which the bone marrow produces excessive numbers of red cells, is associated with elevated haematocrit. \n Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other pulmonary conditions associated with hypoxia may elicit an increased production of red blood cells. This increase is mediated by the increased levels of erythropoietin by the kidneys in response to hypoxia. \n Professional athletes' haematocrit levels are measured as part of tests for blood doping or Erythropoietin (EPO) use; the level of haematocrit in a blood sample is compared with the long-term level for that athlete (to allow for individual variations in haematocrit level), and against an absolute permitted maximum (which is based on maximum expected levels within the population, and the haematocrit level which causes increased risk of blood clots resulting in strokes or heart attacks). \n If a patient is dehydrated, the haematocrit may be elevated. Repeat testing after adequate hydration therapy will usually result in a more reliable result. \n Lowered haematocrit - Lowered haematocrit can imply significant hemorrhage (for example, in an ectopic pregnancy). \n The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and the red cell distribution width (RDW) can be quite helpful in evaluating a lower-than-normal haematocrit, because it can help the clinician determine whether blood loss is chronic or acute. The MCV is the size of the red cells and the RDW is a relative measure of the variation in size of the red cell population. A low haematocrit with a low MCV with a normal RDW suggests a chronic iron-deficient erythropoiesis, but a high RDW suggests a blood loss that is more acute, such as a hemorrhage. \n They include: \n Infants who may not have adequate iron intake \n Children going through a rapid growth spurt, during which the iron available cannot keep up with the demands for a growing red cell mass \n Women in childbearing years who have an excessive need for iron because of blood loss during menstruation \n Pregnant women, in whom the growing fetus creates a high demand for iron. \n Patients with chronic kidney disease, as their kidneys no longer secrete sufficient levels of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production by the bone marrow. \n This is the main oxygen transport protein in the fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until the neonate (newborn child) is roughly 6 months old. Functionally, fetal haemoglobin differs most from adult haemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream. \n In newborns, fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult haemoglobin by approximately the twelfth week of postnatal life. In adults, fetal haemoglobin production can be reactivated pharmacologically, which is useful in the treatment of such diseases as sickle-cell disease. \n Foetal haemoglobin, (also hemoglobin F or HbF) is the main oxygen transport protein in the fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until the neonate (newborn child) is roughly 6 months old. Functionally, fetal haemoglobin differs most from adult haemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream. \n In newborns, fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult haemoglobin by approximately the twelfth week of postnatal life. In adults, fetal haemoglobin production can be reactivated pharmacologically, which is useful in the treatment of such diseases as sickle-cell disease. \n When fetal haemoglobin production is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult haemoglobin (HbA). Children with sickle-cell disease instead begin producing a defective form of haemoglobin called haemoglobin S. This variety of haemoglobin aggregates, forming filaments that cause red blood cells to change their shape from round to sickle-shaped, which have a greater tendency to stack on top of one another and crowd blood vessels. These invariably lead to so-called painful vaso-occlusive episodes, which are a hallmark of the disease. \n If fetal haemoglobin remains the predominant form of haemoglobin after birth, however, the number of painful episodes decreases in patients with sickle-cell disease. Hydroxyurea promotes the production of fetal hemoglobin and can be used to treat individuals with sickle-cell disease. Combination therapy with hydroxyurea and recombinant erythropoietin—rather than treatment with hydroxyurea alone have been shown to further elevate haemoglobin F levels and to promote the development of HbF-containing F-cells. \n This refers to the process of determining the genotype of an individual by the use of electrophoresis. Current methods of doing this include PCR, DNA sequencing, ASO probes, and hybridization to DNA micro-arrays or beads. The technology is important in clinical research for the investigation of disease-associated genes. \n Due to current technological limitations, almost all genotyping is partial. That is, only a small fraction of an individual’s genotype is determined. This experiment actually only determines the phenotype, not genotype. \n Experiments with blood transfusions, the transfer of blood or blood components into a person's blood stream, have been carried out for hundreds of years. Many patients have died and it was not until 1901, when the Austrian Karl Landsteiner discovered human blood groups, that blood transfusions became safer. \n Mixing blood from two individuals can lead to blood clumping or agglutination. The clumped red cells can crack and cause toxic reactions. This can have fatal consequences. Karl Landsteiner discovered that blood clumping was an immunological reaction which occurs when the receiver of a blood transfusion has antibodies against the donor blood cells. \n Karl Landsteiner's work made it possible to determine blood groups and thus paved the way for blood transfusions to be carried out safely. For this discovery he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. \n An adult human has about 4–6 liters (1.6 US gal) of blood circulating in the body. Among other things, blood transports oxygen to various parts of the body. Blood consists of several types of cells floating around in a fluid called plasma. The red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds oxygen. Red blood cells transport oxygen to, and remove carbon dioxide from, the body tissues. The white blood cells fight infection. The platelets help the blood to clot, if you get a wound for example. The plasma contains salts and various kinds of proteins. \n The differences in human blood are due to the presence or absence of certain protein molecules called antigens and antibodies. The antigens are located on the surface of the red blood cells and the antibodies are in the blood plasma. Individuals have different types and combinations of these molecules. The blood group you belong to depends on what you have inherited from your parents. \n There are more than 20 genetically determined blood group systems known today, but the AB0 and Rh systems are the most important ones used for blood transfusions. Not all blood groups are compatible with each other. Mixing incompatible blood groups leads to blood clumping or agglutination, which is dangerous for individuals. Nobel Laureate Karl Landsteiner was involved in the discovery of both the AB0 and Rh blood groups: \n ABO blood grouping system - According to the AB0 blood group system there are four different kinds of blood groups: A, B, AB or 0 (null). \n Blood group A - If you belong to the blood group A, you have A antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and B antibodies in your blood plasma. \n Blood group B - If you belong to the blood group B, you have B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and A antibodies in your blood plasma. \n Blood group AB - If you belong to the blood group AB, you have both A and B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and no A or B antibodies at all in your blood plasma. \n Blood group 0 - If you belong to the blood group 0 (null), you have neither A or B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells but you have both A and B antibodies in your blood plasma. \n Rh factor blood grouping system - Many people also have a so called Rh factor on the red blood cell's surface. This is also an antigen and those who have it are called Rh+. Those who haven't are called Rh-. A person with Rh- blood does not have Rh antibodies naturally in the blood plasma (as one can have A or B antibodies, for instance). But a person with Rh- blood can develop Rh antibodies in the blood plasma if he or she receives blood from a person with Rh+ blood, whose Rh antigens can trigger the production of Rh antibodies. A person with Rh+ blood can receive blood from a person with Rh- blood without any problems. \n According to above blood grouping systems, you can belong to either of following 8 blood groups: \n A Rh+ \n B Rh+ \n AB Rh+ \n 0 Rh+ \n A Rh- \n B Rh- \n AB Rh- \n 0 Rh- \n You mix the blood with three different reagents including either of the three different antibodies, A, B or Rh antibodies. Then you take a look at what has happened. \n In which mixtures has agglutination occurred? The agglutination indicates that the blood has reacted with a certain antibody and therefore is not compatible with blood containing that kind of antibody. \n If the blood does not agglutinate, it indicates that the blood does not have the antigens binding the special antibody in the reagent. \n If you know which antigens are in the person's blood, it's easy to figure out which blood group he or she belongs to! Application: \n A person with A+ blood receives B+ blood. The B antibodies (yellow) in the A+ blood attack the foreign red blood cells by binding to them. The B antibodies in the A+ blood bind the antigens in the B+ blood and agglutination occurs. This is dangerous because the agglutinated red blood cells break after a while and their contents leak out and become toxic. \n A person with A+ blood receives B+ blood. The B antibodies (yellow) in the A+ blood attack the foreign red blood cells by binding to them. The B antibodies in the A+ blood bind the antigens in the B+ blood and agglutination occurs. This is dangerous because the agglutinated red blood cells break after a while and their contents leak out and become toxic. \n For a blood transfusion to be successful, AB0 and Rh blood groups must be compatible between the donor blood and the patient blood. If they are not, the red blood cells from the donated blood will clump or agglutinate. The agglutinated red cells can clog blood vessels and stop the circulation of the blood to various parts of the body. The agglutinated red blood cells also crack and its contents leak out in the body. The red blood cells contain hemoglobin which becomes toxic when outside the cell. This can have fatal consequences for the patient. \n The A antigen and the A antibodies can bind to each other in the same way that the B antigens can bind to the B antibodies. This is what would happen if, for instance, a B blood person receives blood from an A blood person. The red blood cells will be linked together, like bunches of grapes, by the antibodies. As mentioned earlier, this clumping could lead to death. \n Of course, you can always give A blood to persons with blood group A, B blood to a person with blood group B and so on. But in some cases you can receive blood with another type of blood group, or donate blood to a person with another kind of blood group. \n The transfusion will work if a person who is going to receive blood has a blood group that doesn't have any antibodies against the donor blood's antigens. But if a person who is going to receive blood has antibodies matching the donor blood's antigens, the red blood cells in the donated blood will clump. \n This is the localization of antigens or proteins in tissue sections by the use of labeled antibodies as specific reagents through antigen-antibody interactions that are visualized by a marker such as fluorescent dye, enzyme, or colloidal gold. There are numerous immunohistochemistry methods that may be used to localize antigens. The selection of a suitable method should be based on parameters such as the type of specimen under investigation and the degree of sensitivity required. \n Cancer occurs as a result of mutations, or abnormal changes, in the genes responsible for regulating the growth of cells and keeping them healthy. The genes are in each cell’s nucleus, which acts as the “control room” of each cell. Normally, the cells in our bodies replace themselves through an orderly process of cell growth: healthy new cells take over as old ones die out. But over time, mutations can “turn on” certain genes and “turn off” others in a cell. That changed cell gains the ability to keep dividing without control or order, producing more cells just like it and forming a tumor. \n A tumor can be benign (not dangerous to health) or malignant (has the potential to be dangerous). Benign tumors are not considered cancerous: their cells are close to normal in appearance, they grow slowly, and they do not invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors are cancerous. Left unchecked, malignant cells eventually can spread beyond the original tumor to other parts of the body. \n During the immunohistochemical staining of a tissue, antigens are usually expressed if the tissue stains positive. These antigens can either be breast cancer antigens or non-breast cancer antigens \n Breast Cancer Antigens under investigation \n A. Estrogen Receptor (ER) \n B. Progesterone Receptor (PR) \n C. Her – 2 neu \n Non Breast antigens \n A. Leucocytes common antibody (LCA) for Lymphoma \n B. AE1 and AE2 for epithelial tumor and other carcinoma \n C. Vimentin for messenchyma tumor \n D. NSE \n E. CD5 \n F. CD20 \n G. CD30 \n H. Desmin \n I. Myogenin \n Breast cancer is an uncontrolled growth of breast cells. To better understand breast cancer, it helps to understand how any cancer can develop. The term “breast cancer” refers to a malignant tumor that has developed from cells in the breast. Usually breast cancer either begins in the cells of the lobules, which are the milk-producing glands, or the ducts, the passages that drain milk from the lobules to the nipple. Less commonly, breast cancer can begin in the stromal tissues, which include the fatty and fibrous connective tissues of the breast. \n 
 It’s important to distinguish between these two terms and to use them properly in your assessment. \n A hazard is anything that may cause harm. For example: chemicals, electricity, working from heights like a ladder, or an open drawer.A risk is the chance that these hazards could cause harm to others. For example: a chemical burn or an electric shock, a fall from heights, or an injury from hitting an open drawer.\n Think about any hazards you notice as you walk around. Ask yourself, what activities, processes, or substances could injure your employees or harm their health?Look at any objects, office furniture or pieces of machinery that could be hazards. Examine any substances in the workplace, from chemicals to hot coffee. Think about how these substances could injury your employees.If you work in an office, look for any long wires in walkways or under desks, as well as any broken drawers, cupboards, or counter tops. Examine the chairs at your employees' workstations, the windows, and the doors. Look for any hazards in the common areas, such as a faulty microwave or an uncovered section on the coffee machine. \n If you work in a big box store or a warehouse, look for any machinery that could be hazards. Note any spare materials, like hangers or safety clips, that could spill or land on an employee. Look for any hazards in the aisles of the store, like narrow shelving or cracked sections of the floors. \n Your employees will be able to help you identify any hazards they encounter on the job. Send out an email or have an in person discussion asking for feedback on any possible hazards in the workplace.Ask specifically about hazards that your employees think could result in significant harm, such as slips and trips, fire hazards, and falling from heights. \n They can help to explain the hazards and put them in perspective in terms of how the equipment was made to be used and how misuse can lead to hazards.The manufacturer's instructions will likely be on the labels of any equipment or substances. You can also check the manufacturer's manual for more information on possible hazards associated with the equipment or substances. \n These documents will help you identify less obvious hazards, and any hazards that have occurred before in the workplace.If you are in a management position, you can likely access these records for your company online or in the company files. \n Long term hazards are hazards that will have an impact on workers when they exposed to the hazards for a long period of time. \n These could be exposure to high levels of noise, or exposure to harmful substances over a sustained period of time. This could also be safety hazards through the repetitive use of equipment, from a lever on a work site to a keyboard at a desk., Depending on your country, you can access practical guidance on hazards in the workplace via a government health and safety guidelines website. These sites have a list of hazards and possible ways to control them, including recognized hazards such as working at height, working with chemicals, and working with machinery. \n In the U.S., you can access the government health and safety guidelines website here: https://www.osha.gov/. \n In the UK, you can access the government health and safety guidelines website here: http://www.hse.gov.uk/. \n You are creating an overview of all potential individuals at risk, so avoid listing every worker by name. Instead, make a list of groups of people in an environment. \n For example, “people working in the storeroom” or “passers-by on the street.” \n You then need to identify what type of injury or ill health might occur for each group. \n For example: “shelf stackers may suffer back injuries from repeated lifting of boxes”. Or, “machinery workers may suffer joint pain from repeated use of a lever.” \n This could also be more specific injuries like "workers may be burned by the printing press" or "cleaners may trip over the wires under the desks". \n Keep in mind some workers may have particular requirements, such as new and young workers, new or expectant mothers, and people with disabilities. \n You will also need to account for cleaners, visitors, contractors, and maintenance workers who may not be in the workplace all the time. It’s important to also identify any possible hazards to the general public, or “passers-by”. \n If the workplace is a shared space among several workers or several hundred workers, it’s important to reach out to your employees and ask them who they think is at risk. Think about how your work affects others present and how their work affects your staff. \n Ask your staff if they can think of any group you may have missed when identifying who is affected by certain hazards. For example, you may not realize that the cleaning staff also has to deal with lifting boxes at your employee’s desks, or you may not be aware that a certain piece of machinery is a noise hazard for pedestrians on the street. \n Risk is a part of everyday life and through you might be the boss or the person in charge, you are not expected to eliminate all the risks. But you need to make sure you are aware of the main risks and you know how to address and manage these risks. So, you need to do everything “reasonably practicable” to protect people from harm. This means balancing the level of risk against the measures needed to control the real risk in terms of money, time, or trouble.Keep in mind you do not need to take action that would be considered disproportionate to the level of risk. Don’t go overboard on your risk assessment. You should only include what you could be expected to know, within reason. You are not expected to anticipate unforeseen risks. \n For example, a risk of a chemical spill should be taken seriously and noted as a major hazard. But smaller risks, like a stapler harming someone using it or the lid of a jar hitting someone, are not considered "reasonably practicable". Do your best to identify major and minor hazards, but do not try to account for every possible hazard in the workplace. \n For example, maybe you provide shelf stockers with back protectors and safety gear (also known as PPE, or Personal Protective Equipment). But ask yourself: Can I get rid of the hazard altogether? Is there a way to rearrange the storeroom so shelf stockers do not have to lift boxes from the ground? If this is not possible, ask: how can I control the risks so that harm is unlikely? Practical solutions include:Trying a less risky option. Such as having the boxes on a raised platform or ledge to reduce the distance the shelf stockers will have to lift from. \n Preventing access to the hazards, or organizing the workplace to reduce exposure to the hazard. Such as rearranging the storeroom so the boxes are placed at a level that do not require lifting by the shelf stockers. \n Issuing protective equipment or protective practices to your workers. Such as back guards, PPE, and information on how to complete an action safely. For example, you could educate shelf stockers on how to properly lift a box from the ground, bending at the knees, with a straight back. \n Providing welfare facilities, such as first aid and washing facilities. If your workers deal with chemicals in the workplace, for example, you should provide washing facilities and first aid close to their workstations. \n Improving health and safety does not necessarily mean spending a lot of company money. Simple adjustments like placing a mirror on a blind corner to prevent vehicle accidents, or holding a brief training session on how to lift objects properly are all low-cost precautions.In fact, failing to take simple precautions can cost you a lot more if an accident does happen. The safety of your workers should mean more than the bottom line. So if possible, spring for higher-cost solutions if they are your only option. Spending money on precautions is a better choice than having to take care of an injured worker. \n Many of these groups come up with risk assessments for particular activities, like working with heights or working with chemicals. Look at the National Institute for Occupational Safetyand websites that focus on a certain sector, like miningor administration. \n Try to apply these model assessments to your workplace and adapt them as necessary. For example, a model assessment may have suggestions on how to prevent a fall from a ladder in the workplace. Or a suggestion on how to make loose wires in the office more safe for employees. You can then apply these suggestions in your own risk assessment, based on the specifics of your workplace. \n It’s important to involve your workers in the process of evaluating the risks and coming up with possible precautions. This will ensure that what you propose will work in practice and won’t introduce any new hazards into the workplace., The assessment should cover the hazards, how people might be harmed by them, and what you have in place to control the risks. \n If you have fewer than five employees, by law you do not have to write down a risk assessment. But it’s useful to do this so you can review it at a later date and update it.If you have five or more employees, you are required by law to write down the assessment. \n There are several templates available online, based on the type of workplace you work in.A basic risk assessment should show that: \n A proper check of the hazard was made. \n You asked who might be affected. \n You dealt with the obvious, major hazards, and took into account the number of people who could be involved. \n The precautions taken are reasonable and practical. \n The remaining risk is low and/or manageable. \n You involved your employees in the process. \n If the nature of your work changes often or the workplace changes and develops, such as a construction site, your risk assessment may have to concentrate on a broad range of risks that can be anticipated. This could mean the possible state of the site your workers will be building on that day, or the possible physical hazards in the area, like fallen trees or rocks. \n If your risk assessment identifies a number of hazards, you need to rank them in order of importance. For example, a chemical spill in a chemical plant will likely be the most serious risk, and a back injury from lifting a barrel in the chemical plant may be a less serious risk. \n The rankings of the hazards are usually based on common sense. Consider the hazards that could lead to serious injuries like death, the loss of a limb, or a serious burn or cut. Then, work down from the most serious to the least serious. \n This could mean better spill prevention for the chemical plant, or a clear evacuation procedure in the event of a spill. You could also provide high quality PPE for workers to prevent exposure to the chemicals. \n Note if these improvements or solutions can be implemented quickly, or even with temporary fixes, until more reliable controls can be put in place. \n Remember that the greater the hazard, the more robust and reliable the control measures will need to be. \n Your risk assessment may include the need for employee training on a safety practice, like picking up a box from the ground properly, or for training on how to deal with a chemical spill. \n Another approach is to use a risk assessment matrix, which helps you determine how likely or unlikely a risk may occur in your workplace. The matrix will have a column for “Consequence and Likelihood”, which is divided into: \n Rare: May occur only in exceptional circumstances. \n Unlikely: Could occur at some time. \n Possible: Might occur at some time. \n Likely: Will probably occur in most circumstances. \n Almost Certain: Is expected to occur in most circumstances. \n The top column will then be divided into sections for: \n Insignificant: Low financial loss, no disruption to capability, no impact on community standing. \n Minor: Medium financial loss, minor disruption to capability, minor impact on community standing. \n Serious: High financial loss, some ongoing disruption to capability, modest impact on community standing. \n Disastrous: Major financial loss, ongoing disruption to capability, major impact of community standing. \n Catastrophic: Mission critical financial loss, permanent disruption to capability, and ruinous impact on community standing. \n A copy of an example risk matrix can be found here: https://intranet.ecu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/207080/how-to-write-a-risk-assessment-and-management-plan.pdf. \n You are not required by law to share the risk assessment with your workers but it may be a good practice to share the completed document with them.File a hard copy of the risk assessment and keep an electronic copy on the company's shared drive. You want to have easy access to the document so you can update it or adjust it accordingly. \n Few workplaces stay the same, and sooner or later, you will bring in new equipment, substances, and procedures that could lead to new hazards. Review your employee’s work practices on a daily basis, and update the risk assessment. Ask yourself:Have there been any changes? \n Have you learnt anything from accidents or near misses? \n Set up a review date for the risk assessment in a year’s time. If there is a significant change at your workplace during the year, update the risk assessment as soon as possible. \n 
 Most people don't know what cheerleading really is. If your parents think that cheerleaders are mean people that do nothing but wave pom-poms, explain to them what you really want to do, how much you love cheerleading, and that all-star cheerleading is not the same thing as cheering for your school or football. Make sure you aren't putting them on the spot. Make sure they agree with you and you aren't pressuring them. They will more likely help you if you stay calm and show them your mature.\n Be happy, smile, make friends, don't be mean, laugh a lot, and be sporty! Remember that being mean and rude to other teammates could get you kicked off the cheerleading team, so remember to be nice to everyone in your team and outside our team. Also make sure that you pick a good team. \n Before you become an all-star cheerleader, you need to know what all-star cheerleading is. Look up videos on Youtube or visit the USASF (US All-Star Federation) website to see how it's like being an all-star cheerleader. Know all the rules and levels so you'll have an idea what level you'll be on and what you'll be doing. And be sure to know the difference between all-star cheerleading and football/basketball cheerleading before you sign up! \n If you're tall and strong, you'll probably be a base or backspot. If you're short, flexible, and agile you'll probably be a flyer. If you're a combination of both, maybe you could be two things at a time! \n Look on the website for pictures, look on youtube for videos, and see if on the website they have requirements for the team you want to try out for. For previews on competitions go to websites like Jamfest or U.S. Nationals. Remember to find a good team. If the team only has seven girls or goes in only two competitions a year, you might not want to join if cheerleading is your passion. Make sure you join a good sized teams with plenty of levels and that goes on competitions! And if possible, try joining a team that goes to Worlds. \n Don't be lazy! You should practice a little everyday. Stretch and exercise. \n Believe it or not, the more flexible you are, the less you'll get hurt, because your body will be so used to bending. Stretch every day and do a couple of strength exercises like crunches, lemon squeezes, and push-ups about three times a week. \n Run at least once a week. Being strong can help you get better at a lot of cheerleading things, like jumping, tumbling, stunting, or maybe even dancing if your team's dance is fast and difficult. \n Do tumbling, private lessons, or a be in a recreational team for about two months before you actually do the real thing, and remember that you must know the basics. Those classes will teach you all the basics. If you already took something like gymnastics or tumbling before, you don't really have to. The better you are at tumbling, the more likely you'll be able to make a higher level in your team. \n Practice in front of the mirror and remember to squeeze your body the whole time. While doing motions, keep your fists straight up and tight, not bent! The better your basics are, the better your tumbling will be. \n Practice every day and when you're sitting down, be in the position of the jump you want to learn/improve. When you jump, whip your legs and arms as hard as possible and keep your arms tight (that's why basic motions are important in cheerleading). \n It may sound silly, but dance is important in all-star cheer. If you don't know how to dance, you'll be all messed up while your teammates are doing great in a competition, and all all-star cheer routines have at least one dance part in them. Your dance moves should be clean and tight, and remember to do facials/smile while you dance. \n They are very important cheerleading skills. Remember that in most tumbling passes, a cheerleader will do a roundoff/roundoff back handspring before she does the final trick. Even thought a back handspring is essential, don't attempt one unless your coach already gave you permission to, because if you did one by yourself and fell, that could lead to serious injury. \n If you fall backwards, just do a candle rock with your arms straight above your head, and stand back up. If you fall forwards, tuck your chin in and roll. \n If you have a fear of going backwards, just practice jumping backwards on a mattress and doing bridges. Remember that tumbling can sometimes be scary/dangerous, so be prepared to fall, because it's impossible to never fall! \n Don't be scared in any position you take. If you're a base, make sure you get under your flyer and don't be scared. If you're scared then the flyer will be scared as well. Be confident. If your a back-spot, don't be scared as well. Make sure you're catching your flyer if you do cradles or baskets. You need to grab the flyer's ankles or the base's wrists and pull up to relieve some of the weight. When doing cradles or baskets, help push then step aside to catch. \n Facials give you more points in competitions and just make your team look better while performing. You need to look like you're having fun in a competition, because if you look bored, you're probably gonna lose. \n Once you feel prepared, sign up for try-outs. Don't worry, you always make the team when you're an all-star! \n Smile all the time and don't attempt anything you can't do or anything too dangerous. Be confident and always stretch first. Wear comfortable clothes. Look at the judges/coaches in the eye and pretend you're just at home and no one is watching! \n Don't make cliques in your team and don't try to mess anyone up! Also, don't laugh at someone if they fell or they can't do a tumbling trick everyone else in the team can do. \n Don't cry, be upset, or be too hard on yourself. Always be positive, because all cheerleaders are supposed to have a positive attitude. \n Granola bars or energy drinks can be good, but don't drink too much caffeine or you'll get too hyper and will not be able to tumble! \n Even if you already have a back handspring, using a barrel/roller will make your back handsprings even better than they already are. \n \n Don't be afraid. The more you're afraid, the worse it may be. Stay clam throughout your routine, keep your composure, and work on facials. Facials is what wins the judges over. \n 
 a plastic bottle. You can use any you like, but 3 liter (0.8 US gal) cider bottles would be better if you wanted a bigger biodome.\n The heavy, black plastic bottom has groves which add strength to the bottom shape. The oval dome lid snaps tightly onto this bottom. \n After enjoying the chicken, wash the container lid and bottom completely. (The big label sticker on the outside can be removed with a little Gumout or WD40). In the bottom fill the deeper grooves with coarse sand or fine, washed pea gravel. \n Add real soil scooped out of your backyard with a spoon, building up about 1 inch (2.5 cm), patted down. Now, in your backyard or a city waste lot, find some small, low lying plants that are only a few inches high. Wet the area around each such wild plant with a cup of water. Then use a larger tablespoon to dig down and under the roots of the little plant you have watered, and gently lift it out. \n Many common weeds that are mowed, burned over or stepped on are fine. 2 examples would be wild strawberry, ordinary grass, or plantain. Even newly emergent seedlings, if they are small enough, will work. \n Taking care to keep as much of the roots and soil around them as possible when you lift them out, place them into the layer of soil you have put into the bottom. Now gather a few more such plants. \n Even shingles on a roof often have moss on them that can be carefully scraped off. So after adding some compost soil or topsoil put some moss on the top and arranged around the little plants as a top ground cover. If the plants wilt a little at first, they will be fine when you water them if you have gotten most of the fine roots into the soil. Now sprinkle water gently until the soil, moss and plants are well watered. Your bottom plastic base will let excess water, and eventually the plant roots drain down into the deeper grooves. \n Here you have to be careful no soil or plant parts are in the area you have to snap together. When you have snapped the lid. on correctly it will be tight and snug. \n So, with a heated sewing needle (from a candle flame or match) you are now going to punch the hot needle through the upper sides of the dome roof in clusters of about 6 - 10 needle sized holes. #*Do this at each upper end, and the middle of each upper side. This will allow some moisture to escape so that the entire dome doesn't cloud or "fog" up. (The needle holes will be too small for bugs to escape.) \n Once sealed up, these little biodomes will not need more water added for many months, even most of a year. \n Cut 3 sides of the door only, so that the door can be opened and closed as needed, and use a tab of mending tape to keep the lid closed. For bugs, try to avoid earthworms. Small beetles or crickets or sowbugs are fine. Lacewings are good, and fruit flies will work too, if you can catch them. \n Remember, you can also use a larger, fancy cake tray and dome that many grocery stores sell in the deli or bakery. The main thing with a larger such deli dome, is that you need the black plastic bottom tray to have enough rigidity and grooves for the sand and excess water. \n But, what the heck - even if you have to eat the whole cake, it only weighs 3 - 4 pounds. Invite someone to help you eat it. \n Firm it down to help stop bacteria. \n Consider putting in these plants: \n Fruit producing plants \n Perennial plants, plants that don't need much water \n Self fertile plants \n Plants that produce a large amount of seeds. \n \n Then, leave the seedlings (you should have about 3 or 4 evenly spaced) until they have covered most of the compost. \n If you want to be extra sure there are no gaps, put something like superglue around the joint. \n The crickets or beetles will produce carbon dioxide that the plants will take in and give off oxygen as a by-product. The crickets will breathe the oxygen and the cycle goes on. The plants will be eaten slightly by the crickets, but, making sure they are fast growing, they will give the crickets or beetles the supply they need. \n Of course, the plants will take in the water you gave them, and they will respire and the water will just evaporate and condense, and will give the give the crickets something to drink and the plant something to drink. The crickets or beetles will get rid of the water one way or another, so it goes on. \n The plants will get energy from the soil and light, the leaves will die off through time (replaced by new ones) and will rot into the soil, recycling nutrients and giving back the water that was retained in the leaves. \n 
\n There are 4 sets of goals and each set contains 5 goals, so you can create a maximum of 20 goals. \n \n The "On" radio button will be selected by default, but you can select the "Off" radio button if you want to activate your goal at a later time. \n \n The Goal Position field can be useful if you have multiple goals and want them to appear in a specific order in your Analytics reports. \n \n Choose "URL Destination" if your goal is to have visitors land on a specific page on your website. This goal option will allow you to set up a funnel, which is useful if you want to track the progress of visitors as they click through pages to reach the goal destination. \n Choose "Time on Site" if you want to measure the amount of time a visitor spends on your website. \n Choose "Pages per Visit" if you want to view how many pages visitors browsed while they were on your website. \n \n The Match Type field determines how you want the URL used by the visitor to match with the URL you identify for this goal type. In some cases, a URL can change slightly depending on where the visitor is coming from. An Exact Match is when all your URLs remain the same and never change. A Head Match allows you to designate a specific string of characters in your URL that you want matched and can be useful if visitors have an identification number when they are logged into your website. Regular Expression enables wild card matching of certain characters in the URL and is helpful if visitors land on the URL from a sub-domain. \n \n Include the part of your URL that follows after your domain; do not provide your domain. For example, if your website ends in ".com," include all the characters following ".com," including the forward slash. \n \n If your domain or URL requires certain upper-case or lower-case letters for it to work, place a check mark in the field next to "Case Sensitive." \n \n For example, if your URL Destination is a checkout page for visitors that buy a product from you, enter the amount of total transactions you want to occur. \n \n Click on "Yes, create a funnel for this goal" to open your funnel options. \n Provide each URL in the series of URLs for the funnel by typing in the characters following your website's domain. \n
 Don't treat yourself the way you wouldn't treat a friend. This means no more insulting yourself when you look in the mirror, setting harsh dieting rules, or beating yourself up when you make a mistake. If it would be mean to treat a friend that way, then stop treating yourself that way.\n Don't worry about trends or fashion "rules"—choose clothes that make you look good and feel confident and comfortable. It's usually good to wear something you can move around in. \n You don't need to wear makeup. If you decide to try it, start small and work your way up as desired. \n Wear clothes that make you feel happy. Whether you love lace, rainbows, overalls, or poofy skirts, you should choose clothes that work for you. \n Skimpy outfits can move around when you wear them, and it's no fun to be constantly monitoring your neckline or hem. Err on the side of modesty so that you can have fun without worrying about whether your clothes are in place. \n Treat it with respect, and look after your health. Work fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fruits into your diet. Get plenty of sleep and relaxation. Find ways to make exercise fun, like dancing, swimming, walks with loved ones, and backyard sports. \n Focus less on what your body looks like, and more on what it can do. \n Drinking, smoking, and drugs are very bad for you! Avoiding or quitting them will help you feel more energetic, positive, and alert. \n Try to go to bed and wake up at around the same time each day. This will help your body get into a good rhythm. Ask your parents to remind you to go to bed if it helps. \n Your free time is precious, so use it for what matters most to you. Engage in your favorite hobbies, read good books, and hang out with people you love. To shake things up, make a list of all the things you'd like to try someday. Then start trying them. \n TV is great for relaxing, but too much TV can leave you drained and tired. Balance your free time to include hobbies, family, and friends. \n Just as you're growing physically and emotionally, you're also growing intellectually. Try reading books from different genres, from classics to science fiction. Try hobbies from arts and sciences. What is fun to you? \n Look for articles online about topics that you enjoy. \n The media can have discouraging messages, such as hypersexuality, mean behavior, and rude and incorrect stereotypes. This is not healthy. Surround yourself with media that celebrates your values, and the type of person you want to be. \n Look for media that supports your self-esteem, especially in fighting negative stereotypes. A girl who loves robots could watch TV with women in STEM, a girl who uses a wheelchair could read books about people with disabilities, and plus-size girls can look at pictures of stunning women of the same size. Remind yourself that people like you exist and have worth. \n Even the kindest, most cheerful people have bad days sometimes. It's okay to feel sad, get a bad grade on a test, or lose your cool every once in a while. Being good does not mean you have to be perfect, and people will understand that. \n If you feel down, try talking to someone about how you feel. You'll feel better, and they'll be glad they could help. \n If you make a big mistake, talk about it. Apologize to anyone you hurt, and ask how you can make up for it. The mistake is less important than how you handle it. \n Maybe this means talking to a loved one who inspires you, going to a religious or volunteering group, reading a book that exemplifies your values, or even re-reading this article. When you feel lost or uncertain, it can remind you of your purpose and the way you want to live your life. \n They have more life experience than you do, so they may be wiser than you realize. Ask them for advice, and value the things they tell you (even if you don't always agree). Think about how many good things they have done for you. Chances are, you'll never able to stop counting. \n Parents aren't perfect, and sometimes they give bad advice and make bad decisions. Hear them out, and then explain your point of view as calmly as you can. Work together to figure out a good approach. \n When you see your parents or siblings looking like they need help (struggling with packages, doing chores, etc.) say "Is there anything I can do to help you?" Open doors for them, help carry things... little things can make a big difference. \n The next time you see your parents or older siblings doing chores, try asking them to show you how. The two of you can do it together. You'll practice and help out at home, and then you'll be good at it when you're an independent adult. Learn how to cook, do laundry, do housework, and other basic tasks. Help out your parents and anyone you see who could use a hand. \n Try yard work like mowing your lawn, taking care of the plants, and weeding. \n Try your hand at basic engineering tasks, such as auto repair, changing a flat tire, and fixing a leaky tap. Girls are better at engineering than most people realize! \n Some parents are willing to set up an allowance in exchange for chores, or pay you for doing chores (e.g. $10 for mowing the lawn). \n Clean your room and any messes that you make around the house. If you see messes that are not yours, you can still help clean them up. Sweep, vacuum, put away clutter and dirty clothes, and clean things like windows and mirrors. \n Cleaning up other people's messes is nice, and optional. Don't feel obligated if you don't have the energy. \n Look for the things that you have in common, and have fun together. Speak politely to them (even when they annoy you!), and respect their boundaries—they'll probably do the same to you in return. \n Let them have space when they need it. \n If you can't handle your siblings right now, then don't. Say that you need some quiet time, and retreat to a quiet space. Your siblings should respect that, and if they don't, ask an adult for help. \n Be respectful, kind, and helpful to everyone at school. This will make people like and respect you more. \n Study for all tests and quizzes, because they all count. Turn in your homework on time and pay attention in class. Participate in class for even more points towards your grade. \n Teachers love it when you raise your hand in class, whether it's to give an answer or ask a question. If you give a wrong answer, it's okay. \n Do your homework promptly every night and do the best job that you can on it. This will give you better grades, and it will also help you become more disciplined and responsible. \n Cramming for three hours straight isn't good for your health, and you won't learn as much. Start working early to make it easy on yourself. Then you can take lots of study breaks and feel less pressured. \n Don't stay up late studying before a test. You need your brain to be fresh and alert, so get plenty of sleep in order to prepare. \n Look at the teacher, face front, and focus on note-taking and listening. \n Don't chat, text, pass notes, or use your phone in class. These are disrespectful to your teacher and your peers who are trying to learn. \n If you have a disability that causes you to fidget or appear inattentive to non-disabled people, let your teacher know. Find ways to accommodate your needs so you can focus. \n Learn to ask politely for help if you are struggling in your classes. Most people love to give advice and be helpful, and your teachers want to see you succeed. Explain that you're struggling and ask for help. Their advice can help you, and they'll respect you more for it. \n Remember the platinum rule: treat others the way they would like to be treated. This means being respectful and considerate. \n As a general rule, don't say something behind someone's back that you wouldn't feel comfortable saying in their presence. \n It's normal to have wants and needs, so be assertive and ask for things. Use "I" statements like "I would like...", "I think...", or "When you ____, I..." \n Being passive might feel kinder, but it isn't. Hinting or beating around the bush will only confuse or frustrate people. \n Listening and validating people's feelings are tremendously useful skills. This means treating them like what they say and how they feel is important (even if you don't agree with them). People will feel much better and start opening up to you if you do this. \n Whether it's small like holding a door for someone, or big like creating a picture book for your little brother, random acts of kindness are a great way to be and feel good. Look for opportunities to make people smile. \n If you think your friend's shirt is awesome, let him know. If your sister made a really cool science project, tell her how much you like it. Even a random compliment from a stranger can brighten someone's day. \n Sometimes it's a bad time—for example, you wouldn't stand up in the middle of a concert and shout "I love your singing!" You can wait until a good moment (e.g. after the concert), or tell other people about your thought. People always feel happy when they learn you've been saying good things about them behind their back. \n Everybody has positive traits, so look for them in each new person you meet. Treat them with the assumption that they are well-meaning and intelligent in their own way. They may just rise to meet your expectations. \n Keep doing this, and you will be a ray of sunshine that inspires others to be their best. \n A few people are mean and rude no matter what you do. Keep a safe distance from these people, and continue being positive. It may rub off on them, or it may not. \n It can be tempting to write people off as "weird," "stupid," or "stuck up." Don't. Everyone has a story, and is struggling in a way that you might not notice. Treat everyone like they are good at heart. \n Be respectful to everyone, including the people you don't like. They may warm up to you. \n Courtesy will show others that you are considerate and mature. Use the phrases "please", "thank you", and "may I". Let other people go first. Get a book on everyday etiquette, or ask someone who appears to be particularly knowledgeable on it. \n People may say things that don't make sense to you—but they probably have a good reason. Instead of giving up or getting mad at them, ask questions. This works in a variety of perplexing situations, from a person who is acting strange to someone who is being mean. \n "That's interesting. Why would you say/ask/do that?" \n "I don't understand. Could you explain it?" \n "I'm surprised that an educated and considerate person like you would stereotype transgender people like that." (Compliments can defuse rude behavior.) \n Nobody can truly "win" an argument. Calm yourself down, or excuse yourself if you don't think you can handle it calmly. You can always continue the discussion later when you have a cooler head. \n "I need to take a break." \n "I don't know how to respond to that." \n "I'm so upset, I don't know how to handle this. I'm going to take some quiet time." \n You won't get along perfectly with everyone, and that's okay. Spend your time and energy on the people who build you up and make you feel good. They can help you feel happy and remind you of the person you want to be. \n You're allowed not to be best friends with everyone. If you feel upset when you're around someone, be polite to them, and focus your attention elsewhere. \n A good girl doesn't rush into romance, and makes sure that she is ready before trying something new. Communicate with your partner, and talk about kissing and intimate touching before you do them. \n Learn how to say no. An "I don't want to," "Not tonight," "I'm not ready for that," or just plain "no" makes it clear to your partner how you feel. \n Learn to recognize danger signals. Some people are disrespectful: they push your boundaries, laugh off your discomfort or worries, or trash-talk other people. Steer clear of them. \n When someone does something kind for you, let them know you're grateful with a simple smile or "Thanks!" Give them a hug or some kind words sometimes, so they know how much you care. \n 
, Using the socket ended crossbar, loosen the lug nuts on the left or right front tire (the side you start on does not mater). Put a block of wood behind the opposite side tire to make sure the car does not move when jacking or working. \n When jacking up your car, make sure to use the dealer specified jacking points first; if you feel the dealer specified jacking points are not safe simply use the pinch weld, as close as you feel is safe to the dealer jacking points \n Make sure the jack stands and car do not move. \n Remove the caliper mounting bolts using the socket set. After the bolts have been removed, tie the caliper to the coil spring making sure the hydraulic line stays attached to the caliper. Take notice of where the bolts are removed from. \n Take notice of which holes the bolts come out of. \n The rotor may be difficult to get off due to rust and/or friction, but the rotor simply pulls off \n Most professional mechanics prefer to clean the braking surface with brake clean fluid before installation. This is not mandatory step but it is preferable to remove manufacturing compounds that may be left over., Rotors, brake pads, and brake pad clips should all be replaced together as a set, as they affect how the rotors and pads wear while in operation. \n Remember to put the bolts and mount back in the original position they were removed from. There is no torque spec for this component but it should not move at all. Tighten until the component is stable on the car. \n \n A second person will be needed for the step. Untie the caliper from the coil spring and set aside the wire. It will not be needed further for the current side. Using the C-clamp, compress the piston all the way down. \n There is no torque spec for this step but the caliper should be secured to the mounting bracket. \n Torque specs can be found in your vehicle owner's manual. \n Lower the car back down to the ground. \n 
 Thrush, or oral candidiasis, is caused by an overgrowth of a type of fungus, or yeast, called candida albicans. Candida is a normal part of the body.Candida albicans is naturally found throughout the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth. Candida is also a normal resident of the skin.A thrush infection happens when the candida albicans yeast cells find a source of nutrients they like, and grow beyond what is considered normal.\n White, patchy areas on the tongue, and other parts of the mouth are the most common symptom.Additional symptoms include inflamed, or reddened, areas in the mouth, accompanied by soreness. This can cause a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and a loss of taste.Some areas might bleed slightly if they are scraped.Cracking, itching and pain at the corners of the mouth is common with oral thrush., Understand the risks of untreated thrush infections. Candidiasis infection, like thrush, left untreated can result in serious health problems.Candida is normally present on the skin, and throughout the gut, and causes no health problems.However, when an overgrowth occurs, it is important to treat the condition before it spreads further, and gains access to the systemic circulation. A systemic candidiasis infections is called invasive candidiasis.Realize the seriousness of an invasive candidiasis infection. Invasive candidiasis is an infection that occurs when the candida infection spreads into the systemic circulation, called candidemia.This type of infection is a serious condition, and can affect the blood, heart, brain, eyes, bones, as well as other parts of the body.People with weaker immune systems are the ones primarily at risk of developing invasive candidiasis. This type of infection requires hospitalization, involves added expense, and, in some cases, results in less than desirable outcomes.Invasive candidiasis is a major type of infection acquired by patients being treated in a hospital or facility setting for other reasons.See a doctor early. Seeking medical attention early and taking a prescription medication are the best ways to effectively manage the initial symptoms of a candida infection.This is the most effective approach to prevent invasive candidiasis and candidemia., It is somewhat rare to see oral thrush in healthy children, adolescents, and adults. But anyone can develop thrush, and the infection is easily treated.Since this condition is considered unusual in healthy people, there may be an underlying cause for the thrush to have developed.In addition, some conditions may look like candida, such as oral cancers or precancerous conditions, so make sure to see you doctor if you are haven't had thrush before or if it does not go away with treatment. \n It is recommended that cases of thrush be evaluated by a doctor to provide both effective treatment, and to be sure there is no change in the person’s overall immune system., According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, thrush, or candida, infections that develop in the mouth or throat require the use of prescription medications for effective treatment.The exact medications and the length of treatment will vary depending on the person’s age, general health status, currently prescribed medications, and immune system strength.Make sure that you complete the full prescribed course of medication, or else the thrush may return. \n Treating oral candidiasis is often done by using a product that can be applied topically. This is especially true for infants and young children.Liquid products, such as nystatin oral suspension, are applied topically by either swabbing, or “painting”, the suspension onto the surfaces infected. Nystatin is effective at treating the infection, and is safe if swallowed.In addition to using liquid forms, antifungal creams, ointments, and oral doses such as troches, deliver the medication in a topical manner.Use dissolvable prescription products. Some products are made in dissolvable forms, called troches, that are placed in the mouth to dissolve.This method of administration allows the medication to come into direct contact with the infected areas., In some cases, the medication may be prescribed in a tablet, capsule, or liquid form, that is intended to be swallowed.The antifungal medication works through systemic absorption, just like taking an antibiotic.Some examples of medications prescribed to treat thrush include fluconazole, nystatin, itraconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, posacanazole, and miconazole.These medications can interact with other medications, so be sure to tell your doctor what medications you conditions you have. They can also have side effects, so call your doctor if you develop any new symptoms while taking these medications. \n Infants that develop a thrush infections typically have the white, patchy, lesions, in their mouth. They may have trouble feeding, and be more fussy and irritable.The infant can pass the infection to the mother, then they continue to pass it back and forth, until the infection is effectively treated.The mother’s breasts can become unusually sensitive and reddened, with cracked and itchy nipples. The circular area around the nipple, called the areola, can turn shiny, with flaky skin areas.The mother may experience pain during nursing or notice pain in the nipple area between feedings. The discomfort may also feel like stabbing pains deeper within the breast., Tell your doctor if your baby has a diaper rash also, as candida may also cause a diaper rash, and your baby may need different treatment for this. If your doctor considers the case to be mild, he or she may recommend just using good hygiene measures, and watching the areas in both baby and mom for a few days.Treat the baby. If treatment is warranted, the medications can be easily and safely applied.In many cases, an antifungal product called nystatin suspension, can be prescribed. This is a liquid medication that can be applied directly into the baby’s mouth to the areas involved. \n The applications are often recommended several times a day for about a week.Treat mom. To allow the mother to continue breast feeding and disrupt the cycle of passing the infection back and forth, the same medication, or a similar one, may be prescribed. \n Topical antifungal creams or ointments are applied to the affected areas of the nipple on mom’s breast. Applications are usually recommended several times a day, for about a week, until both baby and mom are symptom free.You may also want to consider using disposable nursing pads to avoid passing the infection to your clothing.Talk to your doctor about cleaning or boiling items such as bottles and nipples, pacifiers and any detachable parts of a breast pump to reduce the chance of the infection coming back. \n People that are diabetic, are prescribed inhaled corticosteroids, take certain types of antibiotics, and people that wear dentures, develop oral thrush infections more often than otherwise healthy adults.Some people with serious illnesses that involve weakened immune systems more commonly experience oral candidiasis.These groups include people with HIV or AIDS, people receiving cancer treatments, and people that have had organ transplants., Make an appointment as soon as possible to have the thrush infection evaluated and treated.The doctor will choose the appropriate prescription medications based on the overall health and existing medications of the person with thrush.People that are elderly, have asthma or COPD, and people with weakened immune systems require quick intervention to prevent the thrush from spreading into their bloodstream. \n The at-risk groups are more challenging to treat since most are already taking a combination of medications that can sometimes interact with antifungal drugs. \n The doctors know how to properly combine the antifungal medications needed, with their current prescribed drugs, to quickly and effectively treat the thrush infection.In some cases, intravenous therapy and hospitalization may be the safest course of action., One scientific research study looked for evidence of efficacy for natural and herbal products claiming efficacy in treating oral candidiasis. Unfortunately, the researchers were not able to find any evidence to support the claims.This does not mean the natural and herbal products do not work. The study results suggest that further studies, following proper scientific research methods, are warranted in order to show efficacy for these treatment approaches., When you have a thrush infection, warm saltwater rinses may provide some relief.Ask your dentist or doctor about using saltwater rinses to be sure it is the best option for you.To make a saltwater rinse, dissolve ½ teaspoon of salt in 1 cup of warm water. \n Swish the rinse around in your mouth. Be sure to spit out the rinse and avoid swallowing it. Repeat this several times a day., Scientific research has shown that probiotics containing the lactobacilli species can help to control the overgrowth of candida albicans in some situations.The study authors recommend additional research in this area, but the initial work done in a controlled research setting was promising., The scientific literature suggests this to be possibly helpful in treating thrush. However, products available are not adequately regulated and exact dosing recommendations are not available.Talk to your doctor about specific products or sources, recommended by him or her, to treat thrush in this manner.Yogurt containing live or active cultures of the lactobacilli species are difficult to find. Yogurt products are now required to undergo processes like pasteurization that kills the live cultures. \n If you choose to try gentian violet, talk with your doctor first, then proceed carefully. Since safer and easier products are available, using gentian violet is often considered to be unfavorable option. \n Gentian violet is effective in the topical treatment of fungal infections, including oral candidiasis, but the product is difficult to use. The product should not be swallowed, and will stain the skin and clothing.Side effects of gentian violet include redness, and irritation at the site where it is applied. Gentian violet should not be swallowed. Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting can result. If gentian violet is swallowed, call a poison control center.One study found that gentian violet applied topically using a 0.00165% product was somewhat effective at treating oral thrush and did not stain the affected areas., See your dentist regularly, and follow recommendations provided by your dentist or your regular doctor.General recommendations to prevent thrush infections include brushing your teeth at least twice each day, floss once a day, and never share your toothbrush., Some people have trouble reaching all areas of their mouth with a regular toothbrush.Talk with your dentist about switching to an electric toothbrush if this will help you to more effectively clean your teeth., If you have recently had a thrush infection, you may want to replace your toothbrush several times.Use new toothbrushes, and discard any contaminated ones, until you are comfortable that the infection has been effectively treated, and your new toothbrush has not been contaminated., Some mouthwashes and rinses can alter the normal flora in your mouth, and allow for the candida infection to get started more easily.Talk to your dentist to be sure. Many dentists recommend the use of mouthwashes and mouth rinses., Sugary foods, and foods and beverages that contain yeast, can encourage the growth of candida. \n Limit the amounts of these foods that you eat or drink, and be sure to brush your teeth after eating., People that wear dentures at a higher risk of developing oral thrush infections.Your dentist can suggest different products and equipment to use in cleaning your dentures if this is happening to you., By maintaining tight control of your blood sugar levels, you can reduce the amounts of excess sugars that are found in your saliva.This helps to limit the sugary food source in your mouth area that helps the candida yeast to grow., Research has provided good evidence that this can help reduce the risk of oral candidiasis infections in people receiving cancer treatments.The most commonly prescribed prescription strength mouth rinse contains a solution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate., Some people with lung conditions, like asthma and COPD, regularly use inhaled corticosteroids.If you can, use a spacer (or aerochamber) attached to your inhaler. This greatly reduces oral thrush from using inhaled corticosteroids. Both children and adults should use spacers. In addition, they help the medication go deeper into the lungs instead of to the back of the mouth. \n People that use these products can reduce their risk for getting thrush by rinsing their mouth with water, or a doctor recommended mouth rinse, after each use of their inhaler.
 Then, try to make the dog put his head into the collar: don't push him if he is scared, but bring the harness very slowly closer and closer to the dog head, till he will have worn it; if he gets scared, freeze where you are, let him calm down, and then continue from where you stopped\n You will do this by praising him when he runs, recalling him and encouraging him to resume running when he stops. \n Also add 2 more words ( like "SLOW" and "RUN" ), when you decelerate and when you increase your speed. At the beginning, you will start on straight paths: later go where there are some crossroads too: you will repeat "LEFT" or "RIGHT" any time you turn one or another direction. \n If you are not sure, ask your vet about any doubt! Then, over weeks, slowly add speed and duration. Again, if in doubt, ask your vet, and anyway, better do less than the dog could do, than doing more and hurting him. \n Keep on praising and encouraging him when he runs in front if you, pulling you. If you notice he is unsure about what to do, increase your speed to make him understand he does have to run in front of you, faster than you, even if you are slowing down. \n At the beginning, do not ride the bike, but run by its side: once the dog will fully understand how to behave, you can start actually riding \n This step is not much different than passing from jogging to biking, but sled for sled dog are difficult to handle if you are not used to. Also, to pull one, you need at least three dogs, of the same size and weight. \n Also, this is a demanding activity so it is important your dog is fit and well muscled to avoid injuries. \n Also follow his/her warnings on how to proceed. \n when you start, start with something that is not more demanding than your dog's usual activity: if he is used to walking for 5 minutes a day, start with a 5 minutes walk. \n add difficulties gradually and slowly: a general rule is that when the dog, once home, stops being as tired as usual but only appears satisfied and still ready to go, it is time to add duration/speed. For example: you start off with a 20 minutes walk, and once home your dog is not willing to do anything more for the whole day; let's say that after 2 weeks, he comes home tired but after, say, 6 hours he is ready to play and run again: then, you can start adding difficulties, for example from 20 to 25/30 minutes walk \n train your dog for many activities: only doing one kind of activity/training and nothing else is unhealthy and can lead to injuries ( it happens with humans too ). Instead, alternate sled dog/running training with at least 2 other completely different sports, like disc dog ( lots of jumping ), agility ( jumping and sprinting ), swimming, etc. Also, teach your dog "tricks" ( things like: roll on the floor, give paw, etc. You can find many examples if you search for "dog tricks" on youtube ): they develop strength, agility and flexibility in dogs, which lead to less injuries, better performance, longer life and better health for the dog. \n do not overtrain your dog: learn and respect his limit, never force him to do something he is scared of, uncomfortable with. Always bear in mind that doing a bit less than your dog could, will cause no damage, while doing only a little bit more, might cause serious injuries, that might take very long to heal. Also, as said before, train your dog for many different activities, not only sled dog \n 
 This will protect your clothing from any "accidents."\n \n For most people who examine a fistulated cow, two shoulder-length gloves are best so that the material can be examined and handled by both hands. Often when one arm can't reach something, the other needs to be used instead. \n This will better protect your hands from the smell of the gastric juices \n The left side is where the cannula is always located. \n You may have to pull out the plug; to do this, you grab the top part of the handle and pull down. This will break the seal from the top down. \n However, remember it doesn't have to be tight together like if you were rectal palpating a cow, because the opening of the fistula is large enough to put your hand through up to your shoulder. \n You may have to pull out handfuls of feed to get your arm in there at first, depending on how full the rumen is. \n \n The gas layer is at the top of the rumen and able to leak out of the rumen as the cannula plug was removed. \n The second layer is the solid layer, which comprises of recently-consumed and partially digested roughage and grain. This is the stuff you should take out and examine before going in again. \n The liquid portion is the bottom and third layer, comprising of grain, liquid digesta, and small particles of roughage. The particles in the liquid layer are more often half to a tenth or smaller of the size of the particles in the solid layer of the rumen. \n They are hard to feel for, however, as they are much softer and pliable projections of the rumen than things like pimples or muscles. The papillae are round-shaped projections with a narrower base near the wall of the rumen, and are responsible for absorption and uptake of nutrients into the cow's bloodstream. \n There are two main contractions: primary and secondary. \n The primary contraction is the most pronounced and can be the most startling if you've never felt it before: the smooth muscle of the rumen contract in on themselves to mix digesta and microbes together to increase digestion ability. \n The secondary contraction is less defined and may be harder to notice until you've identified it after the 2nd or 3rd contractions. \n You may have to go in up to your shoulder, especially if you have short arms, to feel this. \n The esophagus is basically a "hole in the wall" with sphincter muscles, and is located above the reticulum into the rumen. \n The reticulum is always located in front of the rumen below the esophagus, and can be identified by feeling for the skin making a sudden peak from the rumen towards the front of the cow. \n \n If you are the last one to examine the cow, the plug must be replaced soon after to keep stomach contents from being expelled. The plug has to be placed so that it forms a tight impenetrable seal from the outside world to the rumen. \n It's often a lot harder to put the plug back in than to pull it out. It will take a bit of manipulation to put it back in properly. \n \n If you have only one hand that was gloved, take the glove off by taking the end of the glove at the shoulder and moving it down so that it turns itself inside out as you remove it. The latex glove will come off when you have the shoulder-length glove inside out already using your clean hand. \n If you have a second shoulder-length glove on, take the first one off like you would with any other glove, then with the other one, take it off at the shoulder and moving it down so it turns inside on itself and keeps the other dirty glove inside as well. \n Your OB suit will also be disposable and can be taken off and tossed as well. \n
 If you're new to an area, you can ask the county planning department whether your home is at risk for flooding.You can also check government sites for flood maps. Be sure to check back every so often; the maps are sometimes redrawn as conditions change.The main factor determining your risk is whether you are in a floodplain or not, which you can check with flood maps.Several other factors put you at risk for floods. For instance, if your main floor is below the base flood elevation in an area, you're at risk for flooding. You're also at risk if your near a body of water, such as a lake or a river. You're especially at risk near the ocean.\n That is, know the best ways in and out of your neighborhood and other areas of the city when it's flooded. You'll need to stick to higher ground if you need to evacuate. Also, have a planned meeting place for your family members if you get separated. Have the plan written down. Go over it together so everyone knows what to do.The best way to plan an evacuation route is to use flood maps, which will show where the worst flooding will be in your area.When planning your evacuation route, have an established place to go. For instance, you can set up a plan with a friend ahead of time to evacuate to his or her house, or go to your workplace if it is out of the flood zone. Many communities also have areas designated for emergencies where you can go. \n That is, show them the emergency numbers you have displayed in your home. Show them how to dial the numbers, and go over what they need to say in an emergency. Also, have a safety contact in the neighborhood that they can go to if they have a problem., Designate one person who is not in the immediate area as the person your family checks in with. That way, at least one person will have all the information who is not in immediate danger., When thinking about how you will evacuate, don't forget to include your pets in your plan. Have enough carriers for all your pets so that you can evacuate them with you if needed.Carries keep pets contained so you can evacuate them without harming them.Don't forget to include other items for your pets. They'll need containers for food and water, as well as food and their normal medications if you evacuate. Remember, not all emergency shelters will allow pets. Also, try to take something that will remind them of home, such as a toy or blanket.If you must stay in your home, move your pets to the highest point in the house with you., If possible, buy flood insurance so that you can recover from the damage of flooding. If you live in an area with low risk, insurance shouldn't be too expensive. If you live in an area with higher risk, it will be more expensive, but it will be worth it if flooding ever destroys your home. In fact, you are required to have it in a high risk area if you have a federally insured loan.You can get insurance through a federal program, the National Flood Insurance Program, by filling out forms on their website., For water, that means packing enough for each person to have a gallon per day. For food, pack non-perishable foods like canned goods that you don't need to cook. Keep these supplies in a waterproof container.Don't forget to include a can opener with your food, as well as some utensils for eating.Also, remember your pets need to eat and drink, too, so take them into account., You'll need a multipurpose tool that includes items like a screwdriver and knife. You also need extra phone chargers and a spare set of keys., Keep a first aid kit in your box, along with a supply of soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, shampoo, and other toiletry items. Antibacterial hand wipes are also good to keep on hand., These items can include things such as sunscreen, bug spray, emergency blankets, and rain boots., That is, have a weather radio with extra batteries. You'll also need to keep friends and family informed, as well, so remember to have emergency contact information on hand., As noted earlier in the article, you can ask the your county planning department about the frequency of flooding at a potential building site.If you have no choice about where you build and you're located in a flooding area, you need to build an elevated, reinforced house to protect against flooding., Your furnace, air conditioner, electrical unit, and hot water should all be lifted above the ground to keep them from being flooded.Also, electrical outlets and wiring should be a foot above any flooding that's likely.You should have a professional perform these tasks. \n Make sure you have copies of all of your insurance policies, pictures of your possessions and home, and any other important documents in a safe place. You either need to keep them in a waterproof box in your home or in a safety deposit box., A sump pump pumps out collected water, usually in basements. If you're home is prone to flooding, put one in your home, and be sure it has a battery back up in case your electrical goes out., These valves prevent flood waters from coming up drains., Have a professional evaluate your home and create barriers around your home that will prevent water from entering your house., If you have a basement, have the walls sealed with a waterproof sealer, which will help keep water out of that area., Turn on the weather radio for reports on flooding in the area so you can stay informed., If you have standing water, turn off the electricity by flipping the main breaker switch to your house's electricity. You should also turn it off if you plan to leave when there is flooding or if you see power lines on the ground., You should locate it ahead of time. Generally, you turn the handle a quarter of a turn until it is perpendicular to the pipe to shut off the gas. You'll need a crescent wrench to make the turn., Usually, you will need to turn a small valve to the right several times to turn it off., Wash the areas with a bleach solution, and rinse them clean. Fill them up to have clean water available to you. Also fill up any other pitchers or containers you have with water., If you have furniture or grills, bring them inside or tie them down to secure them., If you have enough warning, move any important items, such as electronics or valuable furniture to higher ground, such as upstairs or in the attic.
 How will you spend that money on the 23 positions available?\n On this list, have the most you are willing to pay for a player, and set yourself at that price. Don't go too hard after certain players because they play for your home team. \n $1 players are usually the backups, or subpar starters. \n A well-balanced team may leave you smack dab in the middle of the standings, unable to dominate in any particular statistic. \n Take the redeemers and reap the rewards. \n \n If your league has minor league and minor league picks, use those in your trades. \n Trade for categories you are in need of, not something you are already strong in. \n If you read the book, you realize Billy Beane is just running a de facto fantasy baseball team. Though you needn't overanalyze your fantasy team, general principles outlined in the book for picking players can be useful. Joe Shlabotnik's .350 batting average means diddly squat next year, because he can't walk and can't hit for power. Only fools would pick Shlabotnik high in next year's fantasy draft. \n Advanced statistics can be good as predictive tools, but in the end the league will likely be scored based upon more simplistic statistics. \n As the great P.T. Barnum once said, "there's a sucker born every minute.",and this applies even in fantasy baseball leagues. You will almost surely have someone in your league who insists on buying high and selling low and riding every player's short-lived wave of success for all it's worth. Use them to purchase players with high upside for nominal prices. \n 
 As soon as you find out your child will need to undergo surgery, find out as much about the surgery as you can - to give you some peace of mind, and so that your child can be informed about what's going on.While finding out as much as possible is best, try to find out at least the basics, which includes: \n When and where will the surgery take place? \n What does the surgery affect? How invasive is it? \n What's the typical recovery time? \n Is it common for patients to be in pain after the surgery? If so, what is the best treatment option for the pain? \n Will your child need to be temporarily admitted to the hospital? \n What are the procedures for you and your child before, during, and after the surgery? \n What are some things that you'll need to bring with you to the hospital (insurance information, emergency contact numbers, etc.)?\n No two children are alike, regardless of whether or not they're autistic, and you'll need to make sure that the doctor is aware of any potential medical afflictions that could cause complications with your child's surgery. Even if your child has no other health issues except for the one resulting in the surgery, you may need to tell the doctor about things like your child's contact lenses or any past surgeries or medical treatments. Oftentimes, you'll fill out a form detailing your child's medical history, but ask the doctor if there's anything else they need to know. \n Mention any health issues or requirements to their doctor. For example, if your child is prone to seizures, has any allergies, or has a medical condition such as diabetes, the doctor will need to know. \n Bring up pre- and post-surgery needs, too - for example, medications your child may need to take in the morning, or if their diet should change after the surgery. \n If your child is on any existing medications and will need to go on a new one after the surgery, work with the doctor to find a medication that won't potentially conflict with your child's existing medications. \n Autistic people may struggle with the change in environment or certain factors of the environment in the hospital, and the doctors and nurses want to help accommodate them and make them more comfortable. Ask about accommodations that your child could be given before and after their surgery, and during a hospital stay. A few examples of these accommodations are:Can your child be sedated before administering an IV? \n Is it possible to remove unnecessary equipment from the pre-operative room to prevent high anxiety? \n Could the doctors and nurses remove laboratory coats before entering the child's room? \n Would it be possible for very few people to come in at a time, to avoid scaring your child with the amount of doctors or nurses? \n If your child can reliably communicate, can your child speak or use AAC instead of you communicating for them? If they use AAC, what kind of AAC can they use? \n Could your child be in a post-operative room that does not have harsh, flickering, or buzzing lights? Can the lights in the room be dimmed, as an alternative? \n Can the nurses make sure you're in the room when your child wakes up? \n Could you and your child tour the hospital so that your child can be more familiar with the setting?Discuss comfort objects with the doctor as well. For example, you could say something like, "My child is autistic and needs to carry a stuffed fox to keep calm. Can we make sure that she has her fox when she falls asleep and when she wakes up?" \n Autistic people can have an unusual recovery time compared to neurotypical people,and even if your child recovers at the typical pace, they'll still need time to rest and recover. Do everything possible to avoid scheduling the surgery on a week that's busy for either you or your child, whether it's because of their school, your work, their therapy, or any outside activities that may potentially conflict with the surgery or the recovery period. \n There are four types of surgery - major surgery (such as to correct issues caused by birth defects), minor surgery (such as correcting a bone fracture), elective surgery (when you schedule the surgery beforehand), and emergency surgery (such as for a potentially fatal heart defect).Depending on the type of surgery, your scheduling options may be limited, or you may not be able to schedule it yourself. \n If the child's surgery can't wait until there's a break from school, then you will need to discuss your child's surgery with their teacher and school attendance. \n If you absolutely can't avoid scheduling their surgery when everyone is busy, then cancel any non-important events that you can, move your child's therapy appointments, arrange to pick up their schoolwork, and make sure that there's always an adult able to care for your child. Your child's recovery is more important than their speech therapy. \n Even if your child is nonverbal and never appears to be paying attention to you, they can still listen and understand what you're saying, and it's important that they know what's going on. While it's recommended to talk to toddlers and preschoolers early due to their limited concept of time, and to older children as soon as possible so that they have advance warning, consider your child's memory and skills at changing their routine when it comes to talking to them about the surgery. \n Try using social stories, a picture schedule of what will happen at the hospital, or reading age-appropriate books with your child about surgery, and exposing your child to the sort of equipment they may see while at the hospital with toy medical kits.The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has a slideshow for autistic children that explains what happens at the hospital, which can be accessed here. \n Be careful about the language you use. Don't say things like, "The doctor will cut you open", "You'll be put to sleep", or other language that may be associated with a scary or sad event. Instead, say things like, "The doctor is going to fix your stomach so that it won't hurt any more", or "They'll help you sleep for a few hours. When you wake up, I'll be there with you".Portray the hospital workers as kind and helpful people, not as people who will punish your child for misbehaving.If your child is a literal thinker, try to avoid using figurative language at all, to lessen the risk of confusion. \n Your child may be very frightened of the upcoming surgery and regress to younger behaviors or start using harmful stims. Be patient and be there for them. Remember that it's normal for any child to regress to younger behavior when under stress, and that they need your support and care right now. \n If your child is verbal or has access to complex AAC, encourage them to share their concerns with you. This can help you comfort your child about the things they feel worried about. \n Validate their feelings and make sure they understand that they aren't getting surgery as a punishment.Tell them that it's okay for them to cry and be scared.Try encouraging them to engage in therapeutic play, such as "playing hospital", before the surgery, to make the process more known and less scary. It will also help your child learn the routine of a hospital setting. \n Don't lie to your child to relieve their fear - they'll figure out that you were lying. If they ask if something is going to hurt, say something such as, "Yes, it will hurt, but it will be over quickly"., It's often recommended to feed your child soft "safe foods" after surgery, even if the surgery wasn't oral or gastrointestinal, and they're going to need some help managing their pain. Before your child's surgery, make sure that you purchase foods and pain relief medications, pick up any prescriptions, and any medical supplies that they may need (such as ice packs or bandages). Check with your child's doctor to see if there are any necessities. \n Your doctor may recommend getting over-the-counter drugs for your child's pain, such as Tylenol, or give you a prescription. Avoid aspirin-based OTC medications, and check with the doctor about whether ibuprofen is safe to use. \n Go shopping with your child, if they can handle it, to help them pick out foods and drinks that they'd like. \n Pick out clear liquids and smooth, bland foods for your child. Examples include non-textured ice cream, pudding, apple or white grape juice, soft noodles, soup broths, and applesauce. \n Your child may be disappointed that they can't eat foods that they normally would eat, or that they have to eat only bland or smooth foods. Empathize with them and remind them that once they feel better, they'll be able to return to their typical diet. \n Your child will most likely need rest afterwards, so find things they can do. A child who is hyposensitive to pain will need activities to help them stay resting, while a hypersensitive child may be in a lot of pain and will benefit from distraction. \n Stop by your local library for books and movies. \n Video games may or may not be appropriate, especially if you have a big-screen TV where your child can lie down while playing games. \n Consider buying your child a gift they can enjoy while relaxing, such as a new book about their special interest, or a relaxing video game. This will cheer them up. \n Hospital passports are a strategy used to help accommodate autistic children in the stress of a hospital environment. Write down your child's likes, dislikes, sensory sensitivities and cravings, communication methods and strategies, ways to help them adjust, and things that your child is interested in.This can help the doctors and nurses work with your child, and gives information to anybody who gets involved in the situation a bit later than anticipated. \n Try making a few copies of the hospital passport, so that you can give them to nurses. You can also put one in your child's suitcase if they need to be admitted. \n You may want to put other information, such as your child's medical history or emergency contact numbers, on the hospital passport. \n In the cases of some surgeries, your child may need to be admitted to the hospital while they recover to ensure that there are no complications. If your child will need to be admitted to the hospital, pack the bag with them, and tell them what you're packing. Pack them a bag that contains things such as:Clothes and/or pajamas \n Shoes or slippers \n Small travel-sized toiletries, such as shampoo \n Toothbrush and toothpaste \n Stim toys, preferably low-energy ones \n Objects or activities that the child enjoys, such as books, stuffed animals, or movies \n Preexisting medications - sometimes. Check with the hospital on whether to bring them. \n Be careful with bringing electronic devices. Some hospitals don't allow things like cell phones and tablets, and they're easy to lose or break. However, if your child needs an electronic device to communicate, talk with the hospital staff to see if they'll make an exception. \n Don't pack anything that you or your child would not want to get lost or broken, as things can get lost, damaged, or accidentally thrown away in the hospital. \n If your child has siblings, they'll need to be informed of the upcoming surgery and that your child will need to rest and recover. When discussing the surgery with the child's siblings, explain to them as much as they can understand, and encourage them to ask questions and express their emotions.Don't leave them in the dark about it, or they may become confused, scared, or betrayed - be upfront and honest. \n Siblings in particular may be feeling a range of emotions about your child's surgery, and may express them in ways such as acting out, trying to get attention (whether by constantly pestering you or pretending that they're sick), not eating or sleeping as much, withdrawing from friends or family, or requiring more attention than they used to.These are signs that they are under stress, and should be addressed. \n Your child's siblings may be worried about home life changing and them not being cared for as much. To combat these fears, set aside blocks of time for you to spend with your child's siblings, and keep the care routines as normal as possible. Offer extra encouragement and praise for them when they do good things., Your child's surgery will undoubtedly be stressful for you, too, and it's important to get support from others. Seek out help from friends, your parents or siblings (if possible), and/or your partner. If necessary, talk to a mental health professional about your fears. Don't let your fear and stress eat away at you. \n Remember, it's completely normal to be worried about your child during this time. You aren't being silly or having unjust fears. \n If you have friends or family members who have also had a child who has undergone surgery, ask if they can give you some advice. While techniques for neurotypical children may not work for autistic children, there's some advice that is universal, such as the type of comfort objects your child should have, or how to ease your worries during the surgery. \n In many cases, your child will not be able to eat or drink anything starting from midnight of the night of the surgery, so it's best to make them a meal that they'll eat a lot of. Make sure they drink enough, too. Encourage your child to eat as much as they'd like, and maybe give them a treat for dessert afterwards. \n Some surgeries require that your child is on a specialized diet before the surgery.If this is the case, then you're unfortunately not going to be able to follow this step, unless there's something in the restricted diet that your child especially enjoys. \n If your child has poor impulse control, hide the food away and stay with them to make sure they don't try and sneak food. If your child eats or drinks before the surgery, the surgery will have to be postponed or rescheduled.If your child needs to take medication in the mornings, discuss with the doctor whether or not they can take their medication on the morning of the surgery. \n This doesn't mean to put their clothes on for them if they don't need that kind of help, but to help them pick out clothing that is comfortable and won't get in the way. Choose clothing that is light, comfortable and can be easily slipped off, as they may have to change into a hospital gown. \n If your child wears contacts, encourage them to wear their glasses instead. \n Bring a jacket or sweater for your child. Hospitals are often cold. However, be careful with a sweater if you think your child will resist changing from their clothes to a hospital gown - it can be difficult to get them to take them off. \n If your child has long hair, encourage them to leave it down. Buns and high ponytails can interfere with the ability to rest their head comfortably on the pillow. However, low-hanging hairstyles (such as side ponytails or braids) can help keep your child's hair out of their face and look great as well. \n Autistic children often stim to express emotions or keep calm in stressful environments, and it's not considered unusual for children to carry around a comfort blanket, toy, or object. Allow your child to pick out something that they can carry with them for comfort, and request that the doctors and nurses don't suddenly take it from your child. \n It's best to take something big, rather than a small fidget toy, as these are less likely to be lost. \n Focus more on your child's comfort than whether the toy looks age-appropriate. It's okay for anyone of any age to be carrying around a big stim toy or stuffed animal if it helps them keep calm. \n You will probably not be able to leave the hospital while your child is undergoing the surgery, so bring things that can keep you occupied during the waiting period. Hospitals sometimes have reading material in waiting rooms, but consider bringing things like: \n Written games (crossword puzzles, Sudoku, etc.) \n Electronic devices, if they're permitted, and any chargers for these devices \n Work projects \n Books or magazines \n When your child is being checked into the hospital for their surgery, make sure to mention any health problems that your child may have, and bring up their needed accommodations to the nurses working with them. It can be helpful to the nurses to remind them of your child's needs, which, in turn, helps your child. \n Don't be afraid to bring up your child's autism. If your child will need extra support because of their autism, it's actually best to bring it up so that the nurses are aware and can give your child some extra support and accommodations. \n If you're bringing up your child's autism, say "autistic" or "autism" rather than "Asperger's" or "PDD-NOS". It's entirely possible the nurses aren't familiar with diagnoses of anything other than autism. \n Ask the nurses to avoid restraining your child under any circumstances to avoid panicking them. \n Since your child is under stress, it's quite possible that they may lose some of their abilities. Be extra patient with your child, and keep an eye out for things they might be struggling with. \n If you suspect your child may lose their verbal ability, bring a form of AAC that they can use. \n The stress may be especially overwhelming to your child if they get aggravated by sensory input, broken routines, or even just having not eaten for several hours. \n Do everything possible to help your child avoid a meltdown or shutdown. \n During the pre-surgery preparations, you and your child may need to wait, which can result in your child becoming anxious. Stay with your child and keep them company, and do whatever they find calming, whether that means that you don't say anything as they play with a stim toy or that you talk with them until the doctor arrives. \n Remind them that they will be okay, and that you'll be there when they wake up. \n If your child is in pain, do what you can to distract them from the pain. That can be anything from distracting them with a TV show on the hospital TV, to offering deep pressure through a hug or rubbing their back or hand. \n Help them redirect their stims if they begin using agitated and harmful stims. \n Many children are scared of needles and IVs, and it can be tough to get any child to cooperate with you when needles get involved. Distract them from the process by offering a stuffed animal, a stim toy or encouraging them to infodump while the IV is inserted. If your child is nonverbal, talk to them about a happy event or something that you know they really enjoy. \n If your child is receiving anesthesia or sedatives through a mask, they may try to pull the mask off their face. Talk to them throughout the process and try to hold their hands (but don't restrain your child). \n Never pin your child down - restraining your child will result in them becoming fearful or panicked and fighting you, and these practices have been proven to not be beneficial.All autistic children are different. A hyposensitive child may not even feel the IV going in, while a hypersensitive child may attempt to jerk away from the IV in fear. \n Many autistic children find comfort in having a familiar person nearby, and parents are often encouraged to stay with their children before the surgery process anyway. You don't need to talk to your child (though it's recommended, to calm them); just being in the room with them can be a big help. \n You will not be allowed in the operating room, which may frighten your child if they're still awake. Tell them that you'll be there when they wake up. \n When your child wakes up after their surgery, they'll likely be confused and disoriented. Talk softly to them and make sure they know you're there. It can take some time for your child to wake up fully, so be patient with how long it may take. \n Don't wake your child before they're ready, despite how much you might want to. They need rest, not only to heal faster, but to also allow administered pain medications to kick in.Some parents report their autistic child trying to pull the IV out of their arm.While the nurses are trained to deal with children doing this sort of thing, you may want to stay near your child during the wake-up process. \n When your child comes home, they're going to need different care than is normal for them, and you aren't going to be able to remember it all off the top of your head. You may either get this information during or after your child's surgery, but be sure that you receive post-operative care information in a written form so that you aren't left scratching your head in confusion when your child needs later treatment. \n Print-outs from the doctor detailing post-surgery care can be useful, if they're available. \n Take notes on how to treat your child's wound, what activity they can and can't engage in, what they should and shouldn't eat, who to call if there's an issue, who the follow-up appointment will be with, and what symptoms are and aren't normal. \n Write down the doctor's phone number in case you need to call them about your child's treatment. \n Many surgeries no longer require your child to stay for an extended period of time at the hospital to recover; however, some do, or there may be potential complications or health problems that result in the need for a longer stay. It's quite possible this will distress you and your child, especially if an unexpected event has resulted in the need for admittance, but keep it in perspective and explain it to your child. Remember, the hospital workers are trying to help your child get better, not take them away from you. \n Many hospitals will allow you to stay overnight with your child during their hospital stay. However, if that isn't the case, make sure they have comfort objects, enjoyable activities, and things that remind of them of home. \n If you need to leave the hospital while your child is there, tell them where you are going, why, and when you should be back.If you need to be gone for long periods of time, have another family member (such as your partner) stay with them. \n Consider creating a schedule for your child if they need to be in the inpatient ward for more than a day, so that they have a routine., Your child may still be very tired from the anesthesia, but even if they aren't, it's important to make sure they rest to help the healing process. For the first few days, encourage them to rest as much as possible and to only get up to use the bathroom, and to let you know when they need something that requires getting up. \n When your child wants to sleep, roll them onto their side. It's not uncommon for children to vomit after having been under anesthesia,and if they're on their side, they're much less likely to choke if they vomit in their sleep. \n Make sure your child is resting, even if they feel capable of performing normally. A hyposensitive child may try to go about their life as normal, which can potentially injure them or slow their healing. \n It's common for children to sleep more than usual for a few days after surgery, or to be wobbly and unsteady at first. Constipation, gas, urinary retention, nausea, sore throats or jaws, and dizziness are also common. These symptoms should wear off within a few days., If your child is still stressed out and is unable to communicate reliably, or if their surgery affected their mouth or throat, they may not be able to speak. Autistic children who can normally use one form of AAC may also need to temporarily regress to a simpler form of AAC while they recover. Pick out a form of AAC that would work best for your child, since they'll need to be able to communicate with you during recovery. \n A child of any age can try ringing a bell or pressing a button to call for you. \n The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), or cards with request words (e.g. "drink", "toilet", "lonely", "hurt") written on them, can be useful for requests or even expressing basic emotions, but can't be used for conversation. \n Communication boards can be used to express emotions and requests, but they can't be used for conversation. It can also be hard for a child to use them if the surgery or effects of anesthesia have affected their motor skills. \n Complex AAC apps, writing, and typing can work for school-age children who have developed enough fine motor skills to use them. \n Early on in the recovery process, it's discouraged to give your child solid foods, but it's still important to keep your child hydrated. Make sure they have clear liquids easily accessible to them - such as water, apple juice, ginger ale, or Popsicles- so that they stay hydrated. It may be a good idea to keep a sealed cup with a straw by your child's bed, so that there's less of a risk of your child accidentally knocking it over. \n If your child isn't vomiting, then you can try giving them a light meal, such as soup or crackers.Make sure that your child can tolerate the food's texture or flavor. \n Your child will probably not be able to do most things on their own, even if they're normally fairly independent. They may need round-the-clock care, or need to be checked on periodically. Make sure that your child is being cared for and checked on often enough, and that you're nearby so that they can call for you or otherwise get your attention. \n If you need to leave the room for a short amount of time, get another person to watch over the child, or give them an object such as a bell to ring if they need you. Older children who have cell phones can be advised to text you. \n Rotate caregivers. Maybe your spouse could watch over your child while you run out to the store or pharmacy, and your child's siblings could spend time playing board games with your child while you're making dinner. \n Bring your child their box of stim toys if they feel the urge to stim. \n Your child may need to take medications, use ointments, have a hot or cold compress applied to the surgical site, have bandages changed, or otherwise need special care. Be sure to follow these instructions to help your child heal and prevent infection or illness. \n Talk with the child while helping them with these procedures, so that they aren't caught by surprise and they understand what's going on. For example: "I'm going to put an ice pack on your neck now. It's going to be cold, but it will help your throat feel better and help you heal faster." \n Don't restrain your child during these processes, even if they struggle. It will just result in your child becoming fearful of these times. Work with them to find a way to make it manageable for them. If your child really will not cooperate no matter what you try, however, contact their doctor and ask if there's an alternative way of treating your child. \n Figure out who is in charge of the child's medicine, and make sure that everything is administered as instructed and according to schedule. Even if your child is older and more responsible, someone should be with them when they are taking their medicine, to make sure they are doing it correctly. \n Do not expect the child to keep track of their own medicine, even if they're normally able to. The exhaustion of surgery may make an otherwise-responsible child unable to reliably take medicine according to the doctor's orders. \n Try keeping a checklist to track what has been taken already. \n If your child is curious about things, they may want to explore the surgery site and its stitches. While you shouldn't discourage your child's curiosity, make sure they understand that they shouldn't touch the stitches or prod at the area around it. Tell them that if it itches, they need to not scratch, as it can break the stitches. Encourage them to learn about surgery by showing them age-appropriate books or websites about surgery and stitches. \n If you suspect that your child will pick at or excessively touch their stitches, put soft pads or gauze over the stitches to prevent them from pulling the stitches out. \n Be especially cautious if the surgery was in an area that might be frequently touched on a regular basis (e.g. their hand or mouth). Help your child with tasks that involve this area so that they don't accidentally injure themselves or reopen the wound. \n Pick pajamas and clothes for your child that are less likely to potentially rub against the surgery area and cause discomfort, or snag on stitches. \n Especially if your child's surgery requires an extended period of resting, it may be easy for them to get bored or restless, or they may want a distraction from the pain. Offer them activities that require minimal energy, such as: \n Watching TV or a movie \n Reading books \n Using a computer or tablet for games \n Coloring in a coloring book, or drawing \n Stimming with low-energy stim toys \n Engaging in their special interest, such as researching or using low-energy toys \n If your child is further along in the recovery process, it may be okay to give them some higher-energy activities or stim toys. However, don't allow them to engage in intensive activities, sports, roughhousing, or any other activity that may potentially injure your child., Surgery can be very painful and stressful for an autistic child, so spend time with them and calm them down. If your child is struggling emotionally, it can help to have a loved one nearby. \n Read to them. \n Have conversations, if they are up for it. \n Sit next to them while you do everyday things, like reading or fiddling with your phone. \n Offer cuddles if your child likes them. \n Hypersensitive children in particular may be extremely sensitive to pain and struggle with pain management after surgery. If distraction isn't enough, then you may need to administer pain medication, whether it's over-the-counter or prescription medication. Pain medications often exist in both liquid and pill form;choose what your child is capable of taking and tolerating, and follow the instructions on the prescription or on the post-surgery care instructions. Contact your child's doctor if your child is still in pain when the medication has kicked in. \n Recognizing pain in autistic children can be difficult, especially if they're hyposensitive or nonverbal. However, if your child seems extremely subdued or shows less interest in their activities than normal, is crying, is "protecting" the pained area, is expressing pain or making noises that suggest pain, is grinding their teeth, or is unable to use a part of their body (e.g. unable to stand after their leg was operated on), they may be in pain and need medication.Avoid giving your child ibuprofen or other NSAIDs unless their doctor says it's okay; these medications can cause stomachaches or diarrhea, and can cause potential health complications if your child has kidney issues, blood clotting or heart problems, or asthma.Check on your child's pain periodically. While some autistic children may have trouble using a plain 1-10 scale that's often used to describe pain, it may work to write down what the numbers would entail (for example, writing under 10, "I hurt so much that I can't focus on anything else"). It's best to give your child pain medication when the pain isn't extremely intense, since it can take longer for the medicine to take effect when the pain is extreme., If your child's school isn't on break, they'll most likely need to get the classwork and homework assignments that are being assigned. You or another caretaker of the child can pick up their homework and bring it home, or a friend or sibling who attends the same school can talk to your child's teacher and drop off the homework. It's best to not let it pile up until your child returns to school, since it can be immensely stressful to your child to receive a large stack of papers on a single day. \n Encourage your child to rest rather than do homework in the early days. Your child may be worrying about missing a lot of schoolwork, but after surgery, recovery is more important than schoolwork. It's often encouraged to prevent your child from doing heavy lifting (such as lifting backpacks or textbooks) after surgery, anyway. \n Use the internet to your advantage. Some teachers will offer homework assignments, lessons, or the daily schedule online, especially in the later grades. Others may be willing to send photocopies of the assignments over email. \n Depending on how long they are out of school, ask if they can record the day's lesson to review and catch up later. \n If your child has siblings, those siblings may get bored or frustrated more easily when your child is recovering from surgery, especially since your time has to be unequally divided between your children. To avoid your other children getting agitated or being unkind to your recovering child, involve them and have them help out and spend time with your child. Help them understand how your child is feeling and encourage them to play with and talk with your child to help them feel less lonely. \n Older siblings may be able to help out with some mild care tasks, while younger siblings can help by playing games with your autistic child. Both age ranges can come and get you if your child needs something. \n Don't overwhelm them with sibling time - just set up a block of time for your child's siblings to spend with them (e.g. half an hour every few hours) so that your autistic child doesn't feel lonely and that their siblings are more involved. Be prepared to cut the time short, too. \n Younger siblings may pester your autistic child about the surgery and why they can't do what they can normally do, which can be a source of frustration for your autistic child. Make sure your younger children understand that they should talk to you about the more technical aspects of the surgery and recovery, and leave the personal questions (e.g. "What was the hospital like?") to your child. \n Your child may take some time before they feel they're ready for more than just liquids, and that's okay. However, when they're ready, try serving the soft foods you bought to your child to adjust them to eating more solid foods. Don't force your child to eat if they don't feel ready, though - just make sure they get enough fluid intake.Stay away from giving them food that has to be heavily chewed, food that's very spicy, or something that could otherwise interact with the surgical area and dislodge a blood clot. \n Your child may reject foods that don't align with their sensory preferences, or refuse to eat things that they may eat when not under stress. Don't take it as a cause for alarm - it's normal for autistic children to refuse certain foods under stress, and eating enough is more important than eating well. \n It's normal for your child to be disoriented or slightly groggy after the surgery. Hypersensitive children may also report frequent and intense pain. However, most of these symptoms should wear off a from few days to a week after surgery; if your child is not showing any signs of improvement, speak with the doctor as soon as possible, as illness after surgery may indicate a serious problem. Contact the doctor immediately if you notice that your child has any of the following symptoms:Fever or chills \n Excessive bleeding (however, oozing blood on bandages is often normal) \n Persistent vomiting, lasting for several days \n Excessive swelling around the surgical site \n Signs of infection - extreme pain to the touch (more than what's typical for your child), leaking pus or drainage, redness, hot to the touch, or a bad smell \n Signs of a poor or allergic reaction to a medication \n Difficulty breathing \n Irregular heartbeat \n Signs of shock - dizziness, confusion, loss of consciousness, clammy skin, severe sweating, low to no urine output, chest pain, anxiety or agitation, blueish lips or nails, and a rapid yet weak pulse, As your child recovers from surgery, they'll begin to feel more capable of taking on certain tasks, like working on their schoolwork or getting back into sports or clubs. However, they'll still need to rest, since their body isn't finished healing yet. Make sure that your child doesn't overwhelm themselves with work, and encourage them to do their activities slowly and cautiously, even if they feel like they don't need to go slowly. \n Set up allotted time for your child to work on a given activity, such as working on their homework. When the time is up, encourage them to rest, or give them a low-energy activity to do, like watching their favorite movie. \n Make sure they take breaks from daily activities, even if they feel like they don't need them. Returning to normal activities before the healing process has completed can be detrimental to your child's health. \n The recovery process can be frustrating, upsetting, or painful for any child, and your child may be moody, distraught, or irritable while they're recovering. You may be frustrated, too, whether because your child is irritable or because the recovery process is stressful. Remember, though, that your child can't magically make themselves get better and that taking out your frustration on them will upset them and make them feel guilty or like they're burdening you. Do your best to be patient with your child during the recovery process, without snapping at them or doing actions that would otherwise upset them. \n Continue getting support from family and friends. You're allowed to be frustrated or upset, and you don't need to feel guilty about it; it just isn't the best idea to express that in front of your child. Talking to others gives you an outlet without potentially upsetting your child. \n Remind your child when they're frustrated that they will get better, and that it's okay for them to be upset or annoyed at the recovery process. If they're verbal and lash out at you, don't take it personally - many people say things they don't mean when they're aggravated or upset. \n It will be okay - your child will recover, even if it's not on the schedule that most people would expect, and they won't be in pain forever. Don't stress! \n 
 Set the parking gear and the brake. Block the wheels. Raise the front of the New Yorker with a jack(s) and support the car with jack stands. Remove the splash guards under each fender to reveal access to the mounts.\n Raise the jack only until it just begins raising the engine a very little, to mainly support the engine, but not to raise the vehicle at all. \n (If your mounts have a heat shield between the mount and engine, remove the nut or bolt from the bracket holding the heatshield, using your ratchet and socket. Remove the heatshield.) Keeping the nuts loosely screwed on to just a few bolt threads, on the bolts, keeps the mounts aligned until both are loosened -- retained to this same degree, held on loosely, on each side of the engine. \n \n Install the heat shield and its retaining bolts, if your vehicle is so equipped (on the 3.5-liter engine, for example). \n Snug the nuts and bolts on all both mounts, at first only "finger tight". Then snug them all a little. \n The large nuts and bolts might be torqued to about 45 to 50 foot (13.7 to 15.2 m) pounds. The smaller bolts on the transmission mount are torqued less, perhaps to about 20 to 30 foot (6.1 to 9.1 m) pounds. \n Raise the front of the vehicle enough to remove your jack stands or blocks and such, and lower your New Yorker to the ground. \n 
 And just like anything we do in life, fear comes from ‘not knowing’. So imagine what you could accomplish if you could perform home wiring safely and confidently. Imagine saving thousands of dollars over the years, if you could do-it-yourself!\n It’s very important that you do not get in a hurry. Make sure that you have planned your project adequately, and that you’ve allowed plenty of time to complete your project, or at least if you have to pull off of it and come back to it later, that you find a suitable stopping point, and that you can do without the circuit that you’re working on. \n It’s not only dangerous. It is lethal. Shut the power off to any circuit that you are working on. (This means turn the power off at the circuit breaker panel. Just switching off a wall switch does not turn off the power in the wires.) Confirm the power is off with a simple pocket tester, a multi-meter, or lamp, blow dryer or another similar appliance. \n Fiberglass ladders are non-conductive. Don’t use an aluminum ladder. Spend the money for a good fiberglass stepladder. \n Never work barefoot or in socks or slippers, and don’t assume that it’s safe to work without rubber-soled shoes on concrete floors. Concrete is conductive, particularly when it’s damp (a good reason to never load or unload your washing machine while you’re barefoot). \n Even if by definition it’s called an insulator. (A conductor allows the flow of electrons, and an insulator resists the flow of electrons). \n OSHA requires us as contractors to lock it off, and tag it out with a procedure called lock out/tag out. It involves red tags and devices that will lock the breaker off to prevent it from being turned on. (If you have your panel cover off, remember that even when you turn breakers off, there are still energized components in the panel itself!). \n or “Danger�?, or something similar, so anybody who approaches that panel will see that, and immediately know what’s going on. \n Put your other hand either in your pocket or behind your back, and that’s a good practice to develop anyway. What that does is keeps you from grabbing a circuit with two hands and providing a path for the electricity to flow through your heart. \n It is well worth spending a little extra money to purchase quality tools. I’m referring to hand tools like your lineman pliers, screwdrivers, wire strippers, and other hand tools that you will use for electrical work. For instance, Good wire strippers will prevent you from nicking or skinning the wires. Good screwdrivers will prevent slipping out of screw heads or rounding them out. You get my point; good tools not only improve the quality of your workmanship, but improve your confidence as well. So don’t skimp on tools. You can stock your tool pouch with good quality tools for $100 or less. \n 
 Although you can stack cakes of any shape, traditional layer cakes are round. 8 or 9 inch (20.3 or 22.9 cm) round pans work best.\n Layer cakes often bring together complimentary cake and frosting flavors. You may want to combine lemon with vanilla or chocolate with raspberries. \n Use butter, eggs and water at room temperature. Set the on the counter for about an hour before baking., If you are just learning how to assemble a layer cake, save some time by buying cake mix and pre-made frosting. \n Take it out of the oven for 10 minutes. Then, loosen it from the pan and place the cake on a baking rack to cool all the way. \n Test the cake by inserting a toothpick into the center. If it comes out clean, your cake is done. \n Place them in the refrigerator or freezer overnight. If you are short on time, do it for at least a few hours. \n A cold cake is easier to frost., You can trace the cardboard and cut it out or buy a round cake platform at a kitchen or craft store. \n If you don’t want to use a platform, slide pieces of parchment paper underneath the cake before you frost to cover your cake stand. Remove them before you serve the cake. \n Any thick, buttercream-like frosting should work. To make a quick version at home, mix together three cups (360g) powdered sugar and one cup softened butter. \n Add one tsp. (5ml) vanilla extract and one to two tbsp. (15 to 30ml) of whipping cream once the mixture has been creamed. Beat in your mixer on medium speed for five minutes altogether., Unwrap the first one. Set it atop the platform. \n Make sure they are no higher than your shortest cooked cake. If the batter was not poured to exactly the same amount, one cake may be shorter than the others. \n You can also cut each cake into two cakes if they are thick enough. \n You may want to measure and mark the cake with a frosting dab if you aren’t confident you can cut in a straight line. Ensure saw through the domed top of the cake very gently. \n If your cakes came out of the oven very level, you can skip the step of cutting them flat. \n Use an offset spatula and start with a big clump of frosting in the middle. Work the frosting out just past the sides of the layer. \n Then, set the second layer of cake on top of the frosting. \n Stack layers of frosting and cake until you have reached the top of your cake. Remember the more layers you have, the more frosting you will need to make. \n It’s easier to judge the amount of frosting you are using if you frost near eye level. \n Frost it to the edges. \n Be generous with your frosting. Finish one section before turning the Lazy Susan and moving onto the next section. \n Wipe off excess frosting with your spatula. Cover with an even coat of frosting and then place your cake in the refrigerator for a few hours. \n Remove it from the refrigerator and frost with a fresh coat layer of buttercream., Serve. \n 
\n When VBA works with data, execution speed is partially a function of the number of bytes that VBA has at its disposal. Thus, the fewer bytes used by data, the faster VBA can access and manipulate the data. \n The Decimal data type is rather unusual because you can’t actually declare it. It is a subtype of a variant. You need to use the VBA CDec function to convert a variant to the Decimal data type. \n The following list contains some examples of assignment expressions that use various variable types. The variable names are to the left of the equals sign. Each statement assigns the value to the right of the equals sign to the variable on the left. \n DataEntered = True \n DateStart = #04/18/2015# \n Interest_Rate = 0.025 \n LoanAmount = 2000000.00 \n MyNumber = TheNumber * 1.25 \n UserName = “Terrence O'Malley” \n x = 10 \n x = x + 1 \n If you attempt to use one of these words, you get an error message. For example, although the reserved word Next or True might make a very descriptive variable name, the following instructions generate a syntax error: Next = 64; True = True., If an instruction produces a strange error message, check the VBA Help system to ensure that your variable name doesn’t have a special use in VBA. If the Auto Syntax Check option is turned on you get the error: Compile error: Expected: variable. If Auto Syntax Check is turned off, attempting to execute this statement results in: Compile error: Syntax error. It would be more helpful if the error message were something like Reserved word was used as a variable., For integer calculations, you can use the Integer type which is limited to values less than or equal to 32,767. Otherwise, use the Long data type. Using the Long data type even for values less than 32,767 is recommended, because this data type may be a bit faster than using the Integer type. When dealing with Excel worksheet row numbers, you want to use the Long data type because the number of rows in a worksheet exceeds the maximum value for the Integer data type., Data stored as a Variant changes type, depending on what you do with it. \n The following procedure demonstrates how a variable can assume different data types: \n Sub VariantDemonstration() \n TheVar = “124” \n TheVar = MyVar / 2 \n TheVar = ”Answer: ” & TheVar \n MsgBox TheVar \n End Sub \n In the VariantDemonstration procedure, TheVar starts out as a three-character string. Then this string is divided by two and becomes a numeric data type. Next, TheVar is appended to a string, converting TheVar back to a string. The MsgBox statement displays the final string: Answer: 62. \n To further demonstrate the potential problems in dealing with Variant data types, try executing this procedure: \n Sub VariantDemonstration2() \n TheVar = “124” \n TheVar = TheVar + TheVar \n TheVar = ”Answer: ” & TheVar \n MsgBox TheVar \n End Sub \n The message box displays Answer: 124124. This is probably not what you wanted. When dealing with variants that contain text strings, the + operator performs string concatenation. \n Here’s a modified version of the previous procedure. This version displays the data type of TheVar at each step. \n You see that it starts out as a string, is then converted to a double, and finally ends up as a string again. \n Sub VariantDemonstration3() \n TheVar = “124” \n MsgBox TypeName(TheVar) \n TheVar = TheVar / 2 \n MsgBox TypeName(TheVar) \n TheVar = “Answer: “ & TheVar \n MsgBox TypeName(TheVar) \n MsgBox TheVar \n End Sub \n A user-defined data type can ease your work with some types of data. \n For example, if your application deals with customer information, you may want to create a user-defined data type named CustomerData: \n Type CustomerData \n Company As String \n Contact As String \n RegionCode As Long \n Sales As Double \n End Type \n Usually, you define an array. For example: \n Dim Customers(1 To 100) As CustomerData \n Each of the 100 elements in this array consists of four components (as specified by the user-defined data type, CustomerData). \n You can refer to a particular component of the record as follows: \n Customers(1).Company = “Ace Tools” \n Customers(1).Contact = “Tim Roberts” \n Customers(1).RegionCode = 1 \n Customers(1).Sales = 150000.00 \n You can also work with an element in the array as a whole. For example, to copy the information from Customers(1) to Customers(2), use this instruction: \n Customers(2) = Customers(1) \n The preceding example is equivalent to the following instruction block: \n Customers(2).Company = Customers(1).Company \n Customers(2).Contact = Customers(1).Contact \n Customers(2).RegionCode = Customers(1).RegionCode \n Customers(2).Sales = Customers(1).Sales \n You refer to a specific element in the array by using the array name and an index number. For example, you can define an array of 12 string variables so that each variable corresponds to the name of a month. If you name the array MonthNaming, you can refer to the first element of the array as MonthNaming(0), the second element as MonthNaming(1), and so on, up to MonthNaming(11)., You can also specify the number of elements in the array. You do so by specifying the first index number, the keyword To, and the last index number — all inside parentheses. \n For example, here’s how to declare an array comprising exactly 100 integers:\ \n Dim TheArray(1 To 100) As Integer \n \n Therefore, the two statements that follow have the same effect: \n Dim TheArray(0 to 100) As Integer \n Dim TheArray(100) As Integer \n In both cases, the array consists of 101 elements. \n If you would like VBA to assume that 1 is the lower index for all arrays that declare only the upper index, include the following statement before any procedures in your module: Option Base 1, VBA arrays can have up to 60 dimensions, although you’ll rarely need more than three dimensions (a 3-D array). \n The following statement declares a 100-integer array with two dimensions (2-D): \n Dim TheArray(1 To 10, 1 To 10) As Integer \n You can think of the preceding array as occupying a 10-x-10 matrix. To refer to a specific element in a 2-D array, you need to specify two index numbers. For example, here’s how you can assign a value to an element in the preceding array: \n TheArray(3, 4) = 125 \n A dynamic array doesn’t have a preset number of elements. \n Dim TheArray() As Integer \n Before you can use a dynamic array in your code, however, you must use the ReDim statement to tell VBA how many elements are in the array. You can use a variable to assign the number of elements in an array. \n Often the value of the variable isn’t known until the procedure is executing. For example, if the variable x contains a number, you can define the array’s size by using this statement: \n ReDim TheArray (1 to x) \n You can use the ReDim statement any number of times, changing the array’s size as often as you need to. When you change an array’s dimensions the existing values are destroyed. If you want to preserve the existing values, use ReDim Preserve. For example: \n ReDim Preserve TheArray (1 to z) \n 
\n \n Address: <input type="text" id="inputTextAddress" style=" width:200px" title="Address to Geocode"> \n \n <input type="button" onclick="codeAddress()" id="inputButtonGeocode" style="width:150px" title="Click to Geocode" value="Click to Geocode"> \n \n var geocoder\n \n geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder()\n It will not have any values passed to it. \n function codeAddress() { } \n \n var sAddress = document.getElementById(" inputTextAddress").value\n The first is the GeocoderRequest, this says what kind of request is being made and what the request value is. The second is the callback function that will be used to process the results. \n geocoder.geocode( { 'address': sAddress}, function(results, status) { })\n Use an IF statement to test the result, check to see if the status equal google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK. Also add an ELSE clause to the IF statement as well. \n if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) { \n } \n else{ \n } \n You will pass this method to get the result's first geometry location. \n map.setCenter(results.geometry.location)\n Create a new variable – we'll call it oMarker – it will be created as a new google.maps.Marker. The new method takes two parameters, the first is the map object that you're adding the marker to, and the second is the position to place the marker, which is again the first results geometry location. \n var marker = new google.maps.Marker({ \n  map: map\n  position: results.geometry.location \n })\n You can use the status to give a bit more information rather than just saying that it didn't work. \n alert("Geocode was not successful for the following reason: " + status)\n Type in an address, or simply a city and state, or even something as simple as a state name! You'll see the map move to the new location and add a marker to the map! \n The live page for this example can be viewed and used through a link from the sources and citations area if you scroll down! \n 
 These stages could more accurately be described as cycles. You may skip stages, never experience other stages, and you can find yourself stuck in stages. But you may experience some or all stages in waves repeatedly. These stages are:Denial and isolation: This stage involves denying the reality of the situation. It is a natural response to overwhelming pain caused by grief. \n Anger: This stage emerges once the denied pain starts to surface. Anger can be aimed at inanimate objects, strangers, family or friends. You may feel angry at the person who died or left, and then you may feel guilty for feeling angry. \n Bargaining: In this stage, you may feel like you need to regain control from feeling helpless. You might worry about how you should have been a better person, or you should have gotten help sooner, and so on. \n Depression: This stage brings sadness and regret that comes with the realization that the loved one is truly gone. You may feel overwhelming sadness, crying, and so on. \n Acceptance: This stage may be characterized by reaching a state of calm and withdrawal. Some people may never reach this stage of grief.\n The relationship has, in fact, died. Therefore, it is okay to feel as though someone precious has died. You are entitled to feel your loss. Ride the waves of grief without getting pulled under or lost in them. Don’t fight them. Recognize them for what they are: waves of emotion that will take you through some strange currents for a season all the while giving your heart space to heal. Grief is part of healing. \n Even if no one else in your life knows what you are experiencing, you can still acknowledge your own pain to yourself. When you feel down, take a moment and say, “I’m sad, and it’s okay. It gets better.” \n While those around you may not understand the depth of what you are feeling, don’t be afraid to share your grief with a couple of people you know you can trust. \n If you are concerned that you may be grieving unhealthily or that you are depressed, you may want to seek professional help. A therapist can help you understand your grief and whether you are becoming depressed. \n Read “How to Get Rid of Depression” to better understand depression. \n It can be useful to talk with a therapist even if you’re not depressed. A therapist can help you understand how to work through your grief. \n The old adage “time heals all wounds” is true.However, healing is promoted by realistically facing the emotion and giving yourself time to recover. We may want a quick fix, but ultimately quick fixes don’t exist where real love did. Accept the healing time offers and commit to not rushing yourself. \n Tackle that mountain of time in small bites. You can push the pause button on planning long-term goals. This is truly a time for one day at a time. \n You may still feel pain, but you may soon notice that it is less intense. Recognize the monumental step of healing for what it is. It’s a promise of better days. \n Find the balance that is healthiest for you of allowing sad moments while letting in new happy ones. When a wave of negative emotion hits, give yourself a moment (literally maybe just a single minute) to feel what you feel. Then, choose to move your thoughts on to something more positive. \n For the record, it’s okay to laugh when grieving. Your emotions are merely recalibrating. Believe it or not, your emotions are doing exactly what they should be doing. That said, sometimes the recalibration process hits a snag and we may find ourselves dealing with depression, which is a serious matter. \n Once you get over the initial grief of losing this person, it is a good time for a truthful look at your former relationship. Start by recognizing what existed. If you have lost the loved one because of death and are trying to move forward with your life, you may discover that you have idealized your relationship with your loved one, overlooking the times that weren’t so great in favor of the times that were. You are not dishonoring your loved one by recalling these less than ideal times. You are, instead, remembering the real and true person. If love existed between you, then part of what made the love so special was all of the in-between moments, and the ways you were able to work through differences. \n Don’t place this person unnecessarily on a pedestal in death. Holding him up so high can keep you from holding him close in your heart and moving forward, which is not what he wanted for you. \n If, your loss was relational rather than from someone passing, the same applies. Your relationship was not perfect. If it had been, you wouldn’t be trying to move on. Even if they were the one to cut things off, it still reveals some frailty to the relationship, and that is okay. \n Your relationship, like most, probably had a series of high and low moments. If you were not the one to end the relationship, you may find yourself idolizing it a bit. It is okay to look back and remember the good times. But it’s important to be realistic. There were not-so-good times as well. \n Appreciate the positive aspects of the relationship, and how the other person contributed to who you are now. \n It’s important to acknowledge the characteristics of the relationship that brought out the worst of you. This doesn’t mean that the other person was bad. But it can show you that there were some toxic elements when you were together. \n Once you have recognized these toxic elements, you can appreciate the chance to “detoxify” a bit. This will give you a chance to work on avoiding those pitfalls in other relationships. It will also help reframe your perspective of what you have lost. It helps you to give it a proper place in your thinking so you are free to move on. \n Being honest about the relationship and the other person is important in reconciling your current emotions and your attempt to let go and move on. But it is important to avoid vilifying the other person, even if he treated you poorly. Too much dwelling on the past can be harmful.Assigning negative connotations or dwelling on particularly darker moments can strengthen emotional ties to the thoughts of that person, making them hard to let go. In fact, your love can turn to resentment. This doesn’t free the person from your heart. It only frees him from your kindness. You deserve to be totally free to move on, so be cautious about giving him even the negative pieces of your heart. \n Isolation is normal and okay for a short time. But it is vital that you don’t isolate yourself from your closest supports for more than a short time. They love you and need to know you are alright. They know you better than you do yourself at times. They can help you get back to who you are at your best. \n These are the people who know how to be silent with you and know when to push you to step out and have fun. They know how to make you laugh, and they are supportive when you need to cry. You don’t have to let everyone in, but trust those closest to you. \n These people can also help you recognize if your grief goes into depression and if you need professional supports. \n Your friends and family might tread over the topic of the other person without realizing how much you are struggling. It is okay to let friends know when you need a change of subject. Just be honest and let them know that you need time. Be specific about what hurts you and what you would like to avoid for the time being., It’s important to know your pain threshold and protect yourself. Perhaps you agreed to be friends with your former loved one, but the “friendly” phone calls are painful. Be honest about how you’re feeling. You may need to totally separate while you give yourself time to heal. \n Most likely you have coworkers, classmates, or even friends and family who are just outside of the “close supports” category. They may not be the ones you spill your guts to, but they still play a part in your life. It is perfectly fine to turn down your coworker’s invitation to lunch for a spell, but then it will be time to let these people be the lighthearted, friendly, distraction-from-life they were before. \n These supports generally come with natural boundaries you have already established. You tend to avoid deeply personal conversation, and keep things fun and on the surface. They won’t expect you to trudge into emotional trenches over your 30-minute lunch break. \n This isn’t about replacing what was lost. Rather, it’s about moving on. Once you find yourself dealing less and less with your grief, you find your mind less preoccupied with the person you’re letting go of. Now it is time to be open to new people. New people are exciting.You do not, under any circumstances, have to get out there and date in order to move on. In fact, even thinking that way may terrify you at the moment. So let’s dial back the intensity and reframe this in a comfortable way. Instead of diving into the dating scene, dive into the possibility of new friendships. Friendships can take on so many wonderful forms. Some friends are more like family. Sometimes friends move past friendship and become romantic partners. Sometimes friends simply remain friends. Regardless of where a new friend fits, you can’t go wrong by being open to having more of them. \n Emotions can overwhelm and even silence a person. It is time to find your voice. Talk things over with a family member, friend, counselor or minister. \n There are times when something is so personal that it can be hard to open up to those who know us. You may consider making an appointment with a counselor or clergy member. Feelings have a way of jumbling up, making them difficult to articulate. An objective third party individual can help by asking you the right questions to untangle your emotions without inserting their own opinions. \n The important part here is to simply start talking, rather than getting stuck in your own head where there is no one to help validate or correct your thoughts. \n Write a letter to your loved one. Then, let it go to signify your own mental choice to let him go. Some people find it cathartic to burn their letter, signifying a definitive end. Or you may prefer something more considerate of the place this person will always hold in your heart. This may be more appropriate if you are letting go because this person has passed. \n You might prefer placing your message in a helium filled balloon and setting it free. \n Another option is creating a sky lantern with words of love written on it and sending it off as though mailing your loved one. \n You may also choose to journal your feelings. Give space to the feelings you feel now, as well as the ones you hope to restore.Journaling allows you to be completely honest with yourself because your words are for your eyes only. \n This practice also helps you to identify patterns in your thinking, your actions and behavior. \n Changing even the slightest thing in your life can help you feel refreshed and remind you that life is still fun. Rearrange your furniture. Try a new haircut. Drive a different way to work. Eat dessert first. Whatever you choose to change, no matter how small, pick something enjoyable. It may only be a temporary mood lifter, but that may be all you need to remind yourself that you can still smile and enjoy life. \n You’ve grieved and you’ve used your time to honestly consider the relationship. You have learned to honor your emotional limits as well as to challenge them. You have begun to let people in and you have found your voice. Now it is time to move on. Honor your loved one’s life by living your own. His love impacted you because of how he lived, not how he died. Continue his legacy of love and live by giving yourself to the paths of love and life in front of you. \n Too often, people allow their grief to drain them of the best characteristics they shared with the one who passed. Instead, let their love with you continue on by allowing them a happy place in your memories. Learn to smile again and laugh again when recalling your loved one. They can continue to bring you joy in those memories. Humor heals., While it is important to give yourself time to heal from the broken relationship, at some point you will feel ready to let someone else in. However, you don’t want to be the one carrying old baggage into a new relationship, whether the relationship is friendship or romantic. Think about whether you are free from thoughts about this former love. If you still think of him even a couple of times a day, then you could still find yourself in a rebound relationship. Even rebound friendships can be a problem because you are experiencing a temporary gap in your emotional needs and may be gravitating to someone who fills that need. But this relationship will not likely be a good overall fit. In fact, he truly may have nothing else to offer you. \n Are you able to go to places you used to frequent with your former love and not immediately think of him? If your world still screams his name, then you probably need more time. \n Until you are ready, it is okay to avoid places that still sting of the person you are learning to let go of. But keep in mind that pain is layered. While avoidance is okay in the beginning, eventually you’ll want to challenge yourself to heal completely. Consider revisiting old venues with a trusted friend. Then you can start to create new memories and associations. Start with where you are comfortable, and slowly begin to rewrite your own memories and stories. Those places can still be special. \n When that one song comes on the radio, do you still think of that person? If so, it may be too early to move on. You may need to reclaim that memory by tying it to new experiences. Try sharing the song with your friends and ask them to help you give it new meaning. Make it funny. Remember, humor heals. \n If you love the view from a certain restaurant, then meet a few of your best friends there. Laugh, enjoy yourself and start connecting that place to joy again. Peel back the layers bit by bit, and give them new and positive meanings in your life. \n When someone says your former loved one’s name, do you still feel a stab of pain? When you notice that feeling of pain, remind yourself that you wish him well. It may seem silly, but this can help reprogram your automatic thoughts about that person. \n If you were to run into your former love with his new love, how strong would your emotional reaction be? Would seeing him happy feel hurtful for you? Are you free to be happy for him? Have you let him go? \n A little bruising is to be expected, and like a physical wound, you may be healed, fully functional and ready to get back out there. Just make sure it’s no more than a little bruise before you do. \n 
 \n Move your hands slightly away from your face and flick your index fingers outwards and upwards. This signifies the way your face looks when you are surprised. \n It should be made into the 'modified bent hand' position. \n Bend your fingers twice towards the palm of your hand as if you were waving. \n Turn it sideways and place the side without your thumb on your cheek. \n Move your fist forwards and backwards slightly. \n \n Cross your arms over your chest in an 'x' shape. \n Your palm should be facing inward. \n Move it upward a few times. To sign excited: Spread your fingers apart, close to your chest. \n Point your middle fingers inwards toward you, still keeping your fingers spread apart--the middle fingers will be facing you, the others will face outward. \n Flick each hand, one at a time up off your chest a couple times, making sure that only your middle finger is actually touching your chest. The movement of each hand will almost look circular. \n \n Take your other hand and lay it flat on the top of the fist, in a modified '5' handshape. \n Move the hand on top downward so that it pushes the fist down. \n \n Slowly let them go downward. \n To sign disappointed: Make a 'd' sign with one of your hands. \n Place your index finger on your chin. \n \n Turn one of your hands in half a circle forwards and backwards as the other hand turns the opposite direction as the first hand. \n \n Turn it back and forth once or twice. \n To sign shame: Keep your hands flat and your fingers together. \n Place the back of the hand on your cheek and flick it out. \n To sign guilt: Make a 'g' sign and hold it on the side of your chest near the opposite arm. \n \n Alternatively, you could make the 'b' sign and tap the back of your hand against your face twice. \n \n Tilt it a little over to the side and put your index finger next to your mouth. \n Slide your hand downward. \n To sign doubt: \n Make a 'thumbs up' sign and turn it sideways. \n Make small circles going forward with the sideways thumbs up. \n \n Hold them next to your eyes with them facing downward. \n Move them up and down in small motions. \n To sign fear: \n Keep your hands flat and spread your fingers apart. \n Hold your hands up to your chest. \n Shake them from side to side, almost like you are shaking in fear. \n To sign embarrassed: \n Keep your hands flat and hold them up to your face. \n Slightly move them back and forth. \n \n To sign bother/annoy: Keep your fingers together but stick your thumb out. Do this with both hands. \n Turn one hand on its side. \n Take the other hand and, with the side of the little finger, tap in between the thumb and index finger on the other hand a couple of times. \n To sign mad: Make your hand into a clawing position. \n Place your hand over your mouth and nose or just your mouth. \n To sign anger: Make your hands into clawing positions. \n Place them onto your chest. \n Flick your hands to the sides. \n 
 There are two types of templates, the default and your custom. Creating a custom site template will be addressed later. Just know that you need to have it enabled when you save a site as a template. \n For your default templates that you can create out of the box, you need to get into the site definition files. For this example, go into local drive:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\60\TEMPLATE\1033\STS\LISTS\DOCLIB, but remember you need to do this in the other doclib folders in 1033.\n The first four lines of code are: \n <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> \n <!-- _lcid="1033" _version="11.0.6451" _dal="1" --><!-- _LocalBinding --> \n <List xmlns:ows="Microsoft SharePoint" Name="Documents" Title="Shared Documents" Direction="0" Url="Shared Documents" BaseType="1"> \n Now all the sites you create will come with shared documents version controlled. But what about when you create a new document library in an existing site. Well, there is an answer for that too. \n \n <TD class="ms-authoringcontrols" nowrap> \n <input tabindex=1 id=onetidVersioningEnabledYes type="radio" tabindex="1" value="TRUE" <strong>checked</strong> Name="VersioningEnabled" title="Create a version each time you edit a file in this document library: Yes"> \n <LABEL FOR="onetidVersioningEnabledYes">Yes</LABEL> \n </td> \n <TD class="ms-authoringcontrols" nowrap> \n <input tabindex=1 id=onetidVersioningEnabledNo type="radio" tabindex="1" value="FALSE" Name="VersioningEnabled" title="Create a version each time you edit a file in this document library: No"> \n <LABEL FOR="onetidVersioningEnabledNo">No</LABEL></td> \n 
 Turkeys come in various sizes, so you will want to pick a turkey whose size can feed the number of people you plan to serve. \n The rule of thumb is to buy 1 pound of turkey for every person you plan to serve. However, this does not allow for leftovers. If you would like to have leftovers, then you should plan to buy 1 ½ pounds of turkey per person.For example, if you want to serve eight people without leftovers, then you should buy an 8-pound turkey. However, if you want to have leftovers after serving those eight people, then you should buy a 12-pound turkey.\n It is important to avoid contaminating the turkey, so before beginning to gut it, you should be sure to thoroughly clean your work space. \n Use an antibacterial cleaning agent to wipe down the counter, and be sure that any other tools you plan to use, such as a cutting board and knives, are also cleaned with antibacterial dish washing liquid. Alternatively, you can wash down these surfaces and tools with hot, soapy water.Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds prior to handling the turkey. Also be sure to wash under your fingernails, if necessary. \n Make sure that you have all necessary materials that you will need for gutting the turkey either on your person or within reach. \n Cutting board \n Knife or knives \n Bowls \n Gloves (note: latex-free gloves would be a good option, due to latex allergies in some people) \n Apron \n \n This step is only necessary if your turkey still has the neck. If it does not, you can skip this step and move onto the next. \n Do this carefully, since you have already made one cut in the turkey. Flipping the turkey over prepares you to make the cuts that will enable you to pull out all of the innards safely. \n \n Take care while making this cut so that you do not puncture any of the innards.\n Some organs will be able to be kept and cooked as offal, which is highly nutritious. These include the heart, liver, and gizzard.Other organs will have to be disposed of in a proper way. \n This loosens the intestine so that you can pull it out, along with the other digestive organs.You need to take care while doing making this cut because the digestive juices inside these organs will break down any meat on the turkey if they touch it. \n These are not organs that can be kept to cook, so set them aside in their own bowl to await proper disposal after you finish gutting the turkey. \n Again, this step is only necessary if your turkey has a neck. \n You can pull out these parts through the pelvis, since they are loosened from the neck.Alternatively, you can pull these parts directly from the neck after you have made a slit., The crop refers to the sac in the turkey's breast that stores the food it was eating.A store-bought turkey likely no longer has its crop, but it would be worthwhile to verify. \n Cut a slit in the turkey where the neck meets the chest and carefully pull it apart. Inside, you should see the crop. Clean it out completely., Be sure to use strong water pressure to rinse the turkey well, inside and out. \n It is important to remove any remaining blood and lung tissue before preparing the turkey for cooking.Use cool water in order to avoid bacteria growth, which will happen with heat. \n Seal your turkey in a turkey roasting bag or a shrink wrap bag in order to store it.Only keep it in the refrigerator for a day or two before cooking; if it will be weeks or months before you plan to cook it, it should be stored in the freezer until you are ready. \n You must again use antibacterial cleaning agents or hot, soapy water to clean all of your work space and tools, such as the knives and bowls. Wash your hands with warm, soapy water again to rid them of any bacteria. \n When you gutted the turkey, you set aside its innards in different bowls based on whether they could be cooked later or needed to be disposed of. \n Gizzard \n Heart \n Liver \n Neck, if you have it on your turkey, can also be cooked and served., Depending on how quickly you plan to cook and serve the giblets, the freezer is likely the better option.If you plan to cook the giblets within a day or two, then wrap them securely in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store them in the refrigerator until you cook them. \n If you want to save them longer term, wrap them in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store them in the freezer. It is also a good idea to put them inside a freezer-safe bag for extra protection, up to four months. \n Be sure to get these items into the freezer before the “best by” date on the turkey's wrapping. \n If you have a cat or dog all parts of the turkey that you won't use can be fed to them, or you can give them to your pet owning neighbor. \n Otherwise, place the remaining innards in a trash bag for disposal. It would be best to double-bag these parts in order to prevent leakage if the first bag rips. You should include all of the innards that you are not keeping to cook later, such as the lungs, intestines, and gallbladder. \n If your community has a green bin program, put them in one of the disposable bags and keep it in the freezer until trash collection day, and then put it in the green bin or if not available dispose of the innards in a dumpster or outdoor trash can. The innards will likely start to smell foul, so it is best to take them directly to a dumpster, if possible, or to throw them away in an outdoor trash can that has a lid. \n Note that wild animals, like raccoons or bears, might try to get into the trash if they can smell the innards and other waste. Secure your outdoor trash can, if possible, so that they do not make a mess by spilling it. \n 
 Set the parking gear and the brake. Block the wheels. Raise the front of the LHS with a jack(s) and support the car with jack stands. Remove the splash guards under each fender to reveal access to the mounts. \n Raise the jack only until it just begins raising the engine a very little, to mainly support the engine, but not to raise the vehicle at all., (If your mounts have a heat shield between the mount and engine, remove the nut or bolt from the bracket holding the heatshield, using your ratchet and socket. Remove the heatshield.) Keeping the nuts loosely screwed on to just a few bolt threads, on the bolts, keeps the mounts aligned until both are loosened -- retained to this same degree, held on loosely, on each side of the engine.\n Install the heat shield and its retaining bolts, if your vehicle is so equipped (on the 3.5-liter engine, for example). \n Snug the nuts and bolts on all both mounts, at first only "finger tight". Then snug them all a little., The large nuts and bolts might be torqued to about 45 to 50 foot (13.7 to 15.2 m) pounds. The smaller bolts on the transmission mount are torqued less, perhaps to about 20 to 30 foot (6.1 to 9.1 m) pounds., Raise the front of the vehicle enough to remove your jack stands or blocks and such, and lower your LHS to the ground.
 There are variety of different accordions out there, but some are more well-suited for beginners than others. The more information you gather the better equipped you will be to successfully learn to play the accordion. Here is the most suitable option for beginners: \n Piano Accordions. These are the most popular kinds, with the power of a regular piano in a highly portable size. They have between 25 and 45 piano style treble keys on the right hand. On the left, they are equipped with a bass-chord keyboard. This accordion system is called the stradella, and typically has 120 brass buttons.\n Your accordion is composed of several parts, all crucial to the accordion's sounds: \n Melody Keys. These are buttons on the keyboard part of the instrument. \n Bellows. These are the folds on the instrument that allow it to expand and contract. \n Harmonic, Base, Air Valve. These buttons provide air to escape, adjusting the tone of sound. \n Right Hand Strap. This is the main strap of the instrument that allows you to secure it onto your chest. \n Children and teens or adults will need to start off with different sizes due to the difference in hand and general body size. \n Children should start with the lowest number of bass buttons, 12 bass and 25 treble keys. \n Teens and adults should start with a 48 bass accordion. This amounts to 48 bass and 26 treble keys. \n The 48 bass Piano Accordion is very light weight, and easy to use and handle. Plus, you can play lots of different music on it, which will make you want to hang on to it even if you outgrow it. \n When you begin handling your instrument in the next section of the article, your left arm will move horizontally and vertically, while your right hand will only move vertically. For now, just hold it and see how comfortable or uncomfortable it is. \n Some people prefer to stand while playing and others like to sit with their instrument. All that matters is your sense of comfort and confidence, so try out a few different positions until you feel at ease. \n Your body posture is very important when playing this instrument and slouching will cause you to be inaccurate in your balance and consequently in your performance. \n The accordion is relatively large and requires a little bit of familiarity when holding it. Being able to maintain proper balance is crucial. The more evenly balanced you manage to keep the accordion's weight, the better you'll be able to play because of the added control. And the more control you have, the less uncomfortable the weight will feel. \n Slip your left arm under the strap of the instrument. You'll want to hold it as if you were putting on a backpack on your chest. The piano keys should be to your right and your left hand goes underneath the bass strap - the small strap on the left side of the instrument. \n Note that there is usually a thumb wheel on the left side to adjust the strap. \n Make sure that your accordion fits tightly enough not to move at all while you move. \n An additional strap can be very useful. The back strap keeps the shoulder straps together so that the accordion doesn't move. \n Note that if the back strap is too far down it alleviates weight from the shoulders, making the straps loose on top. This, in turn, causes your straps to move and slide. \n Keep the back strap higher up, or secure it diagonally. \n Remember that when the straps stay in place, so does your instrument. \n The buckles can be found on the top and bottom of the instrument. Take care not to push or pull the accordion yet. \n Don't bend your right wrist while keeping your elbow close to your side. It'll be a bit awkward at the beginning but you'll be able to achieve better accuracy as your hand's circulation won't be impeded. \n This applies the right arm only. \n You right hand should be free and resting above the piano keyboard. \n Press the button down softly, and pull your instrument with your left arm. You'll hear a hissing noise as the air goes into the accordion and the bellows open. \n Note that it's important to use this button when you open and close the bellows while they're moving. \n Don't press down on the keyboard while you're opening and closing the bellows. \n No matter how many bass buttons your accordion has, you'll soon notice that they produce the chords, or vamps, automatically. This is due to the accordion's mechanism. \n The term chord refers to the sound produced by a group of notes played together. \n Keep the bass buttons pressed for only a short time. Imagine they were on fire, and take your finger off quickly. \n This will be quite difficult at first, but do your best not to look at where your fingers go, or need to go. \n If your accordion is a larger model, then look for the note C in the second row. \n For now, your only concern should be getting comfortable with your instrument, and focusing on the first two rows of bass buttons. \n Regardless of how many bass rows your accordion has, you'll only be looking at the first two rows. \n Then, tuck your thumb under your index finger and push on the button right below the note C. This button will be slightly off center, but right below the button that your index finger is pressing. \n Then, press the two buttons alternately to produce a chord. You'll generate a sort of of oom-pah sound. \n Try to pull the bellows smoothly for the best sound effect. \n The beat for the Waltz goes 1, 2, 3--1, 2, 3. Play the C note on the the first beat, and push the button right below the C on the second and third beat. \n This is how you can generate a simply accompaniment, or vamp. \n Now try to pull the bellows in as you alternately press the four buttons you just learned. Repeat this several times to practice. \n Let's try another easy scale exercise that will help you produce your first, controlled sound sequence: \n Expand the instrument's bellows. \n Softly and evenly push it back together, and hold the 1st key down. \n Keep pressing the note key while you change directions by pulling the instrument in opposite directions. \n Go to the next key, push in and pull apart. \n Jump to the next key, and you have now played Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La. \n This exercise has two chords, and you can leave your fingers on the keyboard. Place your thumb on the C, and pinky on the G: begin with the third finger on the E. \n Coordination might seem a little difficult at first, so it's important that you become very familiar with the necessary movements. Repeat the above exercise until you feel confident and can move on to more advanced practices. \n

 You will most likely need it to disassemble and reassemble various parts. Also verify that your model is equipped with a timing chain and not a timing belt. These two parts perform the same task, but replacing them can be quite different. This procedure is only for replacing a timing chain.\n Having your engine clean allows you to better locate any leaks or worn parts. It also makes the job less messy overall. Never clean or work on your engine while it is hot.Keep in mind that the degreaser and oils you are washing off of your engine can kill your grass and pose an environmental threat. This should be done somewhere that is properly set up to drain and filter the chemicals used., This may be stamped directly on the engine (either on the cylinder head, valve covers, or intake manifold) and sometimes listed in the owner’s manual specifications.You can also use a service manual to determine firing order.This will be necessary to know because later you will need to check your number one cylinder (the one that fires first in the firing order). \n You should not work on your engine with the battery plugged in. First remove the ground cable (negative terminal) and then remove the positive terminal. \n This will allow the coolant to be drained from the system. \n The drain cock is located near the bottom of the radiator and is a plastic screw or pull cap that you can release. Engine coolant is a mix of water and antifreeze. It is very toxic and should be stored in a plastic container with a screw-on cap. An old antifreeze bottle is ideal., Trace the radiator hoses from the radiator back to the engine. Squeeze the hose clamps with pliers and slide them back onto the hose. Wiggle the hose to break it free and move it out of the way. \n There is no need to remove the radiator. The hoses need to be loosened and the coolant drained for the purpose of removing the water pump in a later step. \n This can usually be found posted underneath the hood of your car or in your service manual for serpentine belts (S-belts). If you drive a much older car, you may have a multi-belt design (V-belt). Either way, if you cannot find a routing diagram you should take a picture or draw one before removing the belt(s). \n For serpentine belts this is done by compressing the spring loaded tensioner. Some tensioners can be compressed with simple hand tools such as a wrench, and others may require a special tool. V-belts can be removed by adjusting the position of one of their pulleys to release tension. \n Once tension is released, the belt should slide off of the other pulleys easily. \n If your model has heater hoses attached to the water pump, loosen the hose clamps with a screwdriver and slide them back onto the hose.Wiggle the hose and pull it off of the water pump. \n Take out any bolts that hold the water pump to the engine. Usually there are three to five bolts to remove. Once the bolts are removed, you should be able to pull the pump off with your hands., Remove the bolt and washer in the center of the pulley. Put the bolt partially back in the bolt hole and use a harmonic balancer removal tool. The tool should not be a jaw type tool, but instead should apply all of the removal force to the center of the assembly. This protects the rubber ring in the harmonic balancer., Unbolt the timing chain cover from the engine block. Note that the bolts are different lengths so have a system in place to remember which bolt goes where when you put the cover back on. One good method is to put them back into their proper holes in the timing chain cover and set it off to the side. \n These gears are connected by the timing chain so that the position of the piston (connected to the crankshaft) correlates directly to the opening of the fuel and exhaust valves (operated by the camshaft) to keep your engine running smoothly. These gears should each be marked to help you reference their relative position. \n These links are brighter than the other links and are used to align your engine. \n To get your engine to top dead center, line the bright links on the timing chain up with the marks on your camshaft and crankshaft gears.Remember that the crankshaft can be set to top dead center both on the compression and exhaust strokes of the piston.You want top dead center for the compression stroke, so you can insert \n This can be done by loosening the tension gear with a wrench or ratchet. Next slide the chain off of the gears. \n Using a little gear oil now will help to ensure that your chain and gear perform optimally for as long as possible. \n You want the bright links on the new chain to line up exactly with the marks on the gears just like the old chain did. This will allow you to locate top dead center if you ever need to. \n Some chains are tensioned by adjusting either the crankshaft gear or the camshaft gear, while others have an automatic tensioner. This will vary by make and model of your car. The important thing is to make sure that your timing belt is as tight as it should be. \n This is the rubber seal around the crankshaft and the timing cover. \n The seal should be seated into the correct place on the timing cover. It will seal when the cover is bolted onto the engine. \n It is necessary to coat the seal with oil to ensure proper functioning when the seal is compressed., The bolts are varying lengths. Remember the system you set up to keep track of which bolts went where and be sure to use the proper bolt in the proper location. \n There is only the one bolt in the center that fastens the harmonic balancer into place. Check you owner’s manual or service guide for proper torque specifications. \n Replace the bolts that fasten the water pump to the engine block. \n If you removed heater hoses from your water pump, you will need to slide them back onto the water pump. Once the hose is on the pump you can squeeze down the hose clamp with pliers and slide it up over where the hose and pump connect. If the clamp has a tightening screw, tighten it with a screwdriver. This will secure the hose to the pump. \n If the lower radiator hose is still removed or if you removed the upper hose for any reason, put them back on the radiator now. Once the hose has been slid onto the radiator, use a pair of pliers to move the clamps up the hose to the place where the hose and the radiator meet. This will fasten the hose to the radiator. \n If your coolant looks dirty or if it has been more than a year since you last changed the coolant in your vehicle, use new coolant. Dilute the coolant as specified in your owner’s manual or service guide and fill to the mark that says “cool” or “cold” on the tank. If your coolant is clean and relatively new, you can pour the old coolant back into your radiator. \n You should use the routing diagram stamped on your hood or printed in your owner’s manual to make sure that the belt is run properly. Pulleys with grooves are intended to meet the grooved side of the belt, but some flat pulleys are meant to be driven by the flat backside of the belt., This can be done by releasing the tensioner in a serpentine design. If you are working with a V-belt design then you will need to tension the belt manually. A good rule of thumb is that the belt should have a maximum of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of movement in the middle of the belt's longest run.Check your vehicle manual for more information. If in doubt, consult a mechanic. \n You do not want to start your engine without all of the appropriate accessories hooked up. Take a second look over everything and make sure that all is well before moving on. \n Connect the positive cable first, and then connect the ground cable. \n Turn the key and start the engine. \n Look under your hood and under your car to make sure that no fluid is dripping or leaking. If you are leaking coolant, check to make sure all hoses are connected properly to the radiator and water pump. If you are leaking oil you might have to replace the crankshaft seal again. \n This ensures that all cylinders are firing at the correct time and that the valves are opening and closing properly in relation to the piston’s position. \n 
 An electric arc is formed at the tip of the welding rod when a current passes across an air gap and continues through the grounded metal which is being welded. Here are some of the terms and their descriptions used in this article: \n Welding machine. This is the term used to describe the machine which converts 120-240 volt AC electricity to welding voltage, typically 40-70 volts AC, but also a range of DC voltages. It generally consists of a large, heavy transformer, a voltage regulator circuit, an internal cooling fan, and an amperage range selector.The term welder applies to the person doing the welding. A welding machine requires a welder to operate it. \n Leads, or Welding leads. These are the insulated copper conductors which carry the high amperage, low voltage electricity to the work piece that is being welded. \n Rod holder, or stinger is the device on the end of the lead that holds the electrode, which the person welding uses to accomplish the welding task. \n Ground and ground clamp. This is the lead that grounds, or completes the electrical circuit, and specifically, the clamp that is attached to the work to allow the electricity to pass through the metal being welded. \n Amperage, or amps. This is an electrical term, used to describe the electrical current supplied to the electrode. \n DC and reverse polarity. This is a different configuration used in welding with an arc/electrode system, which offers more versatility, especially in overhead welding applications and for use welding certain alloys that do not weld easily with AC voltages. The welding machine that produces this current has a rectifier circuit or has the current supplied by a generator, and is much more expensive than a typical AC welder. \n Electrodes. There are many specialized welding electrodes, used for specific alloys and types of metals, such as cast or malleable iron, stainless or chromoly steel, aluminum, and tempered or high carbon steels. A typical electrode consists of the wire rod in the center covered with a special coating (flux)which burns as the arc is maintained, consuming oxygen and producing carbon dioxide in the weld area to prevent the base metal from oxidizing or burning away in the arc flame during the welding process. Here are some common electrodes and their uses: \n E6011 electrodes are a mild steel electrode with a cellulose fiber coating. The first two numbers in the electrode identification is the tensile strength, measured in pounds per square inch times 1,000. Here, the yield of the electrode would be 60,000 PSI. \n E6010 electrodes are a reverse polarity electrode, commonly used for welding steam and water pipes, and are particularly useful for overhead welding, since the metal holds its position while in a liquid state, being drawn into the molten weld pool by the flow of the direct current from the electrode to the workpiece. \n Other specific purpose E60XX electrodes are available, but since E6011s are considered a standard, general purpose rod, and E6010s are considered the standard for reverse polarity DC welding, they will not be covered in detail in this article. \n E7018 electrodes are low hydrogenflux coated steel rods, with a high yield tensile strength of 70,000 PSI. These are often used in assembling structural steel used in the construction industry, and in other applications where a strong filler material and higher strength weld is required. Note that, although these rods provide greater strength, they are less forgiving in respect to achieving a clean, high-grade weld at incorrect amperages and with dirty (rusted, painted, or galvanized) steels. These electrodes are called low hydrogen due to every attempt to lower the hydrogen content. These electrodes must be stored in an oven with a temperature between 250ºF and 300ºF. This temperature is above the water boiling point of 212ºF at sea level. This temperature keeps the moisture (dew)(H2O) in the air from collecting in the flux. \n Nickel, Castalloy, Ni-Rod electrodes. These are special rods made for welding cast, ductile, or malleable iron, and have more yield, to allow for the expansion and contraction of the iron material being welded. \n Dissimilar metals rods. These rods are made from a special alloy and give better results when welding tempered, hardened or alloyed steels. \n Aluminum rods. These are a more recent technology and allow arc welding aluminum with a conventional welder, rather than using a special gas-shielded wire feed welder like a MIG (metal, inert gas) or TIG (tungsten, inert gas) welding machine, often referred to as heliarc welding, since helium was the gas used to shield the arc flame while welding. The official names created by the American Welding Society (AWS)for this arc type welding are Shielded Metal Arc Welding (stick), Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (tig)and Gas Metal Arc Welding (mig). \n Electrode sizes. Electrodes come in a variety of sizes, measured by the diameter of the metal center of each rod. For mild steel rods, a diameter range of 1⁄16 inch (0.2 cm) to 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) is available, and the size used is determined by the amperage of the welder, and the thickness of the material being welded. Each rod performs best at a given amperage range. Selecting the correct amperage range for a given size rod will depend on the base material and the desired penetration, so specific amperages will only be covered for the welding described further in this article. \n Safety equipment. A critical part of welding safely is having, and knowing how to use, the correct safety equipment for the job. Here are some typical items that are required for welding safely. \n Welding shield (hood). This is the mask which is worn to protect the person welding from the bright flash of the arc, and from sparks being thrown during welding. Standard arc welding lenses are tinted very darkly, since exposure to the arc flash can cause flash burns to the retina of the eye. A level 10 darkness is the minimum for arc welding. Welding hoods with a flip up lens was once preferred, as the dark lens can be lifted up, and a separate clear glass lens will protect the welder from bits of slag while the weld is chipped. The newer self darkening welding shields are the most desirable welding shield now sold. These welding shield lens are very light colored for grinding and torch cutting. When an arc is struck the automatic self darkening lens will change to a preset #10 shade. Even newer on the market are the variable shade automatic self darkening lens. \n Welding gloves. These are special, insulated leather gloves that reach about 6 inches (15.2 cm) above the wrists, and protect the hands and lower arms of the welder (the person welding). They also provide limited protection from accidental shock if the person welding comes into contact with the electrode accidentally. \n Welding leathers. This is an apron like leather jacket that covers the shoulders and chest of the welder, used for overhead work where sparks might ignite the welder's clothing, or cause burns. \n Work boots. The person welding should wear at least a 6 inch (15.2 cm) lace-up type boot to prevent sparks and hot slag from burning his feet. These boots should have insulating soles made from a material which does not melt or burn easily. \n \n Welding is more than dragging a welding rod across a piece of steel and gluing it to another one. The process begins with properly fitting and securing the work pieces, or metal to be welded, together. For thicker pieces, you may want to grind a bevel so subsequent beads can be placed in the groove to fill it completely with a solid weld. Here are the basic steps for completing a simple weld. \n Strike the arc. This is the process of creating an electric arc between the electrode and the workpiece. If the electrode simply allows the current to pass directly into the grounded work piece, there will not be enough heat produced to melt and fuse metal together. \n Move the arc to create a bead. The bead is the metal from the melting electrode flowing together with molten metal from the base metal to fill the space between the pieces being joined by welding. \n Shape the weld bead. This is done by weaving the arc back and forth across the weld path either in a zig zag or figure 8 motion so the metal spreads to the width that you want your finished weld bead to be. \n Chip and brush the weld between passes. Each time you complete a pass, or trip from one end to the other of your weld, you need to remove the slag, or the melted electrode flux material, from the surface of the weld bead so only clean molten metal will be filling the weld on the subsequent pass. \n This means the welding machine, electrodes, cables and clamps, and the metal to be welded. \n For practice, a few pieces of mild steel, at least 3⁄16 inch (0.5 cm) thick will work. \n If the metal consists of two pieces that are to be joined in the welding process, you may need to prep, or weld prep them, by grinding a beveled edge on the sides that are to be joined. This allows for sufficient penetration of the weld arc to melt both sides to a molten state so the filler metal bonds through the sectional thickness of the metal. At the least, you should remove any paint, grease, rust, or other contaminants so you are working with a clean pool of molten metal as you weld. \n Locking type pliers, "C" clamps, a vice, or spring loader clamps will usually work. For special projects, you may find you will have to adapt different techniques to secure the work pieces until they are joined. \n Make sure there is a clean location so that the electrical circuit can be completed with minimal resistance at the ground location. Again, rust or paint will interfere with the grounding of your work piece, making it difficult to create an arc when you begin welding. \n As an example, 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) plate steel can be welded effectively using an E6011, 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) electrode, at between 80-100 amps. Place the electrode in the electrode holder (henceforth referred to as the stinger) making sure the conductive material of the stinger clamp is on the clean metal at the end of the electrode. \n You should hear a humming sound from the transformer. The sound of the cooling fan running may or may not be heard. Some welding machine fans only operate when the machine requires cooling. If you do not, you may need to check the circuit that is supplying your power, and the breakers in the panel box. Welding machines require a considerable amount of power to operate, often a special circuit rated at 60 amps or more at 240 volts. \n Hold your welding shield up just high enough so you can see to move the electrode to within a few inches of the workpiece, ready to flip in down to protect your eyes. You may want to practice tapping the electrode against the weld metal to get the feel of it before turning the power on, but never strike an electric arc without protecting your eyes. \n Position the tip of the rod close to it, then drop the welding hood into place. You want to tap the tip of the electrode against the metal to complete the electrical circuit, then instantaneously pull it back a little bit, to create an electric arc between the electrode tip and the metal being welded. Another way to strike an arc is like striking a match. This arc gap, or airspace, creates a great deal of resistance in the electrical circuit, which is what produces the arc flame or plasma and heat needed to liquefy the electrode and the metal adjacent to the weld area. \n This takes a great deal of practice, since different electrode diameters and welding amperages require a different gap between the tip of the electrode and the work piece, but if you can hold the gap steady, a continuous electric arc will occur from the electrode to the work piece. Typically, the arc gap should be no greater than the electrode diameter. Practice steadying the arc by holding the electrode about 1/8 to 3/16 of an inch from the work piece, then begin moving along the path you want to weld. As you move the electrode, the metal will be melting away, filling the pool of molten metal and building your weld. \n When you have mastered controlling the arc, you will begin to practice laying, or building up the weld bead. This is the deposit of metal that joins the two pieces that you are welding together. The technique you use for laying your bead will depend on the width of the gap (if there is one) you are filling, and the depth you want the weld bead to penetrate. The slower you move the electrode, the deeper the weld will go into the metal work pieces, and for making a wide path, the more you zig zag or weave the electrode's tip, the wider the bead you will lay up. \n If the electrode grounds to the metal and becomes stuck, jerk the stinger to break the rod free either from the stinger clamp or the weld metal. If the arc is lost because you move the electrode too far from the metal's surface, stop the process and clean the slag from the spot you are welding so when you re-strike the arc to continue, there will be no slag in the weld area to contaminate the new weld you are beginning from the place the arc was lost or broken. Never lay a new bead over existing slag, as this material will melt in the arc plasma and bubble through the new layer of metal you are placing, resulting in a weak and dirty weld. \n This will allow you to fill more of the weld in a single pass, leaving a cleaner and more sound weld. The electrode is moved in a sideways motion as it is drawn along the weld path, either in a zig-zag, curved, or figure eight motion. \n If you find the finished weld bead is pitted, with deep cratering at the bead's edges, or the adjacent metal is simply melted or burned away, reduce the amperage incrementally until the condition is corrected. If, on the other hand, you have difficulty striking or maintaining an arc, you may need to increase the amperage. \n After you have finished welding, you may want to remove the slag and clean up your weld, either to allow paint to bond better, or simply for cosmetic reasons. Chip off the slag and wire brush the weld to remove any foreign material and remaining slag. If the surface needs to be flat to allow fitting the piece you have welded to another piece, use an angle grinder to remove the top, or high portion of the bead. A clean weld, particularly after grinding flat, is easier to examine to see if pitting, puddling, or other defects have occurred while welding. \n Freshly welded metal will corrode rather quickly if exposed to the elements, since the actual base metal is exposed directly to moisture. \n 
 Tell the store employee what kind of switch you want and how many you’ll need, and they can help you determine the best purchase. \n Single-pole switches are the simplest and most common. A single-pole switch has just two positions—“on” and “off.”\n It’s a steel box that may be located inside the house, in the basement, in the garage, or along one of the outside walls. You can either turn off the breaker that controls the lights in the specific room you are working on or turn off all the power to the house by switching off the main breaker. \n Flip the light switch on and off several times to be sure the power is off. \n Using a flat-head screwdriver, turn the screws holding the plate in place counter-clockwise to loosen them. \n Once the switch plate cover has been removed, use a flat-head screwdriver to remove the screws mounting the switch to the wall. Turn the screws counter-clockwise until they are freed from the wall. \n Pull the switch away from the wall to expose the wiring, but leave the wires connected. Use a circuit or voltage tester to ensure no current is flowing. \n If using a circuit tester, hold one probe of the circuit tester against the grounding wire (green or bare copper), and touch the other probe to each of the screw terminals (located along the sides of the switch). \n If using a voltage tester, simply hold the tester near the wires. \n If the tester registers any current, stop the project immediately until you’re able to power off the circuit. \n Pull the switch as far from the electrical box as the wires allow. \n Take careful note of how the switch is wired. The wires will be connected to the switch by either screw terminals or push-in connectors. \n Take a picture or draw a diagram so you can wire the new switch in the same way. \n Use a marker or colored tape to uniquely label each wire so you can tell them apart. \n The box will contain one or two cables (or sets of wires). If the box contains two cables, it means the switch is in the middle of the circuit. You’ll see a total of six wires: two black (hot) wires, two green or bare copper (grounding) wires, and two (neutral) wires, which may be black, white, red, or any other color than green. \n Mark the wire connected to the brass screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the brass terminal as the “hot” wire. \n Mark the wire connected to the silver screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the silver terminal as the “neutral” wire. \n Finally, mark the green or copper wire connected to the green screw terminal (on the other side of the switch from the brass and silver terminals) as the “grounding” wire. \n If the box contains only a single cable (or single set of three wires), it means the switch is at the end of the circuit. You will see a black (hot) wire, a green or bare copper (grounding) wire, and a third (neutral) wire, which may be black, white, red, or any color other than green. \n Mark the wire connected to the brass screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the brass terminal as the “hot” wire. \n Mark the wire connected to the silver screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the silver terminal as the “neutral” wire. \n Finally, mark the green or copper wire connected to the green screw terminal (on the other side of the switch from the brass and silver terminals) as the “grounding” wire. \n The switch may have either screw terminal connectors, which will be located along the side of the switch, or push-in connector holes, which will be located at the back of the switch. \n If the switch has both screw terminals and push-in holes, most electricians recommend using the screw terminals for a more secure connection. But do not over-tighten; you may break the internal parts of the switch. If you tighten the terminals and hear a crack, discard the switch and use another. \n If the wires are connected to screw terminals, turn each screw counter-clockwise with a screwdriver to loosen and slide the wire out with a pair of needle-nose pliers. \n If the wires are connected to push-in connectors, the holes that the wires are pushed into will typically have a small slot beneath the hole. Insert a small screwdriver into the slot and push forward to release the wire. \n Attach the black wire (hot) to the brass screw terminal. Either: \n Use needle-nose pliers to wrap a little more than half of the bare wire clockwise around the screw and then tighten the screw clockwise to secure the wire. \n Or push the wire into the push-in hole on the same side of the switch as the brass screw. \n Either: \n Use needle-nose pliers to wrap a little more than half of the bare wire clockwise around the screw. Tighten the screw clockwise to secure the wire. \n Or push the wire into the hole on the same side of the switch as the silver screw. \n Use needle-nose pliers to wrap a little more than half of the bare wire clockwise around the screw. Tighten the screw clockwise to secure the wire. \n You should see the word “top” written on the switch indicating the side of the switch that should be vertically oriented toward the top. \n Do not over tighten the switch plate, since it may crack under too much pressure. \n Go back to the new switch and flip it on and off several times to ensure it’s in working order. \n

 While height is just one of the factors that dictates the safety of a fall (along with falling surface and jump form) it is something you should take into consideration while you plan your jump. 10 feet can result in an injury if you fall on one foot or your spine. Falls of 30 feet or more could result in serious injuries or even death.There have been a few recorded cases of people falling thousands of feet and surviving. Don't use this as an example to go by, however. These are considered miraculous exceptions for a good reason.\n Softer surfaces are always preferable to hard ones, as they'll help absorb some of the shock of the land. \n Grass, sand and mud are good places to fall to. Concrete, on the other hand, is about as unforgiving as it gets. \n Surfaces with a lot of degree can pose an extra threat. Landing onto an otherwise soft area with pine needles would result in a different (but similarly intense) sort of pain. \n If you have time to prepare for your jump, you should make sure to wear something on your feet that will help to cushion the force. If you're aiming for a proper landing on your feet, you run the risk of hurting them without something to ease the shock. Most sports sneakers include this technology in some form. \n Shoes with a strong grip help if there's any risk of slipping during your fall. \n If you get needlessly frustrated, your joints will tense up. This increases the risk of potential injury. If you've got the time to spare, try looking at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself everything will be okay. \n If this is the case, you'll want to be as practical as possible. Look around you, and try to see if there are any opportunities to get yourself lower to the ground. \n Holding yourself off a ledge can get you 6 feet closer to the ground. This difference in altitude can mean a lot with regards to potential injury., It goes without saying that having a friend watching over you is more helpful if he's already got some fitness knowledge. Perhaps more importantly, the presence of someone nearby will ensure the quickest call for medical attention if you need it for whatever reason. \n Even if it's not enough time to train, the act of going through a bit of a moderate workout will loosen up your joints and get your body into the proper momentum for strain. \n As you're about to jump, make a point of spotting the place you would like to land. Having a specific place on the ground below you will increase your stability. If you're only aiming for a broad area, you're more likely to lose concentration. \n Although you should have already warmed up by this point, you can go through a mock jump right before you make the actual leap. Many athletic jumpers use a mock run-through in the seconds before as a way to build up momentum. You should do the same as you count down to your leap. Use these final moments as an opportunity to check everything you're doing with your jump set-up. \n In a jump down to a lower place, you won't want to jump much higher than you already are. Get just enough force to earn you the proper stance and momentum. Keep your elbows close to your body, and tuck your chin in close to your neck.Bend your knees and lunge forward however much you need to. All of this will minimize potential injury. \n For the sake of keeping your body straight, keep your eyes fixed forward. This will keep your body from going imbalanced in mid-jump. \n Some people may freak out if they see themselves dropping a far-enough distance, so if you're queasy, it's best to keep your eyes off the ground. \n A proper athletic jump should end in the same stance as it began. Do your best to keep your body straight. Even in freefall, it's important to keep your stance straight and stable. Letting your limbs go wild will increase the risk of injury. \n Keep your feet and knees together while you jump. This will maximize the chances of you landing on both feet.Although you'll want to keep your body from moving around excessively, you should allow room for flexibility as your body meets the landing., Giving your body the freedom to adjust as you meet the ground is essential for preventing injury.Don't lock your knees at any point, and give your muscles the limberness they'll need to counter the force of the land. \n Bending the knees will reduce shock. Just make sure your legs aren't bent more than 90 degrees.Exercising with squats will help your body adjust to this change when it's needed., If your body is "soft" (rather than tensed), you'll be able to react naturally to a landing. This is a natural way of minimizing potential damage in a fall.With this said, it's a good idea to try to make yourself as relaxed as possible before you set into your jump. \n Try to strike a balance between going limp and holding your proper form. \n Do your best to keep your legs and feet together throughout the jump. This will maximize the chances of your feet hitting the ground at the same time. Landing on both feet is more important if your jump is high enough. An imbalanced fall can result in severe injury. \n Don't try to break your fall with your hands. Hands can alleviate some of the shock on your feet, but they can generally withstand only a fraction of the pressure that feet can.When you land, try to land on the balls of your feet, shoulder-width apart. \n It's not just a thing for action movies. A landing roll is arguably the best way of absorbing shock from a fall. If you're landing from a height, you should aim for a diagonal roll. Pushing yourself into a roll with one foot will avoid placing stress on your spine.As you fall, aim a shoulder to the ground in the direction you want to roll in. As you're rolling, take a foot and hit the ground with it to give you the extra force you need to complete the roll. \n Rolls are difficult to master and should be left to trained athletes. It should be said as a high-difficulty alternative to landing on both feet. \n Try rolling on both sides. It's a good habit for athletic versatility, and you may find you prefer one side over the other.For practice, regular "gymnastics rolls" (without a jump) will get you used to the experience of rolling. They're relatively easy to do provided you have a degree of fitness and flexibility. If you want to practice with diagonal rolls, a playground (with a soft ground) is a good place to start.Rolls lead well into continued movement. This is why they're so highly recommended in sports like parkour. \n They're relatively cheap and easy to do anywhere, but they target a lot of muscles that aren't typically worked out. To squat, bend your knees as low as you can while you keep your back perfectly straight. Hold your place for 30 seconds, then release and try again. \n Squats are remarkably challenging at first if you're unused to them. However, your body will train up fast. \n Plyometrics refer to a series of exercises intended to balance out the use of muscles in your legs. Because people are usually sitting down in their jobs, the sedentary behaviour trains the legs to depend on knees instead of glutes. Plyometrics aims to reverse this.Make a sequence of tiny jumps, only a couple inches off the ground. Try to make your landings as quiet and soft a possible.Shift your body's weight around on your heels, keeping your knees behind your toes throughout the movement. \n This is short of the recommended 7-9 hour routine. Athletes should arguably be sleeping 9-10 hours in order to accommodate for all of the wear and tear the body goes through from regular practice. If you're not giving yourself enough sleep, you're putting a major curb on your jump potential. \n In the case of jumping, water is essential to keep the joints fluid and limber. Keep a refillable bottle of water whenever you're planning to train or jump. Drink it whenever you get a break. \n Don't drink so much water that you end up feeling bloated. The feeling doesn't last forever, but it is uncomfortable and limits your training for a while. \n Start with small heights, and gradually work your way forward. The process may not be as glamorous as with taking the biggest jumps from the start, but it is more effective in terms of raw learning. \n Even if you consider yourself properly trained at a certain point, there's a lot of value in continuing to practice. Because something like jumping depends on a lot of various factors like distance, height and weight, the particulars will be different each time you try it. Over time, you'll get a sharper understanding of how your body is best used with a jump. \n 
 A first-degree burn is usually a thermal burn caused by contact with a hot object or environment. It may result from sun exposure (sunburn), oil splatter from a hot pan, or accidentally touching a hot oven rack. A first-degree burn is painful, and will leave a deep red color on the top layer of skin (epidermis). But despite the stinging redness, there is no blistering in a first-degree burn. The skin will remain dry and intact.First-degree burns are quite common, and very rarely require professional medical treatment. \n Healing occurs in three to five days.\n But the skin damage will go beyond the top layer (epidermis) down into the top of the second layer (dermis). And unlike a first-degree burn, you will see blistering in a second-degree burn. Pain and bleeding are both good signs, as they suggest that there is no significant damage to nerves or blood vessels. \n Superficial second-degree burns usually heal without scarring within two weeks, and do not require medical attention., A superficial second-degree burn can heal on its own, but a deep second-degree burn needs to be seen by a doctor. Look for spots of pale skin interspersed between the blisters. The blisters will bleed easily and may ooze a straw-colored material. If left untreated, deep second-degree burns can become third degree burns within a few days.Always seek treatment for a second degree burn if: \n You are not sure what level of burn you have \n Have diabetes or a compromised immune system \n Were injured by a chemical burn, especially alkaline burns like from Drano. \n A first degree burn can always heal on its own at home, but large second-degree burns should be seen by a doctor. Whether superficial or deep, a second-degree burn that affects more than 10-15% of your skin needs medical attention. The doctor will both assess the burn and treat possible dehydration. You lose a lot of fluid through your damaged skin when you have large burns. Tell the doctor if you feel thirsty, weak, dizzy, or are having trouble urinating. If he suspects dehydration, your doctor may give you IV fluids., Untreated third degree burns can become septic and cause death. They are distinguished from a second-degree burn by the presence of nerve, vein, and muscle damage. \n Because of the nerve damage, the burn site will feel numb rather than painful, though the edges may still hurt. \n Skin will both look and feel dry and thick/leathery. You will likely experience swelling. \n Rather than redness, you may see white, yellow, brown, purple, or even black skin. \n You may feel thirsty, dizzy, or weak. Dehydration may cause trouble urinating. \n However, you should consider seeing a doctor if the burn doesn’t heal within several weeks, or if new, unexplained symptoms emerge. Any increase in pain, swelling, redness, or discharge that becomes unmanageable should be examined as well. Seek immediate emergency attention if you experience the following: \n Burns to the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, or major joints \n Chemical or electrical burns \n Third-degree burns \n Trouble breathing or burns to the airway \n Ocular chemical burns can be very serious, so you need to take immediate action. If a chemical gets into your eyes, flush your eyes with water for at least five full minutes. You should always see a doctor for examination after a potential chemical burn to the eyes. He may add a 1% calcium gluconate solution to your eye-flushing routine. The doctor can also prescribe anesthetic eye drops to control your pain. \n If you wear contacts, remove them carefully when flushing out your eyes. \n Chemicals powerful enough to burn the skin can continue to work their way into deeper layers if left untreated. Thus, all chemical burns require medical attention. However, while waiting to see the doctor, the best thing you can do is hold the burn under cool (not cold) running water or soak it in a water bath. \n The first order of business in a first or superficial second-degree thermal burn is to lower the skin temperature at the burn site. Place the burned skin in cool (not cold) water for 10 minutes. If you don't want to waste running water, fill a sink or bathtub to submerge the skin. Either refill with cold water as the water warms up, or use ice cubes to keep the water temperature low. \n Just make sure that all the burned skin is either submerged in or under the flow of running cold water. \n Note that many experts advise against applying ice to a burn, as the dramatic temperature change can cause frostbite.Always cool the skin in water for at least 20 minutes if you want to apply ice to it. Simply seal the ice into a Ziploc bag with some water and wrap a rag or paper towel around it to create a barrier between you skin and the extreme cold. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables out of your freezer if you don't have ice. Apply the ice for about ten minutes, rotating it around the burn site if it gets too cold. \n Always make sure to use a cloth or paper towel barrier. \n Ointments seal the burn, and may actually prevent healing if you apply them too soon. For first-degree burns, wait 24 hours before you apply any burn care or other ointments.If you are not near a medical facility and you have a second-degree burn, apply bacitracin ointment (an antibiotic) to the burn to prevent infection as you get to treatment. This is the only situation in which you should apply bacitracin to burned skin. \n The pharmacy may have any of a variety of benzocaine brands such as Anacaine, Chiggerex, Mandelay, Medicone, Outgro, or Solarcaine. Furthermore, these products are available in a wide variety of applications: cream, spray, liquid, gel, ointment, or wax. Read the instructions on the package to learn the correct application method and dosage. \n Make sure not to overuse benzocaine, as it soaks into the skin more easily than some other local anesthetics. \n You can relieve some of the pain from a minor burn by taking an over-the-counter pain reliever. An oral NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) such as ibuprofen or naproxen will help relieve pain and inflammation from the burn.Follow all dosing instructions on the packaging. Take the smallest dose that is effective at relieving your pain. \n If cold water doesn't make the pain diminish, shaving cream is a surprisingly effective solution! Shaving creams like Barbasol contain a chemical called triethanolamine. Triethanolamine is an active ingredient in Biatine, a prescription cream used to treat even severe burns in hospital settings.Just spread it over the affected skin and leave it alone until the pain goes down. \n Avoid mentholated shaving creams, as they may cause further irritation.This should only be considered when you have a first-degree burn. Do not attempt this method with a burn that is any more severe than a sunburn. \n While you may prefer the idea of home or natural remedies, many of these methods are untested, relying on anecdotal and not scientific evidence. Without medical backing, these methods can be risky and are likely not recommended by your doctor. If you wish to use a natural remedy, talk to your doctor first. \n If you choose to utilize these methods, you must still cool and clean the burn first. You should also seek immediate medical attention for anything more severe than a first-degree or superficial second-degree burn. \n The chemicals in the aloe plant's leaves do more than just minimize pain and inflammation. They actually encourage faster healing and the growth of fresh, healthy skin. Treat the burn with aloe lotion several times a day, as necessary. \n Never apply aloe products to an open wound. \n You can use pure aloe from an aloe plant. Alternatively, look for 100% pure aloe vera gel at the store. \n However, lotions with St. John's wort may be a little harder to find than aloe lotions. You can find them easily online, though, or in many health food stores. \n Do not apply St. John's wort essential oil to burns, though, as it can prevent the skin from cooling. \n If you have a large burn area — from sunburn, for example — you might add a few drops of the oil to your bath and soak in it. Smaller areas may benefit from more focused treatment. \n Make sure to cool the burned skin with cold water for at least ten minutes. \n Soak a clean gauze or rag in ice-cold water. \n To this gauze/rag, add one drop of essential oil for every square inch of burned skin. \n Apply the rag to the burned area. \n Honey has antibacterial properties that promote faster healing in a wide variety of injuries.Instead of running for your pantry, though, look for medicinal grade honey for best results. It's not usually available in regular grocery stores, so look for health food stores or providers of ayurvedic medicine. You can also find medicinal grade honey easily online. \n Do not apply honey to broken skin, or burns that are worse than first-degree burns. \n The only exception is if you are far away from a medical care facility. If you cannot get to treatment quickly, use an antibiotic ointment or honey on the burn to help prevent infection as you wait to get treatment., Simply steep one teaspoon of calendula flowers in a cup of boiling water for 15 minutes. Once it's been strained and cooled, you can either soak the burned area in it or apply a cloth soaked in the tea to the skin. If you have calendula oil instead of leaves, dilute 1/2 to one teaspoon in 1/4 cup of water. You may be able to find calendula creams in naturopathic stores or practices. Apply calendula four times daily until the burn has healed. \n Studies also suggest that green tea can be helpful for treating burns., Though the smell is unpleasant and it might make your eyes water, onions have been shown to sooth burns.Simply cut up some onion and gently rub it against the burn, working the juice into the wound without causing pain. Do this several times a day until the wound heals, making sure to use fresh onions every time. \n When you're not using these treatments, you must protect the damaged skin from infection. Pat the burned area dry, then cover it with clean gauze. Tape or wrap it into place, then change the dressing daily until the skin appears normal. Check for signs of infection every day: fever, increased redness, and pus.If you see such symptoms, notify your doctor immediately. \n 
 This will save you hours in time spent ruffling the pettiskirt by hand.\n The nylon chiffon fabric should be approximately 108 inches (2.7m) wide. \n You may choose a similar shade to the nylon chiffon, or a different color. \n This can take longer than cutting other fabrics because it can slip easily. You will need several different strip widths. \n Cut 3 strips that are 6 inches (15.2cm) wide and 108 inches (2.7m) long. \n Cut 6 strips that are 4 inches (10.2cm) wide and 108 inches (2.7m) long. \n Cut 24 strips of 2-inch (5cm) wide fabric that are 108 inches (2.7m) long. Smaller lengths can be connected to make 108 inches (2.7m) long, if need be. \n It should be 7.5 inches (19cm) wide and 48 inches (1.2m) long to go around a girl's waist band. The elastic can later be cinched in to create a bigger or smaller waist. \n Your ribbon should be 1 inch (2.5cm) in width. \n Cut an elastic that is approximately that long, taking off extra for a tighter waist band, or adding extra for extra room. \n In order to connect the first strips, you will want it to be set to a 4:1 gathering ration. \n This means that you are going to gather more on your 2-inch (5cm) strips than you will with your 4-inch (10.2cm) and 6 inch (15.2cm) strips. The many ruffles will create a pettiskirt full of body. \n You will be making 3 layers of nylon chiffon ruffles to comprise the body of the skirt. Make each of the layers 1 at a time. \n Feed them into your ruffler foot. Feed them through your sewing machine until you have run the entire length of the 4-inch (10.2cm) strip. \n You will need 4 times the amount of 2-inch (5cm) strips than 4-inch (10.2cm) strips to account for the ruffling ratio. You will need 4 2-inch (5cm) strips for each 4-inch (10.2cm) strip you gather. Either pin the new 2-inch (5cm) strip to the end of the last strip in advance, or simply feed in the next 2-inch (5cm) strip by hand when the last is finished. \n It should be a 2 to 1 ratio. \n You will need 2 of the ruffles you made to sew to the length of the 6-inch (15.2cm) strip. \n You may want to pin the 2 4-inch (10.2cm) strips end to end on the 6-inch (15.2cm) strip before you start sewing. \n Set it aside. \n It should now be 7.5 inches (19cm) by 24 inches (70cm). Make sure the right sides face each other. \n Make sure to back stitch to secure it. \n Stitch an additional time 1 inch (2.5cm) below the seam. This is where your elastic will be inserted. \n Match the right side of the waist band to the right side of the top layer of chiffon. \n This is on the opposite side of where the elastic will go. \n Turn it inside out when you are finished. \n You can also attach a button on 1 end and a button loop at the other end of the elastic, if you prefer. \n Tie a bow and place it in front or back, depending on your child's preference. \n 
 You'll need a putty knife with a stiff, 1/16 inch blade with a single 45 degree bevel on one side of the working edge. These are commonly available at hardware stores. A wide screwdriver also works if it is ground in the same way. But note: make sure the working edge is not sharp enough to cut anything. It can be rounded slightly with sandpaper. \n Note that directions in these instructions, like "top" and "bottom," are relative to when the pump is installed in the sink. That is "top" and "up" are above the sink and "bottom" and "down" are below the sink.\n  Remove the spout by gently pulling it up off the pump body.  Pull the supply tube from the other end of the pump body.  Continue rinsing the now exposed parts.  Blot the pump body dry.,  Looking very closely, find the joint between the pump body and the pump top.  It is on the shoulder, the widest part of the pump body.  The top of the shoulder is part of the pump top and the bottom of the shoulder is part of the pump body.  Gently place the beveled edge of the putty knife on the joint and press gently to force the top up and out of the bottom.,  Be prepared to catch it by cupping the pump body in your hand while pulling up on the pump top gripped between your thumb and forefinger.  It helps to have a paper towel on your work surface right under your hands. At this point the pump parts will all come apart and soap will get all over your hands.  Carefully rinse each part and lay them out.  Don't lose any parts!  None of them are optional.,  Inspect that the parts are smooth and that the O-ring is not cut or nicked.  If any part is rough, cut, nicked or otherwise damaged the entire pump must be replaced. \n Supply tube (or intake tube, slanted end goes down) \n Pump body (cylinder, square end of supply tube inserts in the bottom) \n Foot valve (looks like the head valve, pointed lips point up) \n Foot valve holder (also holds the large end of the coil spring) \n Coil spring (small end goes up) \n Head valve holder (also holds the small end of the coil spring) \n Head valve (pointed lips point up) \n Piston (includes the outlet tube on its top and the o-ring near its bottom) \n Pump cap (holds the spring and piston in the pump cylinder). \n Spout (connects to the outlet tube on top of the piston) \n  This is a little tricky, as the assembly cannot be just dropped into the cylinder. \n Hold the coil spring with the large end up. \n Place the upside down assembled foot valve holder and foot valve over the large end of the spring. \n Continue holding this vertically while placing the upside-down cylinder over the assembly until the valve is against the bottom of the cylinder. \n Turn the assembly over, keeping the valve against the bottom of the cylinder. \n Keep the cylinder pointing up. \n  The o-ring end should be pointed at by the notched end of the pump body top., Press the cap and cylinder together until the two shoulders meet.  The last 1/8 inch or so snaps together with just a small amount of extra pressure.,  It will take about 5 to 10 pumps before soap will come out of the spout.  The pump should work smoothly and not stick.
\n If you're lucky you'll be able to find some brackets, corner supports, or angle-iron scrap that can simply be trimmed and set up. If not, however, you'll have to cut the blades from 18-gauge sheet metal, bend them, and drill two 1/4" holes in each section. Then dig identical holes in the tub and hold the agitators in position, using 1/4" bolts. Once that's done, you can also liberally apply bondo to the bottom and sides of the vessel's interior to seal its holes. \n Mount the smaller rollers—by pushing a nail into the disks and tee fitting and fastening it with a nut—and attach the main wheels as well. \n Mark and then drill the cotter pin holes as close as possible to the disks, to prevent the shaft from having excessive end play and wobble, then grease the axle and secure the whole assembly with two cotter pins.) \n (Hint: Rotate the drum in the correct direction. the angled paddle blades should bite into the gritty substance and then drop it from the top of the vat.) Of course, if you wish, you can attach handles to the outside of the drum—opposite each paddle—by using longer 1/4" bolts to secure the "mixers." (Be certain that your grips clear all parts of the frame during rotation.) \n And—if you hose the drum out thoroughly after each job—you'll have a trouble-free tool for years to come! \n 
, There are two ways to do it so I’ll show the first and then I’ll show the one that I think is easier. Once you deal with these you will be able to easily take a date and mentally crunch the day of the week rapidly in your head just like Rainman. \n For example: \n 2000 = 0 \n 2001 = 1 \n 2002 = 2 \n 2003 = 3 \n 2004 = 4 \n 2005 = 5 \n 2006 = 0 \n Etc. \n Of course this is problematic because a “Leap Year” occurs every four years so that has to be factored in or not. Leap Years occur every four years, 2008 was a leap year so: \n 2007 = 1 \n 2008 = 3 \n 2009 = 4 \n 2010 = 5 \n 2011 = 6 \n 2012 = 1 \n 2013 = 2 \n Notice the zero got moved around. \n The good news is there’s a shortcut, we’ll take the shortcut. Just take the last two digits of any year and divide it by four and ignore the remainder. (Anytime you don't have a remainder it's a Leap Year and then January Code is 5 and February Code is 1 as shown above) For Example: \n The year 2061 is handled as, (61 / 4) = 15 with a remainder of one (Discard the one)\n Then add that answer to the last two digits of the year (61 + 15) = 76 \n Divide 10 by 4 and we get 2 with a discarded remainder of 2. So we add 10 + 2 for an answer of 12 and see that a multiple of 7 will give us a 5 left over so the year code for 2010 is “5”. \n That’s; (5 + 25 + 4) = 34. Then multiples of seven will get us to (7 * 4) = 28. The (34 – 28) = 6. The number six is the code for Saturday. So Christmas day 2010 will fall on a Saturday. \n \n Month Code; Divide the last two digits of a year by four, discard the remainder and add the whole number to the last two digits of the year. Then use the multiples of 7 to get as close as you can to that answer and subtract the two for the year code. \n
 Administering a coffee enema can have adverse health risks, including colitis,septicemia, and rectal burns due to the temperature of the coffee. There have even been reports of coffee-enema-related deaths., Despite holistic rumors a coffee enema is unlikely to have significant effects. The caffeine absorption from a coffee enema is far less than drinking coffee, and it has a negligible effect on blood pressure and heart rate.While limited use may not be harmful to every user, the benefits appear to be minimal. \n If you are considering a coffee enema, talk to your doctor about it first. It is likely that your physician will advise against the treatment, but she may be able to offer alternatives or to give you additional information about your prognosis. Other health and lifestyle changes may have a greater effect on your wellbeing with fewer risks. \n Since the theory behind the coffee enema has to do with the body’s response to caffeine, you should try drinking coffee instead of using an enema. You will absorb more caffeine by drinking the coffee without the other health risks of the enema., If you choose do do a coffee enema despite the fact that there are few likely health benefits and many possible risks, then do what you can to minimize the risks: \n Cool the temperature to an appropriate temperature to avoid burns. \n Keep equipment as sterile as possible. \n Watch for signs of infection and seek medical attention immediately if you experience a fever after administering a coffee enema. \n Do not discontinue other types of medical treatment in favor of this unproven alternative therapy. \n Do not share the enema equipment with anyone. \n Always wear vinyl or latex gloves when administering enemas. \n Boil less than 1 quart because you will add ice cubes later. \n Use unchlorinated water to make the coffee because chlorine could kill the bacteria and germs your system needs to remain healthy. \n (24 grams) of ground, caffeinated coffee and boil for 5 minutes. \n This will settle the coffee grounds to the bottom of the pan and cool the liquid. \n Strain the coffee into a container you will use only for enemas, as feces could get into the syringe when you refill the bulb for your second enema. \n The bulb will suck in the coffee and should hold about 1 cup (236 ml) of coffee. \n If you encounter any resistance, stop. Piercing a colon is no fun if you do pierce your colon seek medical attention immediately by calling your local Emergency Medical service immediately. In the USA, that number is 911. \n Do not strain to hold the coffee. If you feel it necessary to move your bowels before 12 minutes pass do so. \n Rinse thoroughly with warm, clean water. \n Loosen the clamp a bit; some coffee will run out. When the air is removed from the tubing, clamp the tubing closed again. \n If you feel fullness or discomfort, clamp the tubing closed immediately. Remove the nozzle when you finish releasing the coffee into yourself. \n Ensure you remove the protective cover from the nozzle before you attempt to insert the nozzle. \n
 Many rope bags include a hole in the bottom: tie one end of the rope so that it will not pull through the hole. To pack up your rope, simply stuff the rope into the bag. Be sure to keep one end free so that you can easily find it when you're climbing; consider tying it to an outside strap of the sack. \n That is, run it through your hands and stack it in an orderly pile so it's less likely to get tangled during the coiling process. Leave the bottom end of the rope sticking out from the bottom of the rope pile. \n Once your arms are spread, grasp both strands of rope in your left hand, too. \n Hold one end of the rope in your dominant hand. Take your other hand, and run it along the length from your dominant hand, over your shoulder and behind your neck, and down your straight non-dominant arm. The rope should hang on your neck like a dirty, heavy scarf. \n Hold onto both strands of rope with your left hand as you reach across with your right hand, grasping both strands between your left hand and the stack of rope coils. Then, take the hand opposite from the slack and grab the slack, then do the same flip over your head and onto your shoulders. Continue this way until you have the entire rope going back and forth across your shoulders and arms and looping through your hands each time. \n Be sure to leave at least two feet of slack. If you want to carry the coil as a "rope pack", leave five to ten feet of slack \n Drape this length of rope across your shoulders, behind your neck. \n Make sure you continue working with both strands at once. \n When you are almost done, and you've left 6-10 feet of slack rope, grab the entire bundle behind your neck; pull it up and over so that you have all your rope in front of you. \n Pull the coils off your shoulders, holding them together so you don't drop any strands of rope. \n Bring your hands together, take the two bundles of rope, and put them together in one big loop. \n You should be holding a loose coil in one hand: an upside down U shape of all your rope with loops on the ends of the U. Hold that loop in one hand (probably your dominant one) while you bring the whole bundle back over your head. \n Hold the bundle here, so each end of the coils drapes down on either side. \n Wrap both ends of the rope around the bundle you made, below where your hand grips the coils, cinching each wrap tight. You should be able to just hold the whole bundle by the slack now. \n The bottom of the coil may look a bit untidy but that doesn't matter as long as the top is tight and orderly. \n Leave yourself approximately three feet of rope, and let whichever hand is holding the U-shape grab the remaining end. Let go of the bundle, and pull the end through at the same time, without letting go with the other hand. Bring the end of the rope through its own loop at the top of the bundle, creating a half hitch around the top of the bundle. Reach through the hole you left, between the "top" of the folded coil bundle and the wraps you just made. Grasp the trailing sections of rope near the bundle and pull them both partway through the hole, creating a loop. \n Feed the slack around the big loop a few times, bundling it all together so it looks like a really thick noose. Wrap it at least five times, but probably no more than ten. It is up to you how much you want to wrap, and if you need more room, unwind the end in the loop to give you more room. \n Take a loop of the slack and put it through the noose's loop; feed the rest of the slack through its own loop, crochet-stitch style. \n Slide the loop over the top of the coiled climbing rope, so this loop lies over the other wraps you just made. Then pull on the loose ends of the rope to cinch it down, effectively tying the bundle shut. \n The rope should be ready to carry. Slide it into your backpack or a stuff sack, or hanging it from your harness. Make sure that the rope is secure. \n If you leave a longer tail of slack, you can make a pseudo-backpack with the rope ends tied back into the bundle. This may make for easier carrying if an actual backpack in unavailable, or if you want to put your climbing partner to work. Swing the whole thing onto your back and take the two pieces of slack and put one over each shoulder, then cross them across your chest. Put them under your arms and then around the back of the coil on your back, then back out around your waist. Tie a square knot to keep the coil in place. \n This is especially useful if the rope gets damp from snow. Never climb when it is raining, or has rained! Rock is more likely to break if it is wet, because it has all the extra weight from the water. \n If you have all the gear in your pack (crampons, backup rope, shoes, anchors, belay devices, carabiners, quick-draws, and trad gear) your partner can just sling the rope on his/her back, and off you go! \n 
 In order to produce creative ideas yourself, you will need a constant flow of new ideas.Seeing the work of others will inspire you, and give you ideas to challenge, change, or explore further. Try: \n Reading lots of books \n Keeping up with world news \n Subscribing to one or more magazines on topics that interest you \n Watching a documentary film on a topic you are unfamiliar with \n Visiting a museum\n You will need to be ready to write or sketch out an idea the moment inspiration strikes. For this reason, make sure to always have a sketchbook or notepad with you at all times.When you get an idea, try putting it down quickly in your note/sketchbook. You can always come back later and revise it. \n Try making yourself write or draw every day in your notebook, even if you don’t think you have any new ideas. In the long run, making a habit of working some in your notebook every day will lead to more creativity. \n In the modern world, it is very easy to be distracted by television, smartphones, social media, and a million other things. However, in order to think creatively, it is very important to sometimes be bored.Being bored causes your brain to work in new ways, as it seeks stimulation. This leads to fresh ideas. \n Give yourself a "device free" hour each day, or day per week \n Set aside some time each week in which you don't have anything scheduled \n When you start to feel board, such as when waiting for a subway, resist the urge to check a smartphone or other distraction. Instead, observe the world around you. \n For example, try playing: \n With children’s toys, such as blocks \n A favorite board or card game \n Charades \n For example: \n If you are inside, try going outside. If you are outside, try going inside. \n If you are working in a big room, move to a small room. If you are working in a small room, move to a big room. \n Visit a museum, go for a walk, go bowling, or find some other location you enjoy. \n If you are sitting, try lying on your back on the floor. \n Getting out of your comfort zone is an easy way to get a fresh perspective, and go back to the problem or project you are working on with a renewed sense of vigor. \n Have lunch at a new restaurant, or try a kind of food you’ve never had before. \n Talk a walk in an area you’ve never visited. \n Watch a film in a language you can’t understand. \n Read a book on a topic you know nothing about. \n Getting new skills, especially in an area separate from the one you are working in, will broaden your mindset and give you new ways of thinking through ideas. \n Learn how to play a musical instrument \n Practice a foreign language \n Try cooking a new cuisine \n Take up a new hobby, such as knitting, woodworking, or painting \n Learn how to play a sport or game you’ve never tried before \n Make time to talk to lots of different kinds of people, ask them questions about their work and ideas, or just chat. \n Have lunch with a coworker you haven’t had the chance to really talk with before. Ask him or her about the work he or she does. \n Strike up a conversation with a stranger on the bus, train, plane, etc. \n Pretend that you are talking to someone you find fascinating or a role model, such as a famous or influential person from history. Close your eyes, and discuss with this person whatever topic comes to mind. \n Being creative requires you to suspend judgment and take risks.If you start judging ideas before you even get started, you will crush your creative spirit. Let your ideas flow, and only worry about editing them once you get them out. \n Write nonstop for a certain amount of time (for instance, 10 minutes). By writing without stopping, no matter what comes out, after a few minutes you will start to access new and fresh ideas that you wouldn’t have thought of at first. \n It requires visual organization and logical organization, which engages your whole brain and encourages creativity. \n Start with a piece of paper and pen or marker. Write down the concept you are working (for example, “Clothing”) with in the middle of the paper and put it in a shape like a circle or square. \n Draw lines off of the center to create new shapes with related concepts. For example, you could draw a line from “Clothing” to have a space for “Hats” and another with a space for “Shirts” \n Draw new lines off of these subcategories to make sub-sub-categories. For example, draw a line for “Flannel” off of “Shirts.” \n One way to get your creative juices flowing is to challenge accepted ways of understanding things. You can do simple exercises to practice this, as a way of getting ready to think creatively about a problem or project. For example, take an everyday object, like a paper clip, and think of ten new uses for it.Normally, a paper clip is used to fasten loose papers together. However, you could also: \n Stick paperclips in the ends of corn so you can eat it off the cob \n Use a chain of paperclips as a necklace \n Use a paperclip to open a stubborn seal, such as on a medicine bottle \n Use a paperclip as an instrument to paint intricate designs on your fingernails using nail polish. \n It can be used as a practice exercise to boost creativity or when you are working on a project. “Toppling” is one technique to practice free association:Think of a word, any word, such as “potato.” \n Think of another word that is related to it, but not the same kind of thing (in this case, not a vegetable). For example, “chip” (“potato chip”). \n Continue by again making an association between the last word and a new one, such as “paint” (“paint chip”). \n Repeat the same step to find a new word, such as “wallpaper” (an alternative to paint) \n Keep repeating this procedure, always trying to find words that are related in different ways. \n These require you to think about similarities between objects or concepts, often ones that are not related in an obvious way. They often take the form of “X is to Y as A is to B.” Start by thinking of objects, and form analogies: \n “A potato is to a french fry as a tree is to a board” (french fries are made from parts of potatoes; boards are made from parts of trees) \n “A tree is to a forest as sand is to a desert” (forests are made of lots of trees; a desert is made of lots of sand) \n 
\n It should be located close to your AC compressor. This feeds the unit the voltage necessary for it to run. Often you will see a cable running from this breaker box directly to the AC compressor. \n There is a latch on the box (either on the side or bottom) that unlocks it. Once the door is in the open position, push it in slightly and it should lock in place. \n Set the breaker aside in a safe place. \n Use the appropriate bit with a bit driver to remove the screws. Typically there are four 5/16" hex screws that attach the side panel to the rest of the unit. Place the screws in a secure location so as not to lose any. \n It will have a cylindrical, canister-like shape. It will have three terminals on top. There will be colored wires coming from the AC Unit to some if not all of the terminals on the capacitor. \n The top of the run capacitor should be perfectly flat. If you see that the top side is bulging upwards in any way, it needs to be replaced. If this is not the case, a faulty capacitor may not be the source of the issue. You may need to contact your local HVAC professional. \n The three terminals on the capacitor are labeled HERM, FAN, and C. Take a picture with your smart phone to record how everything is installed to make sure the new capacitor is connected in the same way. Jotting down these details on a piece of paper will also work. \n Inspect your insulated flat-head screwdriver. A properly insulated screw driver should have a entirely rubber handle. Ensure the handle has no exposed metal parts or cracks., To do this you are going to create a bridge between the C terminal and the HERM/FAN terminals, one at a time, using the metal part of the screwdriver. Ensure you are not touching anything metal. With the metal part of the screwdriver, touch a metal prong on the C terminal AND another from the HERM terminal at the same time, creating a bridge between the two. This may produce a shock. Do this two more times to ensure the terminals were completely discharged. Do the same to the C and FAN terminals. \n Use the appropriate bit and the bit driver to remove the screws. These are typically two 1/4" hex screws but this may vary. Set the screws and the bracket in a secure location. \n To be safe, always treat the capacitor terminals as live terminals. Remove the old capacitor., They can be purchased at your local HVAC Supply Store or they can also be purchased online through Amazon, eBay, etc... The simplest way to make sure you buy the correct one is to order the same model number from the same manufacturer. There are occasions where another brand might be more affordable. In this case you want to make sure to match the specifications on the old capacitor. \n Attach the appropriately colored wires according to how they were placed on the old capacitor., Plug the 220v breaker back in the ON position. Turn on the thermostat to cool. The AC unit should turn on within the next two to three minutes. Verify the unit is working properly. Do not attempt to reattached the AC unit's side panel while there is power running through it., Put the AC panel cover back on and secure it with the appropriate screws. Plug the 220v breaker back in and set the thermostat to cool. The repair is complete!
 This has a chip on it that contains the encryption key and uses it to encrypt the data on the drive. This is faster and more secure than the software alternative. Hardware encrypted drive have until recently been very expensive, but now several are available for not much more than a standard drive. \n If you already have a drive and would like to encrypt it there is a very powerful free software solution called TrueCrypt. The software is slightly slower and less secure (because the encryption is done by the PCs processor so the encryption key and data are transferred to the PCs memory where it is available later on to hackers. \n A problem with software flash drives is that they need admin rights on the host PC to work; thus, they cannot be used in public locations such as schools or internet cafes. We get around this problem by installing a “viewer” called TCExplorer. This does not need admin rights and lets you view as well as read and write files TrueCrypt encrypted files on public PCs: \n \n The main TrueCrypt window should appear. \n The main TrueCrypt window should appear. \n The TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard window will appear. Choose: "Create an Encrypted file container," and Choose: "standard TrueCrypt volume." As the option is selected by default, you can just click Next. \n The standard Windows file selector should appear (while the window of the TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard remains open in the background). \n In the file name box, click any name you like, e.g. "secure." This will be the name of the file that contains your encrypted data (also called a “container”). TrueCrypt will create this file for you. Do not choose an existing file or it will be overwritten. \n Leave the defaults and click next. \n Then click next. \n Type in and confirm a password with case changes and a combination of letters and numbers. Then click next. \n Volume format leave as FAT or change to NTFS for volumes larger than 2GB \n You now have a secure container on your USB flash drive. Navigate to your USB flash drive, TrueCrypt folder and click on truecrypt.exe. In the top menu, go to tools, then traveler disk setup. \n Then click on close. \n Unzip this file and copy TCexplorer.exe to the root of your USB drive. Now you have a working encrypted drive. You can copy to and from it directly when you have admin rights on the host computer and you can do the same by clicking on TCExplorer when you do not have admin rights. \n 
 Treat this step just as you would if hiring a new employee. Making a bad decision regarding which contractor to hire will be very painful. Give yourself the best opportunity to make a good decision here by including several candidates before moving to step 2. \n \n If you are unsure of the business licenses required for roofing contractors in your area, contact the licensing board or Department of Professional Regulation for your area or state. \n You may also visit the Contractor's Licensing website featured in the Sources section of this article to determine the licenses required by specific states. \n \n Not all areas or states require roofing contractors to have insurance, but you may want to hire a person with insurance to protect yourself from lawsuits if the contractor is injured while working on your property. \n Check with the contractor to verify that the insurance covers the entire time-span during which the roofing project takes place. \n \n You can also research the roofing contractor's reputation by contacting your state's Department of Professional Regulation or a local Better Business Bureau (BBB). Visit the BBB website listed in the Sources section of this article or call them at 703-276-0100 in the United States and at 514-905-3893 in Canada. \n \n Some types of roofing may require contractors to have special training, certifications, or licenses to ensure proper installation. \n \n Information to ask for should include the length of the project, daily start and end times, roofing materials to be used, safety procedures, the amount of payment and payment schedule, and clean-up methods. \n \n Do not hire roofing contractors based solely on the lowest pricing bids because they may not provide the same value as contractors with slightly higher pricing. \n 
 Afrikaans is a young Germanic language which has a much simpler grammar than English and Dutch. It is not only spoken by (77% of all) coloured and (58% of all) white people in South Africa, but also 11 different cultural groups speak Afrikaans as a home, second or third language. Today, the Flemish, Dutch, Germans, Anglophonic peoples, Swedes and even Polish and Russians are rather keen to get in touch with what is known as the simplest Germanic language in the world.\n Because Afrikaans sounds quite guttural, it is also the perfect language to swear in! Lots of South Africans use it for this purpose only! Which is kind of sad, but it is certainly a very expressive language in other words. However, if the user are interested in learning Dutch, Afrikaans makes an excellent basic stepping stone. \n Which means "good morning". Nobody says that anymore. It is old-fashioned. When we greet someone we just say "Hallo" or "Hi" or something similar like "môre" which means "morning". Afrikaans has been influenced a lot by English. \n The "Hoe" is pronounced like "who" in English and means "how". The 'g' sound in the beginning of "gaan" is made in the back of the throat. That is the hardest sound in Afrikaans. In order to pronounce this letter, make like a car that suddenly hits the brakes on a gravel road. A scratchy sound, like if you've got something stuck in your throat and want to get it out. after you think you've got it try the whole word: "gaan". The 'aan' part is pronounced like "on" in English. "gaan" means "goes" and can be used in all tenses which will often require a prefix or suffix. Finally the word "dit" which means "it" in English. "dit" is pronounced like the first syllable in the urban word "ditto" so it's "dit"//"to" but only the first part. Also the 'i' is pronounced "uh". Finally say the three words in sequence: Hoe Gaan Dit? Which if directly translated into english would basically mean "How Goes It?" there you have it. \n The thicker the volume, the better. English-Afrikaans, Nederlands-Afrikaans (better known as ANNA) and Deutsch-Afrikaans bilingual dictionaries are already available. Trilingual dictionaries for African languages-Afrikaans are also available, though not very extensive. \n It is important to know idiomatic expressions, otherwise you won’t grasp the humor. Luckily though, if you know Dutch, or know a few Dutch expressions, most idiomatic expressions will be comprehensible. Also, especially nowadays, people directly translate English proverbs. \n You should listen to Afrikaans more often. To give you some idea how an Afrikaans accent sounds like, visit http://af.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoofstad on the Afrikaans Wikipedia, click on the speaker and read along . In this way, you can read and listen to the article simultaneously. As you would listen to Radio Nederland Wereldomroep just to get familiar with the Algemeenbeschaafde Dutch accent – use Radio Sonder Grense (RSG) for Afrikaans. At the homepage, place the cursor on Luister, and then Luister Weer. Click Luister Weer. You may select any program that you think you will like (e.g. Die tale wat ons praat), ignore Sleutelwoord and Datums; click on and click LAAI AF at any particular day’s topic you want. After the sound file has been downloaded, you may listen for ± half an hour, at your own leisure, how Afrikaans words are pronounced. Afrikaans is a fast language, which is why you should be able to replay the podcast. \n The Afrikaans community is fueled by humor. Most of it are puns (using Afrikaans idiomatic expressions and words), irony, rhyme, similes, metaphors, exaggerations, understatements and innuendos. If the Afrikaans speaking people start giggling or laughing when you speak Afrikaans, don’t take it personally or seriously at all – if you are a male, your voice tone might sound rather feminine (many don’t articulate deep and raspy enough from the throat, but speak softly from the front of their mouths) or very awkward. If you are female, you probably used the wrong expressions. You’ll get the hang of it. Just keep on practicing. \n South Africa and Namibia are sunny countries. Biometeorology and psychology has the theory that the amount of sun exposure has an influence on human behaviour. In parallel with other sunny Mediterranean South European and South American peoples, Afrikaans speaking people are much, much less reserved and much more talkative, emotional and interactive than Northern Europeans. If they are happy, shocked, sad, frustrated, passionate or overjoyed, the facial expression, voice tone, body language and hand gestures tells it all. To show emotion is not a weakness, it shows you are human – and is therefore a virtue. They’re not living in the science-fiction film, Equilibrium. \n When it comes to gender, Afrikaans and the Afrikaans culture (like most other African cultures) has always been patriarchal. Some argue that the Afrikaans culture is fundamentally based on religion, while others argue that the lack of First World infrastructure and education cannot sustain acculturation to First World countries; which also includes social equality. Men have their traditional gender roles, and so do women. Respect it. In modern South Africa, there are but a few Afrikaans speaking feminists who want to change the image of Afrikaans culture, though most Afrikaans speaking women (especially those inside a marriage) complain: Vandag se mans is regtig pap! Waarom moet ’n vrou altyd die broek in die huis dra? (Today’s men are utterly sloppy and pathetic! Why should a woman always wear the trousers at home? .) Keep this in mind when speaking. \n Afrikaans doesn’t have any gender for a neutral object, such as a table, ship or car; just like English. Die/ dit is used: Die motor wil nie vat nie. Dit werk nie. . \n However, if a gender must be added towards, say, a ship, car or table, it is always masculine. Jy moet die tafel vernis / motor was / skip laat nasien, hy lyk verwaarloos. (You must varnish the table / wash the car / service the ship, he looks dilapidated.) \n Any animal of which the sex is unknown, is always masculine; an animal is not an “it”. “Daardie hond daar oorkant– het hy hondsdolheid?” Don’t ever call someone on their first name, unless permitted to do so. \n If a minor calls you oom or tannie , accept it with gratitude. It is a form of respect. This title is usually given to someone who is 10 years older + than they are. \n In a business environment, the title comes first, followed by the surname. If you don’t know a woman’s marital status, just use dame (Madam). The register is formal at the first meeting, but may become more informal as the business partners build a better working relationship. \n Important – Don’t use jy en jou (informal you) to someone much older than you are. It is very disrespectful and the person will most likely take it as an offensive gesture, for the two of you are not from the same age group(Note1). In this case, try not to use any pronouns at all, or use u (formal you). \n (Note1) In Europe and other First World Continents, there are less youth than elderly people. Therefore age egalitarianism is being utilized (as the youth are the odd ones out). In South Africa and other Third World Countries, there are less elderly people than youth. Therefore, the hierarchal pyramid persists (as the elderly people are the odd ones out). \n In this way, you will also get in contact with the different Afrikaans dialects. \n Latinized words also sound long (having too much syllables) and dreary. Rather use short Germanic words and short sentences instead. Words that the typical man on the street will understand. For example, don’t use offisieel (official) instead of amptelik, like in Afrikaans is ’n amptelike taal van Suid-Afrika. (Afrikaans is an official language of South Africa). For a list for some of these words, go to: http://af.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lys_van_minder_suiwer_Afrikaanse_woorde . Difficult for the English and Romance language speaker? Sure do. But wait, there’s another way out… \n What?! Yes! After all, you’re probably not going to be a news reader or television personality. Perhaps an Afrikaans rock star... Afrikaans people use English words to lubricate a sentence (make it speak more fluently and faster), or if an Afrikaans equivalent term doesn’t pop up that quickly. There is a difference between formal office/document language and the informal conversation language (diglossia). So, feel free. Most Afrikaans speakers will notice you are not familiar with their language and won’t bite your head off. There are only a few cases of purists-extremists; but they are only one in every ten thousand. \n If the Afrikaans speakers notice that you are struggling with Afrikaans, they will automatically switch to English (or maybe an African language you might know) – they are only trying to accommodate you. But you have to put your foot down and demand Afrikaans. Otherwise, you’ll never learn through trial and error. They’ll gladly help you. \n A large number of lyrics of popular songs are available on the Net and some of the contemporary artists’ music videos are played on YouTube. On the sites you can also search for Kurt Darren, Snotkop, Steve Hofmeyr, Juanita du Plessis, Nicholis Louw, Sorina Erasmus, Chrizaan, Bobby van Jaarsveld, Chris Chameleon, Ray Dylan, Bok van Blerk, Emo Adams, Arno Jordaan, Gerhard Steyn and Robbie Wessels, Jay, Eden etc. Some of the other modern individuals and groups are Jack Parow, Fokofpolisiekar, Die Antwoord, Die Heuwels Fantasties, Glaskas, Die Tuindwergies etc. Since the early 2000s it seems as though everyone has literally jumped on the bandwagon. Every week a new Afrikaans artist arrives on the scene; and the Afrikaans music industry caters for almost every genre, but most prominently the rock genre. The reason for this fertile ground is because Internet piracy of Afrikaans music is particularly very low, and, therefore, gives the artists the chance of making money. \n Before television in 1976, the World Wide Web in 1995, MXit in 2005 (a cellular phone chat application) and especially Facebook, people either went to the theatres, cinemas (alias bioskoop) participate in sports or read books. There was a boom of books especially from the 1950s – 1970s, but interest declined onwards as time progressed. The best sellers today are recipe books and Christian literature, followed by romantic fiction, detective stories, autobiographies and poetry. Schools are the major stimulators of the children’s literature book market, mainly because prescribed books for the curriculum are being purchased. Because it is rather pricey (and risky) today being an author in Afrikaans, most aspirant authors test their skills on Woes.co.za. Have a look over there. \n http://afrikaans.news24.com/; Die Burger.com (for Cape Provinces); Volksblad.com (for Free State) and Beeld.com (covers the earlier Transvaal) has all the latest South African and international news in Afrikaans. Republikeinonline.com.na has all the latest Namibian and international news in Afrikaans. Though it should be added that newspapers tend to be bugged by language errors, clichés, jargon and Anglicism, it’s a good way of picking up neologisms and to get in closer contact with the Afrikaans speaking community. \n From January 2010 Roepman, Jakhalsdans, Ek lief jou, Ek joke net, Die Ongelooflike Avonture van Hanna Hoekom, Liefling, Getroud met Rugby and Platteland has been released. English subtitles included. Important: Though most of the films’ setting are in rural places (such a cliché!), don't be fooled: the Afrikaans community are well urbanized. \n Get streetwise at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_South_African_slang_words \n Other than the anti-egalitarianism issue, the Afrikaans community is not fastidious about choice of words and are constantly simplifying the rules. Enjoy! \n 
\n Assess your comfort level with what the owner. Do they take the time to treat you like family? Spend time conversing with the owner and ask a lot of questions. \n Choose homes where you can actually email prior renters. Ask about cleanliness, if the home was as advertised, was pool heat as promised, if the owner was available when needed, etc. \n While many folks feel uncomfortable not having the actual address of the home ahead of time, think of this: How would you like to stay in a vacation home when the entire world knows you’re vacationing and probably will be at Disney most of the time. Not a real good idea! Be satisfied with the general locality. \n Pay the deposit by credit card. If difficulty arises, this will enable you to challenge charges. \n (Of course, a deposit will be required up front, but if you have accomplished our other tips, that is OK.) \n It is not wise to place trust in a not so well paid employee of a management company to make sure you vacation needs are met, and met in a timely fashion. \n Be sure you get the same answers. \n You'll be surprised how many are not. \n If you are not a smoker, be certain to obtain a guarantee that the house is smoke-free. The same holds true for pets. If you are allergic to animals, make certain that no animals have been allowed in the rental home. \n 
 There is no magic number or time at which a person is ready for dating. It's dependent on who you are, how mature you feel and what your parents think about it too. Indeed, it's a combination of factors. At this point, don't feel bad if you don't actually feel like dating yet––that's okay to, you can have friends instead of dates too and nobody will think any the worse of you for it. \n Take a little time to better understand your own motivations for having a boyfriend or going out. How big a factor is each of the following for you: wanting friendship/companionship and someone to hang out with; wanting to have someone else interested in your well-being and listen to your worries and joys; wanting affection (hugs, touch and nonphysical affection, romance, etc.); wanting to be accepted and cool and not seen as a loner by schoolmates? Which of these are your main motivators? The better you understand your own needs and motives, the better your decisions and choices will be about whether to ask a boy out, and if so, who to ask, and how to do it. \n Taking the time to introspect and understand yourself better is a lifelong process important for adults as well as for middle school students.\n If they don't think that dating boys is appropriate right now, they mean it and they have good reasons. Listen to them and just find friends instead. There's plenty of time for love later. \n If you're parents are cautious but open to the possibility, explain how responsible you'd be if you went on a date, such as meeting curfew times, letting them know where you are going and being reachable by phone at all times. \n Ask them what they think about dating and how comfortable they feel about it. While you don't need to agree with what they say or think, it can be helpful to gauge their feelings and get ideas to form your own thoughts. \n Once you're happy that you're ready to date, try getting to know this boy better. \n He might not turn out to be the kind of person you first thought. It makes good, common sense to get to know him a little before asking him out. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways you can use to get to know this great person somewhat better. \n Make it a group thing. Get your friends and his friends to mingle at recess, lunch and after school. Make it all seem most casual, and just hang about chatting to everyone, including him. \n Make friends with him and his friends. It will make him feel closer to you without realizing just yet what your real intentions are. This gives you the space to study him close up and kindly. \n Have casual conversations with him about school, sport, your uniforms, school rules, anything really that is simple, relevant and easy to chat about. \n Find out what interests him and let him know just a little about what interests you. \n Here are some conversation starters: "Want some gum?" "Hey, do you have any gum?" "Okay, no more projects on cells. Mine looked like it came out of a horror movie!" or "Random Question: are you a morning or night person?". If you are in different years/grades, ask him what he thinks you'd like next year. \n Don't chew his head off with "me, me, me" talk though. Instead, make the aim to learn as much as you can about him. He'll ask you enough things in time. \n Give him little gifts now and then, such as chocolates. But be sure to give them to his and your friends at the same time. You're trying to prove you're a generous lassie, not someone focused only on him––that comes shortly. For now, show him what a great spirit of generosity you are. \n Send a friend request and bond online. Send casual messages, jokes, funny pictures and nice sayings. Keep it light and friendly and include your other friends initially so that he looks like he's just one among many recipients of your online banter. As time goes on, you may grow to feel comfortable just chatting or messaging him. \n He doesn't want to know what you're doing every five seconds and he certainly doesn't want to have answer to you about what he's doing every five seconds. Instead, just get to know his schedule, work around it with the occasional "hello", "how's it going" and "wow, isn't funny how we keep bumping into each other?" moments. \n If you're online, take the chance to now and then send something with a "when I saw this, it made me think of you, 'coz I know you like the LOL cat/etc. pictures". \n Do you want him to be your boyfriend? Before you ask him out, be sure he's the one. Before you decide that you're in love, know what your own feelings are. Make a list of the negatives and positives about him, and then decide. \n At least have inkling that this guy has grown fond of you and is somewhat into you. Signs include him breaking the touch barrier, lingering gazes, fond nicknames, making excuses to be near you, texting or messaging you a lot, blowing you kisses and generally being sweet to you. In some cases, he might be a little more brash and teasing toward you, because he feels comfortable around you. If you've gotten the impression that he's keen, it might be time. Ask him when you feel right and comfortable! \n If so, flirt a little, make eye contact more often and pass a few sweet notes to him in class. Make it clear that you're keen on him. \n He's yours for the taking if you've noted the signs correctly and feel you know him well enough by now. \n Rehearse asking. If it helps you to gain confidence, practice beforehand. First, write down what you want to say. Then, practice in the mirror. Look at your body language and facial expressions. Practice until you feel confident. \n This is especially important at the middle school and junior school levels. This isn't about determining your love match for life; it's about gaining a fun and carefree romantic friendship and the main thing is that you both feel comfortable with one another. \n Say something like, "Want to go for a slurpee over lunch break?". This is perfect. Make sure his lunches are free first. \n Or, casually ask "So do you have band/yearbook/practice, etc. today? Mind if I come too". \n Or, "Hey, would you like to come with me to the movies/park/skate rink, etc. this weekend?" \n If asking him out over text message, say something like: "My friends think we should get married. Spring wedding sound good?" Expect a "lol" as a response. Then after he responds, say something like, "Yeah, but I really do like you." Do try to use full words as often as possible; text messages can look really stupid if you use text language (u for you, r for are). \n Realize that he may need time to process your request to get together, hang out or go on a date, and that's fine. Let him know it's fine and that he can get back to you. \n If he says no, that's all right. He's probably embarrassed, or he hasn't made up his mind. Be understanding, and don't become defensive or act hurt. Never stall or make excuses. But at least he knows you like him and he might start looking at you in a different way. \n If he says yes, say "great" and start planning your date, make sure you pay, unless he insists. Some guys love it when the girl pays, it makes them feel loved, others feel guilty and feel like their being given sympathy. \n Bite your head off? No he will either say yes, no or I'll think about it (if the later, don't let him leave you hanging indefinitely; move on). Only ask if you really like him! Don't do it if you're just making it up! If he gives you something, try to give him something back the next day. \n He may be with his friends more often than when he is with you. This is normal, and part of a healthy relationship! \n If he sees that you care and want to see him more often, he may become more committed to the relationship. (Try to have a few activities in mind to do together, like playing video games, baking brownies, watching a favorite show or movie, shooting hoops at the nearest basketball goal, etc.) \n Depending on the sort of guy he is, if he comes around to your house, find a comfy spot and lean in. Boys love kissing! However, if you aren't comfortable, don't force yourself. \n You want to keep in touch with him, but not 24/7! He might think you're a nag, or that you don't trust him. Text him once or twice a day, if he responds, YAY! But you can't expect him to. Also, if you see him in the hallway just say hi. If he stops you to talk, stay there and have a short conversation or tell him you'll talk to him at lunch. \n If he is mean, cruel, or disinterested, just move on. He may be cute or cool, but it's just not worth being mistreated to try to pursue him. Pick someone new to like. Always remember that boys don't control your happiness. \n 
 Cotton and felts work best, but you can make this from nearly any material once you get the hang of it. \n from your fabric. The shapes should be approximately 2 inches (5cm) long and one inch (2.5cm) wide. \n Important: Make all of the football shapes exactly the same size, and allow an extra 1/4 inch (1/2 cm) for the seams. \n 12 shapes from each of three different colors works very nicely for this project. \n If sewing by hand, take care to make your stitches very small and even to prevent problems later. \n Note: Begin and end the seam a seam allowance width from the point to prevent bunching when sewing and turning. \n With right sides facing, sew one long edge together., This will create a three sided wedge which resembles a (somewhat fat) orange section. \n If using three fabrics, use one fabric per side of your wedges so that you can "change colors" on the ball later. \n \n Almost done... just one set of points left to be sewn. \n \n Add embellishments such as buttons or ribbon ties if you like, but be aware that you should not give a button encrusted ball to a very small child who may choke on the buttons. \n 
, If your breast is over-flowing in your cups, or your bra cups are cutting into your breast tissue, then it's time to induce a larger cup size or a completely different bra design with a fuller cup. The edges of the cups should lie flat on your breast. If the bra cup is pointy, and the design wasn't meant to be thus, then you wish to scale back the cup size. \n If your bra underwire is facing outward from your body, this is often an indication that your push up bra cup size is simply too little. Additionally, how far away your breasts are from each other will have an effect on how the middle panel seats on your sternum. \n The lower the bra band fits on the back, the higher the support can be. Ladies with spinal arch can have issues with where the bra band will work on their back. \n If your bra straps are carrying a lot of than ten%, you need a smaller bra band size. Ladies with slanting shoulders need to buy bras with specific styles and special features, or bra accessories that help keep the bra straps up and on the shoulders. \n It ought to additionally give a well-outlined breast shape. Keep in mind that we tend to aren't living at zero gravity; therefor bra cup made from stretchy material might be comfy; however the form and support of your breast can be compromised. \n If your wires curve faraway from your chest in the middle, this usually means that that your bra cup size is simply too tiny. However, your breast size, form and uniqueness, will definitely affects how the underwires bra fits. \n An uplifted breast seems abundant younger and gives a higher appearance. \n If for any reason the arms a bumping against the side of the breast, then it's time for a different bra or size. \n If you're having problem placing your finger beneath the band, then you need to alter the hook position, or get a bigger band size. \n Or it is time for you to form some adjustment to that bra yourself (I saw my mama do it along with her hands, needle and thread). \n 
 The employee handbook should include a general introductory paragraph that outlines the purpose of the handbook. You should welcome the employee to the company and discuss the company’s goal of being a rewarding place to work for employees. You should also reiterate the importance of the employer/employee relationship.For example, you may state: “We at are confident you will find our company is a dynamic and engaging place to work, and we look forward to your contribution to our continued success. We consider our employees to be our most valuable resource. This handbook will serve as guide for the relationship between employer and employee.”\n You should also make sure the introduction to the handbook contains a disclaimer that the handbook is not a legal, binding contract between employer and employee. This will help to prevent legal disputes and protect your company in the event of a legal issue in the future.For example, you may state: “This handbook only contains general information and guidelines. It is not a binding legal contract and does not act as a contractual right to remain employed by the company.” \n This is another important disclaimer that should be included in the employee handbook. You should make sure you state that your company is not obligated to retain employees and note that an employee can be dismissed at the discretion of the company. This will ensure the handbook is not seen as a contract by employees or cannot be used as such in a court of law.For example, you may state: “Your employment may be terminated at any time with or without cause and without prior notice by the company. You may also resign at any time.” \n You should also include an acknowledgement page that needs to be acknowledged and signed by the employee. This will ensure the employee has agreed to the terms of the handbook and signifies the employee understands the policies in the handbook.You can find samples of an acknowledge page for employees through the Society for Human Resource Management website and the National Federation of Independent Business website. \n Most federal and state governing bodies require companies to provide a clear, detailed wage policy in the employee handbook. Each state has different employment laws and require you to include different information about employee wages in the handbook. Get familiar with your state’s laws to ensure you cover all the requirements.You may need to check the federal laws for employers through the U.S. Department of Labor website, or your country’s applicable Department of Labor website. Make sure you are clear about the requirements for your company’s handbook before you outline any policies or expectations. \n Your employee handbook should note your legal obligations on pay schedules and overtime pay. Your employees should know how often they are getting paid as well as if they get paid for overtime work. You should outline the expected work hours for your employees, depending on if they are full-time or part-time.Include descriptions of exempt and non-exempt employees. Exempt employees are typically upper-level management and are excluded from laws governing minimum wage, overtime, and other wage practices.Your description should include the definition of overtime. For example, working longer that 9 hours per day, 40 hours per week, holidays, etc. Be sure to mention that travel time or prep time to be ready for work are compensated. \n You should also note your company’s policy on coffee breaks and lunch breaks, such as how long each employee is allowed for these breaks. This will ensure your employees know what to expect in terms of managing their time. \n In the employee handbook you should also discuss the compensation packages your company offers its employees. This may include bonuses, stock options, and salary increases over time. Make sure you offer compensation packages that are realistic and affordable for the company, as you may need to follow through on these commitments in the future., Your company may be required by state or federal law to offer employee benefits like health benefits, dental benefits, and life insurance. These employee benefits should be briefly outlined in the handbook. You should not go into specific detail as your benefits policies may change and you do not want to put outdated or incorrect information in the handbook.Make sure you should mention who is eligible for benefits, such as full-time employees, part-time employees, and their families and spouses. You should also explain the criteria for enrolling in benefits and when you can change benefits, such as in the event of marriage or the birth of a child. \n Your benefits guide should also include details of any company-sponsored retirement or savings plan. Make sure to include any relevant policies such as contribution matching or vesting periods. \n For companies where employees may be required to use their personal property or travel for business purposes, you will need to outline the policy for company reimbursement of these expenses, if any. Be clear on which expenses are the responsibility of the company and which the responsibility of the employee. Outline the process of gaining approval for reimbursement and listing expenditures., Under federal law, you are required to have leave policies in place. You must have a family medical leave providing employees with up to 12 weeks unpaid leave for the birth or care of a child, to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition, or if the employee develops a serious medical condition. You should check your state’s policies for unpaid family leave.You should also explain the company’s policies for holiday leave, such as how much holiday time a year employees are given as part of their employment. You should outline the amount of time allowed for the death of a family member and for sick leave. \n Make sure you discuss your company’s vacation leave policy, including how vacation time is earned and how to request time off. You should include a list of holidays observed by the company, with clear details about when the company closes or stays open during holiday times. \n The employee handbook should outline the values and expectations you would like to see in your employees. You should discuss how you would like employees to behave and communicate in the workplace. You should also note a contact person that employees can speak to if they have any questions or clarifications.You should also maintain a positive and encouraging attitude in your discussion of employee expectations. This will keep your employees engaged in the handbook and make it feel accessible to them. \n For example, you may note, “We expect our employees to adhere to a high standard of professional conduct and integrity. As an employee, you should be respectful and courteous to the feelings and needs of others. Individuals who act inappropriately or unprofessionally may be subject to disciplinary action.” \n If your workplace has a specific dress code, you should include it in the employee handbook. Make sure you are clear about the requirements for the dress code and specify the company’s expectations for how employees should appear in the workplace.For example, if your company has an office setting, you may have a business casual dress code. You may note that all employees are required to adhere to a business casual dress code and appear well groomed. \n Give visual example of acceptable clothing and grooming, since ideas may vary between social groups and generations. \n Include specific regulations about beards, visible tattoos, and head apparel that might be religious. \n If your employees are often in the field working on construction sites, for example, you may require your employees to wear safety gear or clothing at all times. You should outline these requirements in the handbook so employees are aware of how they should appear every day in the field. \n By law, many states require companies to have a clearly stated equal employment and non-discrimination policy in their employee handbook. You must clearly state that your company prohibits discrimination in the workplace.You should also make sure you discuss the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which specifies anti-discrimination against people with disabilities. You can find out more about the ADA on the Americans with Disabilities website. \n Your company should also have an anti-harassment policy that clearly states that no harassment under any circumstances is tolerated in the workplace. Often you are required by federal or state law to have these policies in place for your employees.You should have a process in place for filing a harassment complaint so employees know how to file a complaint and who to talk to about the issue. You may have a Human Resources representative who is responsible for addressing any harassment complaints in the workplace. \n You should also make sure your employee handbook includes a policy on how to use company computers and software appropriately in the office and off-premise. This is especially important if the majority of the employee work is done on company computers.Make sure you outline how employees can secure their electronic information and protect any passwords or company information on their computers. You should also note any safety measures you have in place to protect the privacy of your employees online and your business’s information. \n You should also have guidelines around appropriate use of the computer and what sites employees can and cannot access. You should make sure employees are clear on what sites the company network can be used to access and note the importance of keeping company information private when communicating through email. \n Note any security steps that might be viewed as an intrusion of employee's privacy, explaining why they are necessary for company security. \n You should also include details about how your employees are going to be reviewed on their performance in the workplace. You may put a performance review metric in the handbook or include general guidelines on how and when performance reviews will happen for your employees.For example, you may note that employees receive yearly reviews and that positive reviews usually lead to a salary increase or a bonus. You may also discuss disciplinary action that may occur if the employee does not receive a positive performance review, such as a probationary period for the employee, followed by a second performance review or termination. \n In particular, note any conduct that might result in immediate dismissal, such as drug and alcohol use, theft, harassment, violence, or other serious offenses. \n Your employees should be aware of all security measures on your premises, including security cameras, detectors, and guards. Include any operating procedures required for getting through security. Describe any off-limits or restricted-access areas, along with a clear description of who is or is not allowed to enter them. For clarity, you may wish to include a map showing these areas., You may be required to comply with Occupational Health and Safety laws in your state and you should mention these laws in your employee handbook. You should note that all employees must report all accidents, injuries, potential safety hazards, and any safety related issues to management.You should also have safety policies in place regarding poor weather or hazardous work conditions. This is especially important if your employees often work in the field or off site. \n You should also include a process for reporting incidents on the job, such as an injury while working or a robbery. Your employees should be aware of how they can report an incident and who they can speak to in the event of an incident.You may have a detailed process in the employee handbook for incident reporting or keep it more general. You may want to opt for a more general discussion if you think the reporting process may change in the future. \n You should also include a clear plan of action in the event of an emergency, such as a fire in the workplace or a natural disaster like flooding or severe weather. You should have an exit plan for employees to follow on a map in the handbook and discuss safety areas or points outside of the building., The employee handbook should be accessible and easy to read for every employee with a tone that is conversational rather than formal or stiff. Try to appeal to every employee by using a tone that is approachable and clear.You can do this by imagining the handbook is a conversation you are having with an employee as an employer. You should use a tone that is clear and friendly when you are talking to your employee, and stay away from formal or stiff language. \n Labor laws can be complex but this does not mean your employee handbook has to be littered with verbiage or jargon. Instead, go for clear language and simplified terms. Having legal terms that are difficult to understand may not protect your company legally in the end and will only alienate the employees that are reading the handbook.You should try to avoid using formal terms like “management” or “authority.” Instead, use “we” or “employer” so the employee does not feel overwhelmed. You want the tone to sound casual, as your employees are more likely to read the handbook in full if it appears friendly and engaging. \n Avoid putting in guidelines in the handbook that are overly demanding or unreasonable. You want the handbook to act as a useful guide for your employees and do not want to create rules that are difficult or impossible to achieve.You should also try to keep the handbook short and sweet, with just enough information to fulfill the state requirements for employee handbooks. You do not want to overwhelm your employees with information or with strict rules that are hard to follow. \n Your employee handbook is a crucial document that could be used in a legal dispute later by your employees. You should get the handbook reviewed by a lawyer or a legal review to make sure your wording is clear and you are not making your company liable for any legal issues in the future. Once it has been cleared by the legal review, it will be ready to distribute to new and current employees at your company.

 The higher your FICO score, which ranges from 300 to 850, the better interest rate you'll qualify for. The difference between a 4.5% interest mortgage and a 5% interest mortgage can mean tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. Get a free copy of your credit report so you can see what the lenders see on your credit history. Pay off credit cards and resolve any credit disputes or delinquencies. In general, scores between 650-700 will get the average rate. A higher score it will get a great .25% reduction, but a score below that will cause a significant increase in your interest rates.Sample Rates Based on your Credit Score \n Credit Range \n 600-650 (Check with your lender) \n Between 650-700 \n Between 700-750 \n Between 750-850 \n Sample Rate \n 6.00% \n 4.00% \n 3.90% \n 3.75% \n Total Amount Owed on a $175,000 Mortgage (30 Years) \n $377,716.83 \n $300,771.64 \n $297,150.97 \n $291,762.82 \n \n Apply to several lenders within a two week period so that the inquiries do not damage your credit report. Do this before contacting a real estate agent so you have a firm idea of what you can afford, and you don't accidentally fall in love with a that you cannot afford. \n Sellers love buyers who get pre-approved. Pre-approved buyers are almost always given the green light by lenders, meaning there's less risk for the deal to get scuttled in the end. \n Don't accidentally get pre-qualified instead of pre-approved. There's a difference. Pre-approval means that the lender is usually prepared to give you a loan after seeing your financial vitals. Pre-qualified only means that the lender is estimating what you could borrow. It doesn't mean you'll get a loan., Wait — why would I shop for a mortgage before deciding on a house? Isn't that totally backward?Not necessarily. Shopping for a mortgage before you decide on a house can be beneficial for one overriding reason: \n You'll know exactly how much you can borrow before you buy your home. Too many people fall in love with a home that they — well — can't afford. They struggle finding a mortgage that covers the cost of the home. Finding a mortgage first and a home second may seem less appealing, but it's twice as smart. You'll immediately be able to tell whether a home is in your price range or out of it. \n Think about the sort of down-payment you'll be able to afford. This should be part of your mortgage calculations, although you don't need to know for sure when shopping for a mortgage. Have a general idea in mind. More on this later in the article. \n "28 and 36" is a commonly used ratio. It means that 28% of your gross income (before you pay taxes) must cover your intended housing expenses (including principal and interest on the mortgage, as well as real estate taxes and insurance). Monthly payments on your outstanding debts, when combined with your housing expenses, must not exceed 36% of your gross income. Find each percentage for your monthly gross income (28% and 36% of $3750 = $1050 and $1350, respectively). Your monthly payments on outstanding debts cannot exceed the difference between the ($300) or else you will not be approved., If you qualify for a first time home buyer program, these often have much lower down payment requirements. These are offered by various states and local governments. You may also be able to access up to $10,000 from your 401(k) or Roth IRA without penalty. Ask your broker or employer's human resources department for specifics regarding borrowing against those assets. \n If you expect the buying of the house to be a simple, straightforward affair, then you'll probably only need a Realtor, the escrow company, and perhaps a mortgage broker. But then again, when do things ever go as expected? Hire an honest, reputable, (relatively) cheap lawyer if: \n The cost of the lawyer is a drop in the bucket compared to the total you are likely to spend for the home. \n The home you are buying is either in foreclosure or in probate, which means that the home is being distributed as part of a deceased person's estate. \n You suspect the seller might try to quickly back out of the deal or you don't trust them. \n Your state requires a lawyer at closing. Six states currently require a lawyer present.Talk to your state commission of real estate to find out if it's common practice in your state. It is also a good idea to check with an attorney before entering into a contract. \n The real estate agent should be: amiable, open, interested, relaxed, confident, and qualified. Learn the agent's rates, methods, experience, and training. In the United States, sellers pay the Realtor commission while buyers may pay a fee for having the Realtor represent them. Look for a Realtor who lives local, works full time, closes several properties per year, and has a reputation for being busy. Read more in How to Select a Realtor. \n A Realtor's job is to connect people who want to buy and sell a particular home. For this reason, a Realtor has an interest in selling homes. A very good Realtor will use her experience to sell the right home to the right buyer — you. A Realtor can tell you about the schools, nearby shopping, zoning of the property, construction nearby, ages and values of nearby properties, growth rate, and any other statistics on the area you may be interested in. \n When you do find your Realtor, go into exhaustive detail when describing what you want in a home — number of bathrooms and bedrooms, attached garage, land and anything else that may be important, such good lighting or yard space for the kids. \n A Multiple Listing Service will give you a feeling for what is on the market in your price range. Your agent can do this for you. \n If you sign up through a real estate agent, it is poor form to call the listing agent directly to see a house. Don't ask an agent to do things for you unless you're planning to have them represent you — they don't get paid until a client buys a house and it's not fair to ask them to work for free, knowing that you're not going to use them to buy your home! \n Most lenders suggest that you pay no more than 38% of your monthly income towards your mortgage and debts combined. This means, on any given month, no more than 38% of your paycheck goes to paying back loans. You should use an online Home Affordability Calculator to find your own sweet spot. However, for a good idea of the house you can afford, tally up your current monthly bills, including credit cards, student loans, etc, and compare them against your income in the following sheet:Finding a Mortgage you Can Afford Based on Current Bills and Income \n Income: $35,000 \n Income: $50,000 \n Income: $75,000 \n Income: $100,000 \n Monthly Bills: $0 \n Up to $187,000, or $1,050/mo \n Up to $264,000, or $1,500/mo \n Up to $391,938, or $2,225/mo \n Up to $520,000, or $3,000/mo \n Monthly Bills: $100 \n Up to $170,113, or $950/mo \n Up to $246,898, or $1,400/mo \n Up to $374,875, or $2,125/mo \n Up to $502,851, or $2,900/mo \n Monthly Bills: $500 \n Up to $101,859, or $550/mo \n Up to $178,644, or $1,000/mo \n Up to $306,621, or $1,750/mo \n Up to $434,597, or $2,500/mo \n Monthly Bills: $1,000 \n Should not buy house \n Up to $93,327, or $500/mo \n Up to $221,303, or $1,250/mo \n Up to $349,279, or $2,000/mo \n You probably already have a vague idea, but the angel's in the details. There are a couple things in particular that you and your family should give good thought to: \n What will you and your family need in several years?Maybe you're just a couple right now, but are there are plans for kids in the future? A home that snugly fit two people could be torturous for three or four. \n What tradeoffs are you willing to make? In other words, what are your priorities? Although we like to believe that buying a house can be straightforward, it's often a complex ordeal in which we're forced to compromise. Do you care more about a safe neighborhood and good schools over a big backyard? Do you need a big, workable kitchen more than a big luxurious bedroom? What are you willing to sacrifice when it's crunch time? \n Do you expect your income to increase over the next couple years? If your income has increased by 3% for several years in a row and you hold a secure job in a safe industry, you can probably rest assured that buying an expensive but still reasonable mortgage is possible. Many homebuyers buy relatively expensive and then grow into their mortgage after a year or two. \n Scout out what's available in the vicinity. Look at prices, home design, proximity to shopping, schools and other amenities. Read the town paper, if there is one, and chat with the locals. Look beyond the home to the neighborhood and the condition of nearby homes to make sure you aren't buying the only gem in sight. \n The area in which your home is located is sometimes a bigger consideration than the home itself, since it has a major impact on your home's resale value. Buying a fixer-upper in the right neighborhood can be a great investment, and being able to identify up-and-coming communities — where more people want to live — can lead you to a bargain property that will only appreciate in value. \n Pay attention to overall layout, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, kitchen amenities, and storage. Visit properties you're seriously interested in at various times of the day to check traffic and congestion, available parking, noise levels and general activities. What may seem like a peaceful neighborhood at lunch can become a loud shortcut during rush hour, and you'd never know it if you drove by only once. \n If you are unsure about the price, have the home appraised by a local appraiser, who also looks at comparables. When appraising a home, appraisers will look for comparable homes or “comps” in the area that have similar features, size, etc. If your home is more expensive than the comps, or the appraiser has to find comps in a different subdivision or more than 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km) away, beware! Never buy the most expensive house in the neighborhood. Your bank may balk at financing the home, and you probably won't see your home appreciate in value very much. If you can, buy the least expensive home in a neighborhood — as homes around you sell for more money than you paid, your home's value increases. \n This is not easy, and often impossible, but it doesn't hurt to try when making one of the biggest purchases in your life. Here are some things to keep in mind as you think about your offer: \n What are the seller's financial prospects? Are they in desperate need of money or are they sitting on a pile of cash? Cash-strapped sellers will be more likely to take an offer that undercuts their asking price. \n If the house is a flip, the seller is often less emotionally invested and wants to sell quickly. Have your agent call the seller's agent and find out what they want for the property. People flipping houses usually already have a number in mind. You can find out if a house is a flip by looking at sale records, if it sold recently (around a year ago) and for much less than it's listed for now, and looks upgraded, it's probably a flip. You can also look it up on Google Maps street view to get some insight as to what it looked like before. If it looked run down with boarded up windows, and now it's looking pretty nice, it's probably a flip. It can also help to reassure the seller that you can close quickly (if you really can!). \n How long has the home been on the market? Homes that have been on the market for longer periods of time can usually be bid down. \n Have they already bought another house? If the sellers aren't currently living in the house they're trying to sell, it may be easier to bid less than you otherwise might. \n Estimate the annual real estate taxes and insurance costs in your area and add that to the average price of the home you're trying to buy. Also add how much you can expect to pay in closing costs. (These take in various charges that generally run between 3 to 6 percent of the money you're borrowing. Credit unions often offer lower closing costs to their members.) Put the total into a mortgage calculator (you can find them online or make your own in a spreadsheet. If the figure is above 28% of your gross income (or whatever the lower percentage used by lenders in your situation) then you will have a hard time getting a mortgage. \n Determine whether you need to sell your current home in order to afford a new one. If so, any offer to buy that you make will be contingent on that sale. Contingent offers are more risky and less desirable for the seller, since the sale can't be completed until the buyer's house is sold. You may want to put your current house on the market first. \n Economics of supply and demand will sometimes force your hand. If many people are competing for few homes, be prepared to lead with your highest possible offer. Some homebuyers don't believe that you should lead with your highest offer, but you could easily find yourself being outbid and never get the chance to bid on your house. If you want to give yourself the best shot on a home that you really, really like, lead with a high bid. \n Although the guidelines for submitting offers may differ from state to state, this is usually how it goes: You submit your offer to your Realtor, who then forwards it to the seller's representative. The seller then decides to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer. \n Include earnest money with your offer. This is typically 1-5% of the offer. Once you sign an offer, you are officially in escrow, unless you cancel using an accepted contingency to the contract during the contingency period. During escrow (typically 30 to 90 days), your lender arranges for purchase financing and finalizes your mortgage. \n Consider putting an expiration time on your offer if you or your agent think it makes sense for that situation. For example, if you put a 24 hour expiration, you're only bound to that offer for 24 hours. This can put a little pressure on the seller to act quickly. \n A down payment establishes equity, or ownership, in a home. That's also money that you don't have to pay interest on. The more of a down payment you're able to make on your home, the less money you'll ultimately pay on your home. \n You may be expected to put down 10-20% of the appraised value of a home depending on your loan package. However, there are loan packages that allow you to put down much less. Note that the appraised value may be higher or lower than the selling price of the house. If you have $30,000 saved for a down payment, for example, you can use it as a down payment for a home between $300k (10% down payment) or $150k (20% down payment). Putting less down often, but not always, requires you to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), which increases your monthly housing cost but is tax deductible. However, 20% is the typical amount for not needing to pay PMI. \n If you can't afford a 10%-20% down payment on your home, but have good credit and steady income, a mortgage broker may assist you with a combination or FHA mortgage. FHA mortgages only require 3.5% down payment and there are other loan packages that require as little as 3% down. There are also USDA and VA loan that require no money down. Talk to your mortgage broker to find your best option. \n Request the following surveys and reports: inspection, pests, dry rot, radon, hazardous materials, landslides, flood plains, earthquake faults, sewer scope and crime statistics. (You will generally have 7-10 days to complete inspections — be sure that your agent explains this fully to you when signing the purchase and sales contract.) \n A home inspection costs between $150 and $500, depending on the area, but it can prevent a $100,000 mistake. This is especially true with older homes, as you want to avoid financial landmines such as lead-paint, asbestos insulation and mold. \n If you use the inspection results to negotiate down the price of your purchase, then include the portion of the inspection report that notes the deficiency to prove that it exists. \n Getting a home energy audit is an essential part of the home buying experience. Not knowing what it really costs to heat and cool a home is a potential financial disaster waiting to happen. Home buyers make "guesstimates" when figuring out a new home budget. These estimates can be significantly incorrect and place families into dire financial circumstances. \n This is usually conducted in an escrow office and involves signing documents related to the property and your mortgage arrangements. The packet of papers includes the deed, proving you now own the house, and the title, which shows that no one else has any claim to it or lien against it. If any issues remain, money may be set aside in escrow until they are resolved, which acts as an incentive for the seller to quickly remedy any problem areas in order to receive all that is owed. \n Consider using your real-estate lawyer to review closing documents and represent you at closing. Again, Realtors are unable to give you legal advice. Lawyers may charge $200-$400 for the few minutes they're actually there, but they're paid to look out for you. \n 
 Score tries by carrying the ball into Your opponent's try-zone, ( penalty tries can also be awarded from any infringements from the opposing team.) A try is worth 5 points. \n When a try is scored an opportunity is given to the scoring team to make a conversion kick which is worth 2 points. \n The other way of gaining extra points for Your team is with penalty kicks, this is awarded when a member of the opposing team breaks a rule or if the play of the game is stopped by more than one member of that team. a Penalty kick is worth 3 Points. \n The last method of gaining points is with a drop-goal attempt, the ball is played backwards to a back-row player who then attempts to place the ball in between the uprights during ongoing game play, this is also worth 3 points.\n If you get the ball into your opponent's try zone you get 5 points, as well as a chance to attempt a conversion kick for an extra 2 points. The winner is the one who scores the most points in 80 minutes of play. \n You have to touch the ball down to score in rugby. That means after you've entered the try zone the ball must be placed on the ground to score.You can also kick the ball through the uprights during free play (with a drop-kick only) or after the referee awards your team a penalty (place kick) for 3 points., To score tries, offense teams form big horizontal lines, passing sideways and backward until they expose a hole in the defense and push forward. This is the big rule to remember when playing rugby. You cannot pass the ball forward with your hands or it is an automatic penalty. Whenever passing, you usually pass the ball across your body to get power and throw the ball diagonally to your teammate. \n Dropping or bobbling the ball counts as a forward pass if it hits your hands then hits the ground in front of you. \n You can, of course, carry the ball forward. However, any passes by the hand cannot be forward., While you cannot ever throw a ball forward, you can kick it forward at any time. Once you kick the ball, any teammate that was behind you when you kicked it can run forward and get the ball without a penalty. Kicks are a great way to surprise a defense, or boot the ball way down the field to get your team out of trouble. \n Players can even kick it to themselves, chipping it over an opponent and running around to pick it up. \n You cannot kick the ball to a teammate who is already further down the field than you unless you run past them at some point. If a player was behind you at any time after your kick they can touch the ball. If not, they are offside., Rugby defense is all about making tackles. You can only hit the player currently holding the ball, and you cannot block or screen the other team or other players. When you tackle an opponent, your goal is to bring them to the ground as quickly as possible, preferably with teammates around to quickly help win the ball. General tackling rules include: \n You must tackle someone below shoulder height. \n You must wrap your hands around the player, not just spear them with your shoulder. \n You cannot pick up and drop players, especially on their head or neck. \n Once down, you must return to your feet before trying to win the ball from someone you've tackled., When a player goes down, they must release the ball. From there, either team can fight to win the ball off the ground and take possession. This usually takes place as a "ruck." A ruck is when 1-3 players from each team lock into one another, right above the ball (and tackled player), and push each other back and forth in an attempt to win possession. One player on each team stands behind the ruck and grabs the ball when it appears behind their rucking teammate's back foot. Because the tackled player can put the ball down wherever they want, the team that had the ball first usually controls it. There are a lot of rules and strategy for contesting a ruck, but some basic reminders include: \n Stay on your feet. A ruck is when at least two players lock shoulders above the ball and try and push the opponent away from the ball. You cannot reach in to grab the ball or push off the ground with your hands. \n Enter through the center. For safety reasons, you must enter a ruck straight up and lock in with the other team. You must be perpendicular to the end line, and your body must be straight over the ball. You cannot run into a ruck diagonally or from the side. \n Stay behind the back foot if not in the ruck. Once a ruck is formed, you must stay behind the back foot of your final teammate until the ball comes out, no matter what team gets it. The entire space of the ruck is a "neutral zone" that no players can enter it., When a penalty (such as passing it forward) is called for your team, you get several options of restarts, depending on the foul. One of the most common is a scrum, where both teams form into battering rams and connect over the ball. A scrum is essentially a test of strength. In a scrum, 8 players from each team weave themselves together in rows to create a unified mass. The two teams then go head-to-head, each pushing against the other, with a tunnel formed on the ground in between them. \n In a scrum, one team throws the ball in the center of the two teams and they push and hook each other to try and win the ball. \n Scrums suck all the biggest players to one area of the field, leaving the other seven players with much more free space. If your team wins it, you're often off for a big gain. \n Scrums are perhaps the most dangerous aspect of rugby, and you should not try them without a coach and well-trained, athletic players., If a ball goes out of bounds the referee will call for a line-out. A line-out is like a throw-in in soccer, except the ball must be thrown straight forward. Each team forms a line on the field around the thrower. The team that did not touch the ball last gets to throw it in. They then toss the ball straight in between the two teams, who lift each other up to try and win the ball. The game then restarts as normal. \n Teams often use signals and codes to win their own line-outs. Basically, a thrower will signal to their team when they will throw it, and their teammates will hoist a player into the air, out of reach of the other team, to grab the ball quickly., Each team is made up of two smaller sections, each with their own positions and strengths. Forwards take part in the scrum, and this is the only real difference between them an backs as far as rules go. However, forwards and backs have evolved their own specialties on the field, making each vital to success: \n Forwards/Packies: These are the big guys -- the bruisers and muscle-men who power the scrums and win most of your rucks. Forwards generally take short, powerful runs with the ball, pass less, and do the majority of tackling and defense. Generally thicker and stronger.Backs: The runners and speedsters. Backs form a long diagonal line on offense and pass the ball quickly down the line, to the outside of the field, where they can take on a defender 1v1. On defense they form a wall across the field to prevent enemy backs from breaking through. Generally quicker, backs are good kickers, have solid passing skills, and tons of speed/endurance., Watch local and professional teams’ matches or practices in order to see how the game is played. You can also watch matches on television or recordings such as DVDs. Watching how a game is played in real life or through recordings allows you to see the intricacies of the sport. \n There are a lot of small rules, specific situations, and intricacies to rugby that are impossible to learn without playing or watching. Ask questions of fans and/or the referee when confused, and keep learning each game each time you play. \n A good rugby throw is powerful and quick, which protects your teammate from a nasty tackle as they watch the ball approaching them. Practice throwing to your side, not in front of you. To get a good throw, use both hands and focus on accuracy first, hitting your teammates right in the chest every time. Once you feel accurate you can start working on a professional-looking spin. To throw from the right hand: \n Start with the ball horizontally in front of you. Place your right hand on the back third of the ball, so your palm faces down and your thumb towards your target. Place your left hand on the bottom left half of the ball, thumb pointing left. \n Bring the ball to your right side, keeping the point of the ball still roughly pointing at your target. \n Using your left hand for aim and right for power, bring the ball across your body and towards your target. \n As your hands are almost extended, curl your right hand back towards you, spinning the ball. \n Release the ball with both hands simultaneously, rotating your wrist completely over on the follow-through. Both arms should be fully extended and pointed at your target, and your arms should stay low, around belly height. the whole time., Tackling is a skill that can be developed over a lifetime, but the basics are simple. You want to let your whole body do the work, not just your arms, to protect yourself and to ensure that you bring the guy down. Practice doing the following steps near simultaneously -- keeping your head up, driving with the shoulder, wrapping your arms, and driving to the ground: \n Set up on the balls of your feet. Make sure you are in a good athletic position for the hit -- knees bent, muscles relaxed, on your toes. \n Keep your head up and aim for their thighs/stomach. Keep your head up to see contact coming and line up the hit. This is a crucial step for safety. \n Aim to make contact with your shoulder right at their upper thigh. Slide your head next to their butt to keep it safe and drive in with your shoulder. \n Wrap your arms around their thighs and pull back. Pull their thighs into a deep hug -- this causes them to lose balance easily. \n Drive with your legs to bring them down. Once you've got your head in place and your arms wrapped, you want to push with your legs to bring them down. \n A ruck is your regular chance to keep or steal possession, and a good rucker is an invaluable asset on the team. If you see a teammate go down with the ball and you're nearby, try and be the first one in the ruck. Set one foot over the ball so that it is underneath you, then lean down into a low athletic position. When you've made contact with someone, win rucks using strength and leverage: \n Get underneath the opponent and push up and out. If you can get your shoulders or head under their chest, you can push them up to throw them off balance, then back to remove them from the ruck. \n Push teammates from behind to win contested rucks. If it looks like your team needs a boost, push your ruck through like a minor-scrum. Remember, however, that committing more than 2-3 people to a ruck leaves a lot of holes in the defense if you lose. \n Keep your feet moving through the ruck. To really crush rucks, chop your feet and push forward with every step. Imagine running straight through the player to the other side. This is called "clearing" a ruck, and it opens up a lot of space. If you're on defense and you can clear a ruck, even if you can't win the ball immediately, you'll throw the other team into disarray., Rugby is not an individually dominated sport. Even the best player will be unable to do anything without the support of teammates, as there are very few times a solo athlete has space or time to make a play themselves. On both defense and offense you should be in the best possible place to support your teammates, no matter what: \n On defense, you need to be in a horizontal line with your teammates, sliding left and right to close up any holes the opponent might try to push through. Once a teammate makes a tackle, you should either jump in the ruck if it is open or winnable or slide to either side of the teammate to make sure the other team doesn't exploit the gap while he is down from the tackle\n On offense, you need to spread out, forcing the other team to cover many angles. When a teammate is running, make sure you are always behind them and they have 1-2 people in passing range. If they get tackled, they may try a quick pass to you as they go down, leaving you plenty of time to run., Rugby can be played in any large field, so long as it is relatively flat and evenly sized. The size of the field will largely depend upon how seriously you intend to play. If you wish to simply play the game with a few friends, a local park with any large field may be enough. However, if you wish to play a proper match, you will need a field with two uprights for the extra point. Contact your local Parks and Recreation department or a local rugby club to find out about proper fields in your area. \n As long as you can mark out try-zones for each team, any rectangular patch of grass should be fine. \n Though the dimensions are slightly different, an American football field can fill in for a rugby field in a pinch. \n There are three commonly played forms of rugby, where the biggest difference is in the number of players. Real games have 15, 10, or 7 players on each team, but you can play with as many players as you want if you're just with friends. Each player should have: \n Athletic shoes, preferably with cleats in the bottom. \n Light, breathable clothing. \n Mouth guards and/or head protection, if desired. \n Water., Forwards are generally placed in position based on the scrum, and their positions does not necessarily impact where they will be during the rest of the game. What matters most is your scrum position: \n First row. The first row contains three players: the loose head prop and the tight head prop, who grip the hooker in between them.The role of the hooker is to gain possession of the ball during scrums and usually throw the ball in at line-outs. The role of the loose and tight head props is to support the hooker during scrums, support other players during line-outs and provide strength during rucks and mauls. The props are your two biggest players. \n Second row. The second row consists of two locks. These are the tallest players in the team and are generally used in line-outs to gain possession of the ball. They drive their shoulders into the props and are the engines of your scrums and rucks. \n Back row. The back row of forwards consists of three players: two flankers and the eight-man. They clasp onto the two sides and back and control the direction of the scrum, as well as the ball if it squeezes out. Generally these three are your fastest forwards, as they can quickly dart off the scrum when play restarts., Backs need to be good with their hands, and the best players need to be the first ones touching the ball. To visualize your back line, imagine the ball on the right side of the field. Each player will be 10-15 feet diagonally to the left of the other, starting with the scrum-half: \n Scrum-half: They start the ball from a ruck or scrum, pulling it out and determining the first player to get the ball. They must be light, small, and have considerable endurance to reach every ruck or scrum first. Most importantly, they need to see the whole field and distribute the ball accordingly. \n Fly-half: The quarterback for the backs. They run most of the kicking and run plays, like skipping a pass or fake passes, to try and break down the opponent's defense. \n Centers: There are two of them, and they are good overall players who can tackle well on defense, run and pass well in the middle, and kick if need be. They get the ball often and challenge the opponent's back line. \n Wings: Two wings that stay on each side-line, these are usually the fastest players. Your goal is to get them the ball on the outside, where they can hopefully outrun the opponents wing for massive gains. \n Fullback: She/he sits 15 meters or so behind the line, ready to get an opponent's kick, make a last-second tackle, or sprint forward to unexpectedly join the offense and overload a team. Must be versatile, able to kick and catch, and fast., There are several ways in which a penalty may be earned, and it is impossible to play the game and keep an eye out for every infraction. Minor infractions will likely result in a scrum being awarded to the other team. Others may cause a referee to take more serious action, giving a penalty kick, a "back ten" (when the team gets 10 meters to run the ball for free), or removing a player for some time. \n Common offenses include incorrect tackling, collapsing a scrum or ruck by leaving your feet, holding the ball when on the ground, and entering rucks incorrectly. \n The team awarded the penalty has several options. They can take a kick or punt, which will allow them to gain field position. They can take a penalty kick at the uprights for a chance at 3 points, or they can take a scrum, all in the location of the penalty. \n A game of rugby is physically intense, and you're incredibly prone to injury if you don't prepare. A good warm-up increases blood flow and prepares your muscles for the beating to come. A good, simple warm up to start with would include:10-minute light jog. Running is an excellent way to warm up for rigorous physical activity. Begin by walking briskly for 5 minutes, followed by 10 minutes of light jogging to prepare yourself for running. Dynamic stretching. Run with high knees, kick your ankle with your heel with each step, do some lunges, jump in place, swing your arms, and skip. These exaggerated, mobile stretches loosen your muscles more effectively than static stretching. \n Warm up rugby skills. Pass with a partner, take some kicks, and do some light rucking. Get used to rugby specific actions, even tackling at half-speed. Your forwards should do some practice scrums and lineouts, and your backs should get used to passing in a line. \n Drink water and eat at least 2 hours before playing. Hydration is essential in physical activity. In order to combat the loss of and increased use of water during exercise, it is important to stay well hydrated throughout the day but especially right before activity. The other essential nutrients used and expelled by your body during exercise are salt and potassium, eating lean meats, fruits, vegetables, and sports drinks/food., This is traditionally started by a coin toss, in order to determine which team will have first possession of the ball. You can toss coins or decide who starts in some other manner. Positioned at the center of the field, the team which has first possession will then kick the ball towards the opposition. \n Most rules state that this must be a drop-kick. It needs to go 10-meters before the ball can be played. \n If you are on the kicking team, you cannot pass the kicker until the ball has left his foot. \n After your team scores a try, the other team must kick it off to you again.
 \n This can be done by shutting off the main gas or turning off the circuit breaker for electrical devices.\n \n This procedure will prevent cold water from flowing into the water heater and prevent hot water from coming out during the cleaning process. \n The water valves consist of a cold water valve that may be colored blue, a hot water valve that may be colored red, and a third main valve that runs the water into your home. \n \n The purge valves have small handles that resemble the letter "T." \n This procedure is done to relieve any pressure that has built inside the valves and will prevent excess hot water from shooting out and coming into contact with your skin. \n There may be pressure when removing the purge port valve caps, so it is extremely important to make sure the hot water valve is completely and accurately shut off for safety purposes. \n Handle each cap carefully to make sure the rubber washer sealing discs stay in place, which are needed for your valves to function properly. \n \n If the manufacturer of your tankless water heater did not provide you with hosing lines, you can purchase them from any retail store specializing in home repair or water heaters. The hosing lines must be long enough to reach between the water heater and your bucket. \n You may need to consult your manual provided by the tankless water heater's manufacturer or contact the manufacturer directly for exact instructions regarding this procedure. \n In some cases, this procedure may require you to use a sump pump and connect hoses that will discharge and flush water from the tankless water heater using the cold and hot water valves. \n \n Since your tankless water heater is most likely the source of all your drinking water and bathing water, using chemical cleaning solutions may be extremely harmful to your health. \n \n This procedure may take up to 45 minutes. \n \n Tighten the caps completely and firmly without breaking the rubber sealing discs located inside the caps. \n \n This procedure may just require you to rotate and open the cold and hot water valves so they are parallel to the position of the main valve that leads into the house. \n \n Continue to run the water until it runs steadily without air escaping. \n This procedure may take up to 2 or 3 minutes. \n

If you are paying over the phone, you will need a credit card. \n 
 Make a "C" with your Index finger, Middle finger, and thumb. Have your ring and pinky fingers right beside them curled upon the holes. Then throw. If done right, the ball may move sideways up to 4 feet (1.2 m).\n Make the holes face right. Put your middle finger on the ball so it covers three of the holes. Put your index finger next to the holes, but separated from your middle finger. Throw 3/4 submarine and snap your wrist. Throw it outside at the batter's knees for a right handed batter and it should curve up and in the strike zone. \n Hold the ball with the holes to the left. Place your index and middle finger right next to the holes almost touching. Then throw it full submarine so your knuckles almost touch the ground. \n Hold the ball so the holes are to the right and cover the holes with your index and middle finger and throw it over hand. Opposite for righties. \n Most effective for left-handers. Grip the ball like a normal screwball and do the same arm motion except when you release the ball come through it as if your throwing a curve ball, giving it a big loop like a nasty curve ball. \n Hold the ball like you would a riser, but throw overhand, and flick your wrist as you come around. The ball should make the motion of a screwball then suddenly drop.(This pitch is awesome to use on a 2and 2 pitch. Even though you might not get a strike if you do it perfectly it will be nasty.) After throwing this about 20 times your arm may hurt, so take a break. \n Then throw 3/4 submarine and the ball should break up and to the right. \n Make a "C' with your index finger, middle finger, and thumb. If you're a right handed pitcher then the holes should be on the right. If you're a left handed pitcher then the holes should be on the left. Make sure that your hands don't cover the holes. \n Hold the ball with the holes on the left side and stick your index finger into one hole. Allow your index finger to be the last finger on the ball and the ball should curve 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) to the left. This takes some practice. \n The holes should be on the right side. Put your middle finger into one of the holes then put your index finger on the opposite side of the hole. To make this work you should throw this in the middle of sidearm and normal. \n Same as a curve ball just with the holes facing the right. Well almost the same, you want to have your fingers on the holes this time and have your fingers pointing towards the middle of the ball more so its not parallel with the holes like the curve. Pretty much like and "X" with your 2 fingers and the holes. Hold this also with your index and middle fingers. \n Hint: You want to throw this to the left side of the strike zone and flick your wrist a lot, hold it loose and almost lob it. As long as you have enough flick with your wrist it will slide or screw very smoothly to the right. \n Put the holes so they are facing to the right now put your index and middle finger along the holes while your thumb is underneath and throw it over hand. make sure you aim low and behind the batter because it will break a lot. \n Put the holes facing to the left(right hander) and make a "c" with your index finger and thumb. Put your middle finger on the words "wiffle ball" on the solid part of the ball. Throw at 3/4 arm slot. If thrown right it will break all the way from a right handed batter across the zone. \n Throw overhand. It should curve about 3 feet (0.9 m) to the right. \n the index finger covers the holes for a lefty, and the pointer finger for a right hander. flick your three fingers and it should move a lot while appearing to shake. \n Hold the ball so the holes are facing down and throw the ball 3/4. you must also throw the ball down a little bit. \n Hold the ball like you would a dropper, except do your full wind up and throw between a submarine and sidearm, and when thrown flick your index and middle finger, when done properly the ball will do the motion of a riser then break like a slider. \n For righties, put the holes facing the left. For lefties, put the holes facing the right. Stick your pointer finger in one hole. Throw overhand. \n Hold a screwball grip and throw 3/4 submarine and should drop and move like a curve ball. \n Position your hand so that the holes are on the right side of the ball (for Righty Pitchers) and left side for Lefty Pitchers. Make your pointer and middle fingers into a "V" and push the ball up between them so it is kind of stuck. Throw the ball at any arm degree. However, between sidearm and 3/4 arm is the best. The ball should curve away to a righty if thrown over the top, up and away if thrown 3/4, it will sink if thrown sidearm and will curve in if thrown submarine. \n Hold the wiffle ball with the holes out to the left and your index and middle finger vertical and on the right of the holes. Try to have your fingers on the holes. It's kind of like your giving someone the "loser" sign on your forehead but with 2 fingers. \n Hint: Try to aim at a batter who's right handed, it will curve all the way across the plate. Sometimes even around their head and still hit the strike zone. \n Hold the ball with the holes facing to the right, split your fingers, snap your wrist, and throw sidearm/submarine.( This pitch takes practice, but it helps to learn a riser first and then try snapping your wrist.) This is J.Wayne's pitch. \n Scuff up you wiffle ball and grip it like a curve. Then throw it straight it should either curve like a gyro, curve, or slider. \n With the holes to the left put your index finger in one of the holes. Put your finger in the hole about 3/4 of the way up your nail. have your middle finger spread about half an inch apart. throw the ball 3/4 arm, or overhand. \n Holes facing up put your index and middle fingers on the holes on the right of the ball. your thumb should be on the seam on the left of the ball. throw 3/4 or sidearm and it should curve about a foot and dive about 1 or 2 feet (0.3 or 0.6 m). \n Holes facing down, get your fingernails on each piece of plastic in between the holes. Get on top; and push rather than toss. \n Put your index and middle finger on the opposite side of where the holes are throw so you turn the ball over to the side with the holes and should drop straight down. \n Have the holes facing the right for righties left for lefties split your fingers and have the middle finger be on the side of the holes have your index finger on the middle of he ball ( finger should be on the left side of the ball) throw side arm and snap your wrist up if thrown right ball will rise and at the last second curve \n Push in the hole side so that it is half a ball. Put the dent to the left. Put your middle finger on the center of the ball and your ring finger right next to it. Leave your pinkie and pointer fingers off of the ball. Throw way to the right of the batter. It's nasty. \n Put the holes on the left side. Put your middle and ring fingers right on the half mark of the ball put your thumb at the bottom and throw it at the batter just watch the "Humongous Curve". \n Holes on bottom put middle and index finger on top of ball where the trademark thing is. put thumb on side of holes then twist your wrist it will drop 4 feet (1.2 m). \n Hold the ball like you would hold a curve ball, but as you release, flick your wrist. \n Hold the the ball with the holes facing away from you and just throw like a fastball. It should curve about 5 feet (1.5 m) to the left. \n Make a "c" with pointer middle and thumb. middle finger and thumb should be on the middle of the ball with holes to the right if you are a right-handed pitcher. Pinky and ring finger should be curled up in the small circle where the pat # is (they should not be on the holes). This pitch should be thrown as a sidearm pitch, but the lower the release point the better it is. Just before the release point you should snap your wrist to get maximum rise. \n Hold this pitch the same as a curve ball but just throw it side arm and flick your wrist a lot! You want the holes to be straight up and just let the ball hover right across the plate. It usually stays right where you want to throw it unless you angle your arm awkwardly. \n Hold with the holes facing down and have your index and middle finger over the holes and your thumb on the opposite side of the ball. When you throw you want to bend down to throw, throw across your body. \n Push in the side with holes. put them on the bottom. Throw sidearm and flick your wrist. \n The middle finger goes into a hole while the other stays gripped normally. Deliver like a riser but don't throw it as hard and flick your wrist. It will float across the plate. Make sure to never throw it twice in a row. \n This pitch is the same as the riser just with the holes facing down. For some people the riser and floater are vice versa. With this pitch you also need to have a lot of flick with your wrist in order for it to work. \n Hold the ball like a circle change up, and then throw the ball submarine style. Snap your wrist. This pitch is a counter to the sidearm Rise-ball. To fool the hitter as he/she sees you pitch sidearm, they are expecting it to rise when all of a sudden it sinks. Hold just like the Rise-ball except turn the holes toward the index finger. (If held out if front of the face the holes should be pointed to the left, opposite for a lefty). Throw this pitch sidearm again. aim high and to the right a little it will sink down and away from a right handed batter. Throw harder for more break. \n Hold the ball as you would for a so-called "screwball" so that the holes are to the right of your middle and index fingers (which should be together). Keeping this grip, throw it sidearm w/ a strong snap of the wrist, this will cause it to rise slightly then drop dramatically, just like a splitter. \n Have the holes of the ball on the left side and put your index finger on the left side of holes or barely on the holes, then do the same with the right middle finger but except on the right side of the holes. \n Hint: If you throw overhand snap your wrists down a little and it should drop a couple of feet. \n Hold the ball on your finger tips on the bottom of the ball. Throw underhand, but exaggeratedly high, and flick your wrist upwards, with as much force as a fastball. It should rise and rise, and the batter will stop to look at it, and it should drop into the zone. \n Put your middle finger in the holes so that they are on the right. Put your thumb on the bottom of the ball. Place your index finger to the left of your middle finger so they are spread apart, but not too far. Throw between 3/4 and over the top but twist your hand so the holes are in the front while pitching. The ball should drop 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m). \n Hold like a screwball, except split your fingers.throw sidearm and flick your wrist. \n Put pointer finger halfway on the holes and middle finger touching your pointer finger, throw sidearm at an up angle, for example throw sidearm but throw at the top of the strike zone and it will drop about 6 feet (1.8 m) if thrown hard enough. it will drop right into the strike zone and strike the opponent out! \n Hold the ball like a fastball but split your hands just less than you would for a splitter. you should almost have a slice motion to your throw so that is a 3 quarter throw. the pitch takes practice but it should cut a foot but it looks like it will cut 5! \n Put your index finger on the equator with the holes on the left for righties then have your middle finger an inch to an inch and a half then put your thumb just barely on top of the holes close to the middle then throw it at 3 quarters and it should cut straight across the strike zone. \n Holes on left of the ball put index finger over the middle of the holes, put middle finger on the seam. thumb also on the middle of holes but on bottom of the ball. pitch over the top it should break 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) away from a righty batter and will drop about 6 to 9 inches (15.2 to 22.9 cm). \n Have the holes facing you, put your index and middle fingers on the top of the ball and slightly on the holes. Instead of holding it with your fingers hold it with your index and middle knuckles. Your other fingers will tuck in on the side of the ball regularly, not with your knuckles. Also don't let your ring and pinky wrap around the ball just tuck them in with your hand. \n The original knuckle ball is pretty good, but this one is nasty! Push the center of the ball (center being circle in between the holes) and bend your pinky and ring fingers. Place them in the dent you created. Put your pointer and pinky fingers out over side of ball. As you throw it, flick out your bent fingers, it is uncontrollable but moves like crazy! \n Hint: Good luck throwing this one (and hitting it) \n Hint: Your hold on the ball should be almost the same as the devil's horns sign. \n Have the holes facing the right. Put middle finger slightly in one of the holes put index finger to the left of the middle finger, put thumb on the bottom of the ball, throw over hand and snap wrist down hard. ball should drop if thrown right about 4 feet (1.2 m). \n Put your fingers on the side with no holes put your index, middle, and ring knuckles on the ball.Throw towards the ground and snap your wrist. It floats like crazy! \n Put the holes on the bottom with your index, middle, ring, and pinky knuckles right above the median with your thumb on the center of the side with the holes. The batter will think the pitch will move, making him uncomfortable. \n Hold a normal Knuckleball (on the very inner edges/near the middle of the ball), but, put index and middle inside top two holes, the thumb, ring and pinky on the bottom 3 (should have at least 3 holes open, two on the left and 1 on the right for righties and vice versa for southpaws) and throw as hard and push the ball with the fingers. If successful, the ball should have little-to-no curve and have plenty of speed and drop to it! (play MLB Power Pros for PS2 or Wii and play until you have the Psychic Goggles or face Alvin in the College Kings World Series, where he has the similar, but, more powerful Star Shaker pitch, which acts like a Mirage Knuckle, only moves faster and is harder to hit/watch MLB Power Pros Success Mode videos to see how the Mirage Knuckle* works. \n Note: The Mirage Knuckle is officially known as the Mirage Knuckler! Just be aware when Alvin uses it! \n Hold the ball with the holes facing which ever way you want. Stick your index finger in one of the holes. Not too far in the hole so it is completely stuck. Throw this pitch hard and let your finger come out when you release. It should be off speed. Slow, but should reach the plate after the batter swings. \n Hold the ball with all 5 fingers evenly spaced. Throw like a fastball, except step forward an extra 5–10 inches (12.7–25.4 cm). It should appear as a sinker- except stay at the same height. \n When this one works it's sick. Hold the ball like you re making an "okay" sign with your hand. So your index and thumb are making a circle and your other fingers are away. Make the circle around the holes of the ball. It tends to curve to the left but it works. \n Face holes toward you and then put hour palm on the part with holes throw like a fastball it will be a little off-speed but don't throw it right over the plate throw it outside. \n Hold like a slider, but with three fingers. Throw sidearm and flick your wrist. \n Hold it with the holes to the left then hold like curve. Flick wrist like screwball. The ball will rise up to the left about 8 inches (20.3 cm) then have a 12 6 curving action to the right with a drop of about 4 feet (1.2 m). It is a deadly weapon invented by pro wiffle baller Jason Fargrovin from South Korea. \n Have the holes facing you and put the tips of your index, middle, and ring finger on the top three holes. Have your thumb and pinky on the bottom and almost cover the rest of the holes with your palm. Throw like a fastball put spin the ball by flicking your wrist left our right. It will look like a fastball but break a little bit and slow down. \n Hold the ball like you would a riser (holes down deliver sidearm). During delivery cut under the ball so it spins like a football with the holes forward. When successfully thrown it should rise and slow down in the middle of the pitch. \n Hold the ball with holes up, put mid finger on a space in between the holes and pointer finger on a hole throw overhand. \n Hold the ball with holes facing towards the batter and throw overhand spinning the ball as you throw. \n Hold the ball as you would a fastball and lob it so it just makes it a strike. Only throw when ahead in the count e.g. 0-1 0-2 1-2 or maybe a 1-1 or 2-2 but not anything else. And if they don't swing it's usually a ball. \n Put your pointer and your middle together and others below so holes are on the left side throw lightly it should curve way over to the left. \n Make a C with your thumb, and your middle/index fingers. Hold the ball so your fingers are on opposite sides of the ball. When throwing this pitch, throw it completely over the top and grip the ball very loosely. When you release the ball it's like you are almost not holding on to it. Exaggerate your follow through, (making sure you actually delivered the ball), and it should drop about 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m). \n Hold the ball between your thumb and palm with your fingers up. Experiment with how the holes go or how many fingers are up! \n This pitch moves a little but is hard to hit. With the holes all facing down, hold your index and middle fingers above the holes parallel to them. Throw sidearm. \n Hold the ball with the holes on the top. Put your index finger in the middle hole, and throw straight forward and down, and when you are about to release, flick your index finger down. It should break 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m). \n Hold almost like a slider but put thumb a little more up almost toward the trademark thing. Throw almost sidearm and it will do almost anything so it will always fool the batter. Best if used with 2 strikes. \n For righties, have the ball set as a screwball or slider, another way for lefties. Place your fingers like a riser, but your middle and index fingers curled up like a knuckle ball. Push off those 2 fingers and it should not move but it will curve. \n This pitch is very difficult to grip. The holes are facing to the right and your ring and pinkie fingers are bent like you were throwing a knuckle ball. Place your ring and pinkie finger going diagonally up the holes. When pitching to a right-handed batter, aim at him and when throwing, flick your wrist clockwise., Grip the pitch like you would a slider, but throw it like you would a riser. If thrown effectively, it will 'sweep' across the zone. This is useful for pitchers throwing to an opposite hand batter as it is an opposite curve.

, The first example shown above will return an error if the active cell is in columns A through D, since moving four columns to the left would take the active cell to an invalid cell address. \n Note also that the Union method does not work across sheets. For example, this line works fine \n Set y = Application.Union(Range("Sheet1!A1:B2"), Range("Sheet1!C3:D4")) \n but this line \n Set y = Application.Union(Range("Sheet1!A1:B2"), Range("Sheet2!C3:D4")) \n returns the error message: \n Union method of application class failed \n Each example states the range of cells in the sample data that would be selected., _ End(xlDown).Address).Select \n When this code is used with the sample table, cells A1 through A4 will be selected. \n _ End(xlUp).Address).Select \n When this code is used with the sample table, it will select cells A1 through A6. \n The range selected by the CurrentRegion method is an area bounded by any combination of blank rows and blank columns. The following is an example of how to use the CurrentRegion method: \n ActiveSheet.Range("a1").CurrentRegion.Select \n This code will select cells A1 through C4. Other examples to select the same range of cells are listed below: \n ActiveSheet.Range("A1", _ #*ActiveSheet.Range("A1").End(xlDown).End(xlToRight)).Select or \n ActiveSheet.Range("A1:" & _ ActiveSheet.Range("a1").End(xlDown).End(xlToRight).Address).Select \n In some instances, you may want to select cells A1 through C6. In this example, the CurrentRegion method will not work because of the blank line on Row 5. The following examples will select all of the cells: \n lastCol = ActiveSheet.Range("A1").End(xlToRight).Column lastRow = ActiveSheet.Cells(65536, lastCol).End(xlUp).Row ActiveSheet.Range("A1", ActiveSheet.Cells(lastRow, lastCol)).Select or \n lastCol = ActiveSheet.Range("a1").End(xlToRight).Column lastRow = ActiveSheet.Cells(65536, lastCol).End(xlUp).Row ActiveSheet.Range("a1:" & _ ActiveSheet.Cells(lastRow, lastCol).Address).Select \n \n Herewith is an image of a non-contiguous selection in Excel. \n \n To select, you would type aCell.

 \n Set Preferences: In General - Set Use R1C1 reference style to checked or On. \n Set column 1 to Format Column Width .5" and Format Row Height .25" \n Select Rows 2:200 and set Format Row Height to .06" (but see Tips). \n Select Columns 2:512 and set Format Column Width to .03" (but see Tips). \n Read through these steps and tips entirely before actually setting to work -- there's a time-consuming route (given first) and an easier way (via making a copy of the given macro) that will save a lot of time and effort! But to create your own tartan's pattern, you must be familiar with the concepts conveyed in the first part, starting with this next step:\n Be exact as you possibly can be, it's important in achieving the exact effect of really replicating the tartan, precisely. Here's a picture of a tartan closeup which had its threads counted. \n Select the column. Make the color match the tartan's beginning thread color. Use the Color Wheel. Format Cells Fill the column (or to a designated row# stopping point) with the color., Use the Color Wheel. Format Cells Fill the row (or to a designated column# stopping point) with the color., continuing over and under this way until you've filled the screen with the full image of the tartan! Be patient with yourself and do the job right, although it may take you hours, or even days to finish. Working with the macros, however, takes much less time in the end., Then, whether you used the Grab app, or Paste Picture, do Command+v, copy., Well worth it, eh?, You use Advanced Editing to copy All the code to Word and do a Replace All of "#* " with nothing, and the code will result, which you can then paste into over a Visual Basic dummy macro you recorded that was meaningless. Read on first, however. \n Note: In Sub Macro2(), at the end, there are some Directory path names in code lines which need to be changed to match your computer, please. You can find out what these are by recording a macro to save a file into the folder where you plan to save the tartan work and tartan macro. \n It is suggested that you make a text copy of any modifications you make to the macro and store them in a Word file to the same folder, for example if you modify the code to make a different tartan than the Anderson tartan. \n Remember, you can always broaden the columns and row heights to get a better look at what's what in terms of thread count relative to the vertical looping down the rows in Sub Macro3(). \n Then Developer will appear on your Ribbon and when you click on it, you'll see the Record icon button., Macro1 say, before its end, perhaps overwriting the dummy recorded code, type in Macro2. That will call this Macro2 below, which you've copied in and pasted below Macro1. You therefore can RUN either Macro2 or Macro1 and accomplish the same effect -- completion of the tartan!  :D, The macro can take anywhere from 3.5 minutes to a half hour or more to run, depending on your processor (speed). The code could have been written to run quicker but it would have been less easy to understand. The line numbers are there to break up the code between different colors; a long section of code actually goes from what would be Line 841 to Line 870, typically. There are shorter sections where there were only single or double threads (otherwise, looping was used, so the max loop value for the last X03 of 5 means that there are 5+2 = 7 rows or threads in the last weft section of black. It is black because of Macro3 leaving the top cell of the 7 black. The first two rows have every other cell pasted from this origin cell; after that, the entire done rows are copied and pasted below per the X03 loop, which is much quicker. They are only done singly, however, as multiples would get confusing, given that the tartan is very inconsistent in how many threads per weft section there are, actually. That said, the macro is so very much faster than doing it manually, there is just No Comparison!! \n
