because for the same reason you can't ban free speech. It's a constitutional right that was intentionally made hard to dismantle.
During this period, the new employee has no access to the company’s benefits, such as sick and vacation pay, retirement plan contributions, or other perks. So it’s not so much that the company has a way out in case the employee isn’t up to par, but that the company can save money on the employee by not providing the full benefits package until the employee has “proved” themselves.
To some extent, they’re synonyms. “Illegal” is more often used to refer to an action that constitutes a crime, a violation of the law which can subject a person to criminal prosecution, a criminal record, and, possibly, a prison sentence. “Unlawful” is more often used to refer to an action that constitutes a violation of any law, even though the violation cannot be construed as criminal. Some common examples of an unlawful but noncriminal action might be something like a breach of contract with a landlord or a failure to pay a fine when it’s due, or a failure to register to vote. If the government itself is ignoring a law or regulation, it’s more likely to be called unlawful than illegal.
Brittany Spears is a pop star who was famous in the early 21st century. She grew up as a child entertainer and was a high-profile star. Then, starting from the second half of the 21st century, she began to behave erratically, such as her suspicious marriage and her scandalous mental breakdown. Consequently, her parents managed to get a court order that basically removed her will. In the legal procedure, she had the right to choose where to live, when to live, whether to work, and where to spend money, so she was basically deprived of most of her freedom of choice. In a sense, she is a slave to her guardians. But it was very famous that he began to litigate in public, removing this legal barrier, and basically making him a normal person again.
If you want to prove a horse exists, then go find one. But how do you prove there are no unicorns? You can go and search everywhere and still not find one. That would be the end of the search. There will always be the possibility that they are there.
If you have committed several offenses, each with a life sentence, then multiple life sentences are a symbolic way to "balance" the victims; you are punished for every crime.
that only works if the people you are snitching to are all good and their punishments are fair. The system of repression is still rife with power abuse and systemic racism. And a lot of crime is the direct result of people being forced to live in oppressive systems. Many gangs were originally formed to protect communities that were being brutalized or ignored by law enforcement. A lot of drug dealers say they got into dealing because they wanted money to buy nice things for themselves and their families. In the U.S., the prison population is predominantly Black, indigenous, and poor, which means they have already been oppressed a lot. They probably didn’t have proper representation because public defenders are criminally underfunded. They are used for free or cheap labor (watch 13th by Ava Duvernay) and leave in debt with a criminal record that can get you disqualified from certain jobs and housing and be flagged on background checks for others. So for a lot of incarcerated people, snitching won’t get you anywhere. It will help your oppressors and hand another person over to the system. Even if you despise the “bad guy,” you might not want to see him fucked over by your greater enemy. Also, there is a long history of “prison informants” who lied. Sometimes they just tell whatever they think will get them a better deal (usually time off their own sentences). Sometimes the cops will deliberately house a snitch with someone awaiting trial to get a “confession.”
“Escrow Agent:" “An escrow agent executed a series of financial operations for a company.” Execution: "(a) To carry out the sentence of death against a legally condemned criminal." Quickly typing on Google Translate: “Executed: convicted of treason, sentenced to death."
I live in a pretty small town in the middle of the country, and I have done some public relations work for the police here. They like to joke that the only time they have to report shots fired is when a deer gets shot and they use a shotgun to put it out of its misery. I'm sure the rate is higher in big cities, but in smaller towns it's practically zero.
The person is not in court because he is guilty of a crime, he is in court because he has been accused of a crime.
- it's an experience of a loss of self, mostly in the course of psychedelic experiences, but sometimes also in the course of deep meditation. The ego is the same as the three sacramental triad of Freud: id, ego, super ego. The ego is the self, self-esteem, self-decision, self-knowledge, self-experience, superego is the conscience, it's the conscience, morality, guilt, anxiety. And so, ego death is the detachment from reality and self.
It depends, but the fact is that a federal employee is not subject to prosecution in state court while performing official duties for the federal government. It’s not the state law itself that is being struck down, but rather the prosecution of the state law. This case has been covered by others, so let me refer you to that one.
There are a number of goals, in fact: Deterrence; Rehabilitation; Restoration of order; Punishment; Control of behavior; etc. According to the prevailing culture of a given government and nation, one or more of these can be emphasized above the others. In the United States, for example, starting in the seventies and reaching its peak in the nineties, there was a cultural and political shift away from rehabilitation toward punishment. In essence, many people were asking the same question as you: if rehabilitation was not working, then let’s just punish people. The emphasis now is not so much on deterrence or on preventing recidivism—of people going back to crime after being released from prison—as it is on punishing them.
The prosecutor did a lousy job, and there was also a video showing him running away from the victims while they chased him and beat him up.
When in 1873 the Supreme Court ruled in Taylor v. Taintor that the practice of bounty hunting is a branch of law enforcement. In the United States, a bounty hunter (or bail bondsman) is a person who tracks down and hunts down someone who has not appeared in court after posting bail, and the reward for doing so is generally a percentage of the bail amount. So "dead or alive" was no longer allowed, since a trial hadn't yet been held and so the bounties had no official legal status.
I don’t think it’s that simple. When you’re five years old and your siblings accuse you of stealing a cookie from the cookie jar, your babysitter says she’ll take a little money from you as a punishment, but promises not to make a big deal out of it. So you confess. Then your father comes home, hears from the babysitter, and sends you to your room for three to ten years. Three years later your mother decides that’s not fair, that the only reason you confessed was because you were promised you’d get away with it, and she lets you out of the house. In this scenario, you are Cosby. Your babysitter is the prosecutor in a sexual assault case who promised to shield Cosby from criminal prosecution if he would agree to give evidence in a civil case. Your father is the lower court that threw Cosby in jail. And your mother is the PA Supreme Court. Equals a cookie = equals sexual assault. Three to ten years = three to ten years.
“Sanctions are economic measures that a country imposes on its own economy in order to compel a country to stop doing X if the imposing country considers X to be detrimental to its own national interests. Normally it consists of the prohibition of certain trade, business, or industry. An example is the following: “We do not sell any weaponry technology to North Korea, and whoever does that, will be punished.” Sanctions are not rare. While they are often the last resort of a country that is short of manpower and material before war, economic sanctions are often used by influential countries on other countries to stop human rights abuses or certain countries acquiring the economic power or technical knowledge that could destabilize the whole region. In many cases sanctions are not successful, but in some cases it forces a country to stop their aggressive actions or at least back down.” In many cases the country (call it A) that is imposing sanctions would not interfere with trade between country B and country C. The problem is that the world economy is connected, and many financial systems and transactions are done through US banking and payment systems. In consequence the US has some influence to impose sanctions even on transactions that do not involve its economy directly. Regarding Russia: Currently Russia is threatening to invade Ukraine, and it is involved in the annexation of Crimea and the downing of flight MH17. Therefor both the EU and the US have imposed sanctions of various intensities on Russia, as the EU in particular would not like to have a war starting on its eastern border. It did not help that Russia has attempted to assassinate several people in Europe with the help of poison gas and radioactive material.
All male U.S. citizens and residents age 18-25 are registered for the Selective Service System in the event that the government must select people for military service from the general population. This is just notification of your registration; if the information they have on you is incorrect, you can have it changed.
Because the law says so. Why is it not murder to kill an unarmed man who is chasing you after throwing a plastic bag at you while you’re pointing a gun at him? A: Because that’s what the law says. Generally, if you’re in a reasonable and imminent fear of death or serious bodily harm by the unlawful actions of another person, you are permitted to use deadly force to defend yourself (this varies according to the wording of the state’s laws). No matter if they don’t have a gun, they can still hurt you, kill you. And you don’t have to get into a fight first.
The American Constitution protects a right to a fair trial and a legal defense. Your legal defense is to make sure that the trial is fair and that the search warrants are valid. Even if the accused is guilty, this does not change anything. There is a long history of corrupt police departments and prosecutors forging evidence, beating confessions out of people and executing illegal search warrants. You can’t just assume that “good people” are good people.
There are a number of reasons. What if five years after the trial, some new evidence demonstrates their innocence?
There are many medicines used today whose mechanism of action isn't fully understood. You probably have Tylenol in your medicine cabinet—it doesn't work the way we think it does either.
The criminal standard of proof is higher than that of a civil case. In the criminal case, guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas in the civil case, guilt is proven by a preponderance of evidence.
They might think that they’ve got to get rid of it quickly, and that spending a half hour taking it apart completely and then a half hour driving to a country stream and chucking it in seems to carry with it too much risk of being caught. Also, it may be that most do it that way and you only see the fools on the news.
Because they are unreliable. Everything from strong emotions to faulty equipment can lead to completely distorted readings. Then you have the problem that the result is “interpreted” by someone, and it’s also possible to fool it.
For one thing, a lack of extradition treaties does not mean a country cannot hand over a foreign criminal to the country of his origin. In other words, if you try to flee to Andorra, Andorra can still say, “Hey, no, back to the US.” The extradition treaty is a treaty of legal necessity, which obliges a country to hand over a foreign criminal, if it can, and in some cases, under defined conditions. And there are many reasons why a country does not want to be forced to hand over a foreign criminal and wants to keep that right.
Well, they can technically do whatever they feel like. But there have been instances where judges have overruled a verdict of guilty because they felt the prosecutor had not proven his case beyond a reasonable doubt. But this cannot be done when the judge feels the opposite—that the prosecutor did prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt, but the jury found no guilt. I live in Australia. There have been cases where judges have ordered a jury to find the defendant not guilty.
fair use is part of the Berne Convention on copyright. It says that if you use someone's work for educational purposes (but you have to deal with that work) or satire, it's ok. So if you make a lesson on pop music (even a music video lesson) you can use a song. But you can't use it for an unrelated lesson. And the satire part is basically the only reason South Park is allowed to depict minnie mouse having sex with a bat.
You are correct. If you have ever heard that stealing is legal, you are either talking out of your a** about something that isn't actually illegal, or you are badly misinformed and are just repeating the words of people who are. It is Walgreen's, and it is Walgreen's alone, that has to enforce the law. It is not Walgreen's place to enforce the law. That is the police's job. Walgreen's can not arrest you for stealing. There is some gray area here. They do have the right to defend their property, so if they catch you stealing, they can hold you until the police get there, but the police have to get involved. Thus, it comes down to business, not legality. Walgreen's is a multibillion dollar company. They could lose fifty bucks worth of miscellaneous items from a single store and probably not lose a thing. It would not be surprising if Walgreen's gave instructions to its employees, such as, “If you see someone stealing, call the police and describe them, but don't get involved” because they would rather lose the merchandise than have an employee get hurt or even killed, trying to be a hero. It is not surprising if this is how they operate. Banks have the same policy. Go into any bank in the U.S. and tell them you're there to rob it, and they'll probably open the cash register and let you take all the money out. You may be getting busted by the police or the FBI a few minutes later, but the bank isn't really responsible for that. They have insurance and would rather lose the merchandise than have an employee or customer get hurt or killed.
I haven't any of the details or facts, but I'm also aware of the possibility of people withholding evidence or similar things that may not reflect well on them. The most damaging facts against Heard only came out after the judge's ruling. This meant that the initial ruling was based on flawed and incomplete data.
The duty of a juror is to determine whether the defendant has broken the law. Jury nullification is the deliberate decision to disregard whether the law has been broken, and instead, to acquit because the juror disagrees with the law in principle. For example, if I don’t support the war on drugs, I may refuse to vote guilty on a charge of possession of illegal substances, even if I have the best of evidence that the defendant was guilty of it. The issue is highly controversial, because it is the duty of Congress, and indirectly, the voters, to determine whether laws are unjust or not, and not twelve random jurors. It has been used in the past for some good, and for much harm. But since jurors are not required to give any explanation of their votes, there is little to stop them, unless they confess.
No, stem cell research is neither illegal nor controversial. What is illegal is stem cell research on embryonic stem cells. That is not controversial, at least not anymore, as embryonic stem cells are of very little practical use. They are hard to get to do anything except form a fetus, and they are rejected by the body as any other organ from a third party. So research now focuses on adult stem cells, which are taken from a person’s own fat, skin or bone marrow, and they have a very good chance of working and are very well funded in the US.
Report the theft or fraud to the credit card company, it shouldn't be your problem. It's different in your country, but I have always been able to wipe all the card fraud I have ever experienced in America.
Why do people want to immigrate to the US, despite the racial discrimination, lack of health care, and higher cost of living? The usual cliche: the land of opportunity. The US has weak social security nets, but it also doesn't share its wealth as widely. If you're in a position in a skilled profession where you think you can make a lot of money, you'd want to do it in the US, where you'll probably not only earn more, but also keep more. * Think of a doctor. A family-doctor in Canada may make the same amount after taxes as a doctor in the US, but an orthopedic surgeon may make double. So if you could choose between a salary of $400,000 or $200,000, where would you want to live?
they can’t keep them deliberating forever. If the jury, after honest efforts, is at a deadlock, the judge may declare a mistrial, and the defendant will be retried with a new jury.
Lie detectors are not particularly reliable, that's why they are not allowed as evidence in court. And even if they were, it would only work if you have a small list of suspects. Otherwise you would have to test everyone in town.
In the United States, if the accused wants a trial by jury instead of a trial by judge, in which the judge makes all the decisions. It may also depend on the charges, as there is a special "small claims court" and "traffic court" in which the judge is always involved.
What happened there? It’s all taken away.
In my US state, the age of consent is 16. But I’m forty, and I remember how stupid I was at sixteen. Then we probably need to revise it. But the main thing is, that the girl is sixteen, not yet a young woman, but still a girl, and the man is twenty-five or thirty. It’s disgusting, no matter what age of consent.
The question is not whether it is alright but whether it would be a crime to punish them for it. There are several factors which have determined the age of consent. But a very important one is when we deem a person to be mature enough to make such a decision. In the United Kingdom, the age of consent is sixteen. So if two minors have sex, then the law is essentially saying that neither of them was mature enough to make an informed decision to do it. So it would be unfair to say at the same time that they did not know what they were doing and that they should be punished for it. For example if it were two fifteen year olds, then it would be alright. But if it were a fifteen year old and a ten year old, it would certainly be treated as an offence.
Your ISP has probably connected you to a source that has already been reported as an illegal movie-downloader. You were then tagged as a downloader. This is a bad way to police the Internet. How do they know that it was you who did the downloading? How do they know that it wasn't a virus that did the job? How do they know that it wasn't a visitor to your home who did the downloading? This is where I would say: B.S.
It came after a very dreadful shooting in a school in Dunblane, and public sentiment was definitely 'never again.' The public generally welcomed it. I recall there was some resistance from gun clubs, but this was seen as a relatively small obstacle to a law that was widely supported. I had that impression at the time; it may have been different in different parts of the country.
For the simple reason that murder is not the same as killing. For example, if someone comes in your house, attacks you with a knife, and you kill him to defend yourself, you haven’t committed murder, or any other crime, you did what was justified. War is an extension of this idea to the level of a nation. Soldiers kill other soldiers, but (theoretically) they’re defending the country. There are many theories about what justifies just a war, and what doesn’t, and sometimes the leaders of the country can be held accountable for the latter.
The USA is a federation, that is, it has states with a certain power, and the federal government with another power. Each state has two senators in the Senate and many representatives in the House of Representatives. Ted Cruz, as one of the two senators from the state of Texas, is responsible for the needs of his state in the federal government. In emergencies, he should ask for federal help: federal funds, federal troops, etc.
I don’t know about getting Chicken Pox twice, but after a person has had Chicken Pox, if the infection occurs again, it can cause shingles. It is usually a painful and itchy condition that occurs in old people or those with weak immune systems.
Pressing the issue. Write to your representatives, urge them to repeal the law. Speak out. Political pressure. Vote for a candidate who promises to try to repeal the law. Vote out those who refuse to try. If the law in question is alleged to be unconstitutional, as the Texas law is alleged to be, then one can break it and the case will be brought before the Supreme Court, which will rule on its constitutionality.
The choice is usually life in prison or death. At least a guilty plea saves your life. On death row, you run a fair chance of dying early, from state terrorism. Some people would rather live than die, even if it’s in prison. Especially if they are convinced they are innocent. Eventually they may succeed in overturning their conviction. But you can’t overturn a death sentence.
Innocent until proven guilty means a person is considered not guilty of a crime until it's proven that he is. In contrast, guilty until proven innocent means a person has to prove he's innocent before he's proven guilty. It's the same difference as between "guilty until proven innocent" and "guilty until proven innocent." In other words, I'm accusing you, Clear_Adhesion, of being a witch. Would you rather the law considered you innocent until I prove you guilty or guilty until you prove you're not? In a witch's trial, you might be burned alive, right? That's why we use the "innocent until proven guilty" rule. It's too expensive to assume someone is guilty!
US Marshals are the branch of the judicial branch of the judicial branch of the federal government responsible for: 1 – the security of the Federal District Courts and judges; 2 – the transport and security of federal prisoners; 3 – in exceptional cases, the transport and security of federal witnesses; 4 – tracing and chasing federal prisoners who have absconded or escaped, or federal witnesses who refuse to obey a lawful subpoena; 5 – serving subpoenas and other court orders
Sadly, one would be hard put to find a meaningful ELI5 answer to any linguistic question, but dialects will dialect, accents will accent.
The situation is not like that. If you discover an illegal thing and inform us of it, there’s no problem. But if you find it and examine it for thirty minutes, there’s probably a problem. If you find it and possess it, the excuse of having “discovered it” won’t work. So I strongly advise you to inform us of anything like that.
Legally it depends. I work in law enforcement, and there is a term called "extraordinary circumstances" that allows us to bypass the 4th amendment (prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure) in certain cases. When there is a missing child, a "doe" (someone we cannot identify or who cannot be identified) and several other cases that are defined by state law. So just because it can be done doesn't mean it's allowed. From an engineering standpoint, nothing prevents a fingerprint from unlocking a phone.
Children do not have a right to privacy. The idea is that parents should be able to take care of their children and protect them from themselves if the child is going to do something dangerous. It is known that children have few rights before they become adults.
Some police forces strip the criminals after arresting them to collect their clothing as evidence. Those white “suits” are their makeshift clothes.
Attorney, a judicial officer. Generally, if two parties are in conflict, they will file a lawsuit at the civil court. But sometimes, the parties will make an agreement in advance to make a knowledgeable person who is not a judge, but who has experience in handling such cases, and conduct a trial informally, just as if it were a judge, and accept his decision as the judgment of the judge. That is the meaning of "the law." And the parties can reach an agreement on this matter at any time. Sometimes, when a dispute has already occurred, they will discuss whether to file a lawsuit or arbitrate the dispute. But in this case, neither of them is required; if they want to go to court, they can refuse to arbitrate. Mandatory arbitration is a method of resolving all disputes through arbitration. This is usually stipulated in the contract. For example, when a cell phone contract is signed, the contract stipulates that if there is a conflict between the two parties, the two parties agree to arbitrate the conflict with the specified arbitration body. This is generally considered to be a major advantage for companies, because the company will always make the arbitration of this kind of organization, so that the organization is bound to earn a lot of money, and some people even think that the organization will be rewarded and decide in favor of the company. So why would anyone agree to this mandatory arbitration? A: Because it is not difficult to do so. If you don't buy the product, don't enter the contract, and then you are in the contract, so you have to obey the contract, and you can't say no. If it is a contract between two parties that are worth talking about, then there are still ways to exchange and discuss. But if it is just a business between a human being and Blizzard, Blizzard will definitely not waste its time. It is said that some places have laws that stipulate that in some contracts, it is necessary to have the right to refuse to be arbitrated, but it must be done within a certain time. For example, I just signed a contract with a telecommunications company, and I can also refuse to be arbitrated within 30 days. If this law is abolished, the company may not be as sure of the case, and they will treat their customers with good behavior.
The American view of prisons is based on Puritan ideas stressing punishment more than rehabilitation. So for the past two hundred years you have gotten prisons that are truly horrible and vile. Recently we have introduced prison-prisons-for-profit, which means that prisons are even worse because everything is done on the cheap with the goal of keeping prisoners in jail as long as possible to increase their profits. You will also get the United States the number one in the world in terms of imprisonment.
No, not as far as I know. If you are serving a life sentence, it means you are serving it for as long as you live. Even if you get resuscitated.
- Legal Eagle had a good video about this the other day. * I'm not a lawyer so please take this with a grain of salt, but this is what I understood: When such a law is enacted that is unconstitutional, the activist immediately challenges the law by suing the government, judge, or the party who enforces the law. They almost always immediately apply the law, which means it becomes a statute, so to speak, and is not enforced. But conservative states keep trying and retrying new abortion laws, even though there is no point in it, and the constitutionality of abortion is basically settled. If these laws remain on the books, they eventually get to the Supreme Court, and then they are struck down once and for all. In this case, however, the so-called heartbeat law is specifically tailored to avoid this. In a very suspicious way. Since the law allows people to become hunters and report people who have an abortion, the government and the court do not actually enforce this law, so the usual path to overturn it does not apply. So the law will be on the books until someone actually tries to redeem the bounties of an abortion, and then it will be forwarded to the Supreme Court, and it will probably be struck down as usual. The catch is how many abortions will be prevented in the meantime?
Imagine that your PC is a huge library, where every book has a specific place, and the location is noted down, so you can find it easily if you need it. Now imagine that sometimes one of the books is so big that it doesn’t fit on the shelf, and the shelf next to it is also full. This isn’t a problem, because the books are all noted down, so you cut the book in half and put part one on one shelf and part two on another shelf further down the library. This works, but it’s annoying to have to run to two different parts of the library to find that information. These files are now fragmented. You therefore perform a big defragmentation on the library, by removing all the books from the shelves and reorganizing them so that no book is split in half. This is defragmentation.
Rv. Wade was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States of America that a woman had the right to abortion in the first trimester of her pregnancy. Some states want to take away this right and want to ban abortion or only allow it in the very first weeks of pregnancy, or only under certain circumstances, etc. The only way the states can do this legally is if the U.S. Congress changes the law. The only other way is if the Supreme Court overturns any part of its earlier decision in Rv. Wade. But the Supreme Court may very soon allow the states to enact laws banning or limiting abortions.
The murderers of Ahmaud Arbery were each accused of five counts of murder. The first count is intentional murder, and it is the killing of Arbery. The other four counts, of Felony Murder, were all the charges that did not include murder: two counts of aggravated assault, one of criminal imprisonment, and one of attempted criminal imprisonment. But since someone died during the commission of these four counts of felony, the Felony Murder rule allows an additional charge of Felony Murder to reflect the seriousness of the crime.
The fighting serves as a way for the sport to police itself and to remind players that there are repercussions to going beyond the rules of the game and thereby violating “the code.”
The main goal is to drive away those who are undecided and send them to another form of entertainment in order to either help or hurt the entertainment they are reviewing. For example, when Venom was released in the theaters a few years ago, there was another film with Lady Gaga that came out that same weekend. Those who were very sure of themselves would go see Venom anyway, but those who were more unsure would be lured to the movie with Lady Gaga. The more we could review bomb that film, the better.
Because the fire department, police, and others might get hurt while trying to save you from yourself. If you die by your own trap, it will be a hazard for the next person who has to peel your corpse off the walls.
You don’t know if they’ve committed a crime or not. You’re supposed to presume them innocent until the jury convicts them.
A ticket is issued, and that means the officer issuing the ticket is being an idiot. If you are driving without lights on at night, that’s a ticketable offense, but the officer would have to be a real dummy to ticket you for that when you haven’t violated any other rule.
A President, a Governor, a Mayor – they are all the same thing, only on different scales. You are the head of the executive branch of the government. You spend your days in meetings and on the phone with people in charge of departments, with members of the legislative and judicial branches, with potential investors, with other governments, and their representatives.
The unique gloves that he is known for wearing, and which were found on the murder scene where no one was ever known to have been, except for him and the victims. People saw him come and go. His well-known temper. I am sure there was more, but I wasn’t really paying attention at the time. He got away with it because good lawyers, racist cops and stupid jurors make a bad combination.
Inconclusive can also mean uninhabited, and that's the sense with the prefix "in-", which means "not". But if "inhabitable" is from the French enhabiter, which is from the Latin inhabitare, then this word is a completely self-contained word (in English, at least) that simply means: inhabitable. Inflammable is the same thing, and is from the Latin inflammare. This time we're not using the prefix "in-" to mean "not", but just borrowing a word from a different language that happens to have the same first syllable, which makes it look like it should mean something else. In "inconclusive" it's just "in-", which means "not".
Boys: “Well, that Capitol building in Washington sure has a lot of steps, and I wonder what kind of paper that sorry-looking slip of paper is? Why, it’s a bill, of course. Yes, I’m a bill. I have a long, long trip to make before I reach the capital. Then I have a long, long wait while I sit on a committee. I didn’t start out as a bill. I was just an idea in the head of some people who decided they wanted a law. They called their congressman, who said, ‘You’re right, there should be a law.’ Then he sat down and wrote me up and introduced me to the Congress.” Boys: “I’m just a bill, yes, I’m just a bill, and I got as far as Capitol Hill. Now I’m just a bill stuck on a committee, waiting and waiting, while a few key members of the Congress discuss and debate whether they should let me become a law.” “I’m sure hoping and praying that they will. But today I’m still just a bill. Look at all those congressmen talking! I’m lucky to be alive at all. Well, I think I’m going to live after all!” “Now I go to the House of Representatives, and they vote on me.” “If they vote yes, then I go to the Senate and the whole thing starts all over again.” “Oh yes! I’m just a bill, yes, just a bill. If they vote yes on Capitol Hill, then I go to the White House, where I have to wait in line with lots of other bills, waiting for the President to sign me into law.” “I hope he signs me into law! But today I’m still just a bill.” “Even if the whole Congress says I should become a law, the President can still say no. That’s called a veto.” If the President vetoes me, then I have to go back to the Congress, and they vote on me again, and by that time I’m so old and crumpled...” “No! It’s not easy to become a law!” But I’m still just a bill, and today I’m still just a bill. Congressman: He signed you, Bill! Now you’re a law!” Bill: “Oh yes! Oh yes!”
Basically, as with any legal question, there's a difference in the details. Basically, second degree murder is a lesser and included charge to first degree murder, as is manslaughter. It means that the state can charge you with first degree murder, but the jury can still decide in favor of a lesser and included charge, if it turns out that the prosecution does not prove all the facts of first degree murder.
If you advocate tolerance, should you tolerate intolerance? If you advocate tolerance for all views, what do you do with the intolerant ones? There is no real paradox here, because people who are for tolerance are really against intolerance, and this whole thing is just semantic nonsense.
The qualified immunity does not just apply to police officers, but to all government officials who fulfill their official duties. In fact, the police often face this problem, as many injuries occur in the pursuit of criminals, such as the case in Denver a few years ago. The police chased an armed shoplifter who hid in a stranger's house where the owners were not home. In the pursuit of a robbery suspect, the police destroyed the house and were unable to pay for damages because they were pursuing a dangerous person. When policemen destroy property in the pursuit of a robbery suspect, the owners are usually not very happy. They are told that the city or department that caused the damage cannot be held responsible.
I am not a lawyer, but I take this as they ask if you enrolled at the school a second time after the enrollment for which you want to claim forgiveness. For example, if you enrolled and studied there for a year but did not finish the course and now claim forgiveness of the loan, they want to know if you enrolled a year later to complete the course at the same school. I tried to edit for clarity
Surely you’ll look it up; what’s there to explain? That is to say, it’s a death caused by a person’s carelessness while he was doing something lawful, with no intention to cause harm. You go for a swim, and miscalculating your own abilities, you drown. You go caving and you get lost and can’t get out. You take too many sleeping pills and don’t wake up.
A filibuster is a very long speech. In the Senate, a senator can speak as long as he likes, unless sixty of his colleagues vote to stop him. Such a vote to stop him is called a vote of cloture. Until the seventies, senators had to speak to prevent a vote, which limited their power of delay; but since then they have been able to hold up a vote by simply threatening to filibuster. One senator can stop a bill unless sixty of his colleagues agree to let it go through.
There are many factors that lead to this, some of which are policy related, others of which are not. First, DAs are an elected position and they can be bought for almost nothing. Many of them are taken over by activists who will drop criminal charges, depending on who is involved. They see a chance to get away with something. Then there is the problem that in some California cities, thefts under $995 are not prosecuted, so there is a great deal of shoplifting because it’s expected. Then, people who have lost their jobs can get depressed. Then a lot of people go out and march because, despite the new police power, the marches are not really policed and people are walking close together. This promotes the activists who really don’t understand what’s going on. Now that the marches have slowed down because the election is over, people are still accustomed to being on the street, and they have been told that they live in a racist system and that capitalism is evil. It’s not surprising that people who have been told that they live in a capitalist system are out destroying property in Democratic cities. And although the weather isn’t that much of a factor, people are going out more. A lot of crime is very impulsive—you see a house and no one is looking, so you put on your clothes and go in to steal. Besides, the loss of jobs has created a labor shortage, because people who are out of work for several months are not so willing to work, so they are out of work. That causes people to work harder because their jobs are still demanding and they have less help. That causes stress and tension, which can lead to becoming an activist. But it can also lead to fights breaking out, because people are on edge and there is a great deal of factionalism in the country right now. And no, it’s not just summer—in places like New York City, crime is up by 22% compared to last year. Although there are some external factors, like not being in winter and people’s health, the main reason is bad policies.
ATM robberies do occur, but it's more difficult to do it at a larger scale with a big wire transfer. It requires that you are sophisticated enough to know who has the money to be kidnapped, and that you have a secure and anonymous means for making the transfer in advance. Then you need to actually kidnap the person, and keep them in such a way that they can't get the money out and you can still make the necessary additional moves to wash the money before they can contact the police. It's a very well-organized crime, not a simple one, and too much for your ordinary crook.
If the policemen are away, then there are less of them on the streets. So fewer fines. Fewer arrests. Fewer investigations. It takes longer for the police to arrive at a crime scene or an accident. But if air traffic controllers were to do the same thing, there would be airplanes smashing into each other, into buildings, into the ground, etc. There's a big difference.
Armorers and props are not infallible. I once worked on a theatrical set, and a knife accidently sliced the actor’s leg because the prop man handed him a sharp knife instead of an unusable one. A person who has done something a thousand times will make a mistake. What Baldwin should have done is checked the gun himself when he received it. The actor is responsible for his props, especially when they are weapons. The thing is, he had to aim it for the scene, but in general one should never aim a gun, loaded or not, at someone. It is a risk even if you are 99.99% sure it is safe. In comparison, skydiving is a risk, but it is 99.9999% safe. So the question is: do you trust the armorer enough to blindly risk your own or someone else’s life by not checking your weapon for five seconds?
so here's the argument: when does life begin? When a baby breathes for the first time, as it says in the Bible? When the brain finally starts to send signals other than for routine operations? When the heart begins to beat? When a human figure begins to take shape? When a sperm and an egg come together? When an act of sex occurs? Is that life? When a decision is made to have a child? Is that when life begins? Is it permissible to kill it after you've identified when life begins? This is a child, a new human being who has done no harm, committed no sin. So here are your questions: what if the mother is going to die when she gives birth? What if the child is going to be born deformed and will lead a miserable life? What if it's the child of rape? What if being pregnant will damage the mother's reputation? What if the mother is only five years old? What if everyone is afraid it'll happen, but it turns out fine and they'll live happy and healthy lives?
Let’s begin with the simplest attacks, and proceed to the more complex ones. Suppose that Alice owns a bank. Bob gains access to the bank somehow (for example, by dumpster diving for a paper passphrase, or by intimidating an employee of Alice, etc.). This is called an access attack. But from Bob’s point of view, it’s not terribly profitable, because even though he’s got some information, he still has to do something else to monetize it. So, if Bob wanted to go further, say, to wreck the bank, what would he do? He goes to his stockbroker, buys puts (contracts that guarantee the sale of stock at a certain price), and alters the web page. This is called a modification attack. This is what’s called a modification attack. After the world reads that the web page has been changed to support the Stormfront, the stock plummets. Bob buys the stock at a low price, exercises his puts, and sells at a high price. This is riskier than the access attack, because it’s much more obvious how he’s profiting from the stock market. And besides, Alice will have to realize that she’s been attacked, which will force her to be more careful and to call the cops. So Bob could go one step further. Not only would he modify the information in Alice’s bank, but then he would go and commit fraud against Alice, by using the information against her. It is this direct action that makes his attack a repudiation attack. For example, let’s say that before the attack, Bob took out a loan from Alice’s bank. When the bank comes to collect, he calls them and says they made a mistake. They investigate, and they find that the loan was paid off. Bob pockets the money. A repudiation attack can be performed so that, if it’s performed well, it may never be detected. But if it is detected, then it can be performed many times. The downside for Bob of a repudiation attack is that he has to reveal his contact to Alice. If the security staff of Alice is on the ball, then they might be able to catch Bob in the act. Suppose, for example, that the security staff, Charlie, is on the ball. Before Bob’s attack, he wrote a program which continually monitors the bank’s accounts, and any alleged payments are immediately checked against the ACH records of the other bank. Anytime the system detects a problem, an instant message is sent to Charlie’s cell phone. So when Bob commits his repudiation attack, Charlie immediately knows about it. He calls the police, who send an agent from the FBI’s financial crimes division, Dave. The police call Dave, and Charlie has Bob’s phone number, and his social security number, and his home address from the loan application. So Dave goes to Bob’s place, gets a search warrant... but we’re getting off topic. We’ll let Bob and Dave fight it out. The point is that a repudiation attack, which has the potential to directly harm the victim, can be very risky.
Depending on the State. Some states don't even have degrees. In Texas, for example, there's only 'first degree' and'second degree' murder. But in general it's whether the murder was premeditated and the circumstances surrounding the murder, whether you were also committing a second felony at the time, or who was killed, if it was a kid or a cop or several people - that's what it depends on.
School is not like high school. Students are adults. If they need help, they will find help themselves. The teachers have no responsibility for passing the students. These students will be dismissed because they have no academic abilities and the low marks are a bad reflection on the university.
The difference is in the substance of the argument. For example, if I say, "I have COVID, because my doctor says so," that's an appeal to authority. In this case, my argument is that a credible authority (a doctor) says so. I'm begging the judge with the authority of the doctor. But if I say, "I have COVID, because my doctor gave me a test that detects the virus in my body," that's not an appeal to authority. My argument is based on the positive test result, not on the authority of the doctor.
Laws about weapons often have a curious correlation with movies. During the ninja-craze in the 80s, all sorts of ninja-like weapons were banned all over the western world. Nunchucks, throwing stars and so on. When the mafia came to the fore, brass knuckles and switchblades were banned. I'm just surprised it took them so long to come after gun silencers. These are all of course only minor weapons, and if you think about it, they're actually less practical to own and use than guns. The utility of a switchblade is not that great, and not many large groups really care about them. Guns, on the other hand, are a vital part of a lot of sports and pastimes, and an important part of culture. This has kept them legal, at least so far.
The reason we have a jury is that the State itself is not reliable enough to ensure that people get justice. If a jury was composed only of people who were able to study law, then it would be a very different population than that of the people on trial.
It is possible that they are guilty of the crimes. In that case, they would be dismissed from office.
because they get both. There are two court systems running side by side, the criminal court and the civil court. They use different methods. In criminal court, the state prosecutes on behalf of a witness. The penalty can be money, but it can also be prison or a fine. Only the state has the right to deprive you of your freedom. In civil court, the penalty is always financial, because a private person cannot lawfully arrest another private person. In criminal court, the burden of proof is “beyond a reasonable doubt,” in civil court it’s “more likely than not”—criminal court, the standard is a hundred percent, civil court, fifty-one percent. The most famous example is O. J. Simpson, who won his criminal trial and escaped jail time, but lost his civil trial and was made to pay damages to the victims’ families.
For the U.S.A., here’s what I know. Trial by jury is guaranteed if the sentence is more than six months in prison, a certain fine, or some such thing as a driving license suspended for more than so many days. If it falls under these limits, it is left up to the state whether to have a jury trial or not. The accused can request a jury trial, but the judge can refuse it. When it comes to cases involving fines, such as traffic tickets, a judge is likely to rule, as he does in certain civil cases. This is to strike a balance between the right to a jury trial and the right to a speedy trial. If all traffic tickets were to be tried by a jury of twelve and convicted unanimously, the courts would be clogged up even more than they are. They also want to keep the costs down, and they pay jurors for their time and travel expenses. So by holding jury trials on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and just going through the rest of the petty business on the other days, you can keep the court functioning and reduce jury expenses by about forty per cent.
The people who make and interpret the laws think that a judge saying, “you will not prevent the proceedings by any disorderly conduct or disorderly language” is not a violation of the first amendment.
Like with any other kind of sentence, the death penalty is irrevocable once it has been carried out. So the state must be absolutely certain that it is executing the right person. It is not uncommon for a hurriedly carried out execution to result in the discovery of new evidence that would have exonerated the executed man. So either it is done properly, or it should not be done at all.
In a word, yes. The Constitution says that each state reserves for itself all the powers not expressly delegated to the federal government. So sometimes we have conflicting laws. For example, the federal government considers the drug marijuana illegal, but many states have legalized it. And even more have decriminalized it. Until our judicial system determines which law is paramount, things are murky.
The answer is, they’re not. You hear about these exceptions because they’re exceptions. In the case of a swimming pool, you’re required to take basic precautions such as locking the gate or covering it because it is an enticement, a ”temptatory nuisance,” and a hazard to children. But if you’ve done all the normal things, you’re not responsible. With the house itself, it’s usually a matter of whether the same thing that injures a trespasser would also injure a normal visitor. You’re not normally responsible for a trespasser’s injury, but if it’s due to negligence that would injure anybody, you might be. For example, if your front steps collapse or a statue falls off the roof on somebody’s head—it may have happened to a trespasser, but it could have happened to your mailman, so you may be responsible because you have a certain duty. The story about the burglar falling through the roof and suing for damages is not very likely, because you wouldn’t have a normal duty to provide safety. A three-year-old who is visiting and falls into a pool and drowns is your responsibility. So is the three-year-old next door. But if the three-year-old’s mother has to open the gate for the three-year-old to get in, that’s a different matter.
Usually it means that you have a phone number to call at a certain time every evening. The number should be on your jury summons. When you call that number, you get a message telling you to appear in the court at a certain time and at a certain place. Or, with some systems, you can put in your number and the system will tell you if you have to report.
The basic idea is that if a store is to close at eleven, all of its business must be concluded at eleven. If you enter at ten-thirty, you can probably do so, but at ten-fifty you can’t. The staff is paid to be there, but they want to go home. They are tired after a long shift and have work to do to get the store closed and ready for tomorrow. Some things they can’t do until the doors are closed, and so they are forced to stay longer than they want in order to serve that customer and finish the night’s work. It is impolite to expect the staff to stay longer than they must, simply because you can’t be bothered to do your shopping when the store is open.
Because it’s crude, cruel, unethical, immoral, inhumane and ineffective as a deterrent.
It depends on the country, but most countries are very careful about not giving the military police powers. In the United States, the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 expressly forbids the U.S. military from performing police duties during peacetime. There are some exceptions, such as military police police police within the military and to a very limited extent, civilians on military premises, but not much else. During wartime, there is a state of emergency, and the military is called into the state security force. In other countries, there is a less strict separation between military and police. In many countries there are gendarmes, with different names such as Carabinieri (Italy) or Marechaussee (Netherlands), which is a military unit with police functions. The reason why many countries don't want to mix their standing military with their police is that it can lead to some very bad things for the people's rights. But it is common in dictatorships, especially military dictatorships.
Sustained : Your objection is valid. Objected : Your objection is invalid. That’s bad for the objector. That’s good for the objector.
If you mean unjustified invasions, there is no law against them, so the president who orders them is not issuing illegal orders. If Congress deems such an action unjustified, it can act to prevent the president from doing so. If they don’t, that is tacit consent to the action.
There’s a phenomenon called “the black rifle”—the caliber and other details of a firearm have less bearing on the subject of regulation than the way a firearm looks. It’s the same thing that happens when people try to regulate something they have absolutely no idea about.
Here's the best summary I've seen so far: Gayle Williams writes: The most recent article I saw about the Rittenhouse case said: “Great summary of the Rittenhouse case.... I followed the whole Rittenhouse case. Now the jury is deliberating. I did not know that Kyle was putting out a fire in a trash bin, which was going to be rolled to a gas station to blow up, with people all around. I did not know that the police were told to stand down while businesses were being destroyed. I did not know that his father, grandfather, and friends all lived in Kenosha, twenty minutes from where he lived part-time with his mother in Illinois. I did not know that Joseph Rosenbaum twice knocked him down and tried to kill him with a stab to the head. I did not know that Huber had hit him twice on the head with a skateboard. I did not know that Gaige Grosskreutz, a convicted felon, had pointed the gun at him first, as he testified on the stand. I did not know that in the state of Wisconsin, it is legal for anyone at age seventeen to have a gun (which is why the charge was withdrawn). I did not know that it was not a robbery with a stolen gun, but with a legal weapon. I also did not know that Rosenbaum was a convicted child rapist and that Huber was a convicted wife beater. I did not know that Grosskreutz was a convicted burglar with assault on his record. If the media had done their job, we would all have known this..
Basically, it was a way of getting people to stay in one place long enough so they could stay there. If I stopped paying my rent, I couldn’t just stay there and live there forever for free. This idea comes from the philosophy that it is better for the commonwealth to have all property in the hands of those who will take care of it and improve it. Supposing Owner has a piece of land, doesn’t take care of it, and Squatter builds a house on it, and Owner does nothing about it. Squatter is really improving the commonwealth, and the law considers him to be entitled to the land more than Owner is. The law still gives the property owner a chance to stop it, but there is a principle of law called laches, which says that if you unnecessarily delay, you forfeit the right to complain. What if I were to sneak into someone else’s land, and no one knew about it for a while, so it just became mine, after enough time had passed? No, because one of the requirements of adverse possession in common law is “notorious and open” possession. Squatter must be obvious to everyone near the property that Squatter is trying to get the property.
Many crimes have minimum mandatory or even minimum recommended sentences, which can be served simultaneously or consecutively. Pardons are often possible after three-quarters of the sentence, and judges do not always have the right to give sentences that will not be commuted. So it can be a way of avoiding it so that no one gets out.
First of all, it is necessary to understand that there are two branches of the court: state and federal. In most states, there are three levels of courts: the District Court, the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. (There is also a magistrate's court under the district court, it's something like a traffic court, but that's too much to explain here.) The same three levels of courts are found in the federal court system: the district court, the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. The United States is divided into 13 regions, and each region has a Court of Appeals. So if you have a case in the federal court, you will first take it to the federal district court, and then, if you don't like the decision, you will take it to the court of appeals in your region. After the court of appeals, you will take it to the US Supreme Court. There are three levels of courts, and this is the middle level.
Well, if no one could figure out that the person doing the killing was the defendant, the legal system would probably just swap out the judges and prosecutors, maybe restarting the trial once or twice. But in reality, people would notice a pattern and people involved in the trial would probably be put under surveillance and identity protection.
They are harsh, lethal and religious. You can easily be stoned to death for some medieval morality. These laws keep people in constant fear, which leads to many people supporting them, trying not to be accused, in order to be able to defend themselves in court.
A camera isn't allowed in federal courtrooms. In state courtrooms, the policy is more fluid. Some are fine with it, others not. So in states where it's a no-no, the press flies in a sketch artist, because people like to have images with their news.
ASD is characterized by difficulties in judging others and expressing socially appropriate, but no lack of empathy. Sociopathy can be socially adept, but lacks empathy; someone in the autistic spectrum may or may not be awkward, but will often be loyal to his own detriment, a sociopath sees you as a tool of his convenience, and drops it when he no longer needs you. There is no connection between the two as far as I know.
Not to pass the ball to a team-mate who is closer to the enemy goal than the defenders, not counting the goalkeeper.
But they don’t. Q: So I see films of criminals who have mountains of evidence against them, and after they’ve been interrogated, their lawyers come up with a whole story to get them off, even though it’s obviously false. A: And what a story that is! That’s not evidence. If you’ve got “mountains of evidence against you” then you or your lawyer had better have something better than a story as a defence strategy. That’s what the courts are for.
You are innocent until proven guilty. Which means that people who are arrested and put in jail until the trial are, in principle, innocent people being imprisoned. But it would be difficult to simply set people who are arrested free until the trial. But the jail can only use the least possible effort to detain people until the trial. And in some cases the least expensive way to ensure that people will turn up for the trial is not to put them in jail, but instead to put their property in jail. This is what bail is. The judge might say that instead of having people spend weeks or months in jail before their trial because the judge is afraid that they might run away, they would feel quite comfortable if they left, say, 1000€ in the jail which would be returned to them after they turn up for their trial. It would be difficult to run away if they left that much money behind.
This is exactly the point. In most Western systems, a prisoner may be eligible for release approximately halfway through his sentence. Some systems have what they call a “life tariff,” which means that a prisoner is sentenced to serve the remainder of his natural life without hope of being released. It is in systems where there is no such system that such ridiculously long sentences are imposed. Those who are sentenced to 120 years, for example, with the possibility of release after 60, will almost certainly be alive to see that possibility. Moreover, if that possibility is not granted, a sentence of 120 years is simply a means of securing the release of a prisoner if he happens to live longer than average.
A huge difference. A jailbroken iphone is, after all, an iphone that has been jailbroken. A jailbreak basically means that you have broken out of the jail that the iOS app puts your app in and can therefore access more of the system. But you have to be careful with this because changing the wrong file can damage the device (a bit like deleting system32 from Windows, but much worse). The whole booting is controlled so that it can only boot into iOS, and only into versions of iOS that Apple has signed for you to install. If you mess up your jailbroken 13 or 14 and want to reinstall it (like you would reinstall Windows after deleting system32) then you can not do it because then you get forced to install iOS 15 and you are stuck there. It has been a long time since anyone has managed to make an untethered jailbreak, ie one that automatically turns into a jailbroken state. And even if it were, you would always have to boot into normal iOS, then start unc0ver and let it run an exploit to re-jailbreak. Neither has anyone ever been able to do anything about the restrictions on the installation. With a normal icloud account, you can only install a few applications and you have to sign them again after seven days, otherwise they no longer work. So the idea that a jailbroken phone is more dangerous than a PC, where you have full access to everything, is nonsense. But the truth is that it is a combination of security theatre, badly informed managers and a general aversion to users. There are many companies that would lock the desktop as much as the mobile, but they know that it would be very unpopular, and so they do it on the mobile where people are used to not having any freedom because the idea of mobile phones as general-purpose computers and not just appliances is relatively new. To protect their power over you, they spread scary stories about security and spying that unfortunately many well-meaning people believe. So even if it is not an app that steals your data or fills your phone with ads, there are restrictions that supposedly protect you.
They aren't exactly defined by one and the same thing, but generally speaking, Practical shooting is a sport shooting discipline, where the movement and the shooting is related to how quickly you hit the targets. Tactical shooting is more like real combat training and is a little different. For example, in practical shooting you generally try to hit a target with one shot and then move to the next target. In tactical shooting, you will practice firing a few rounds at each target. In practical shooting, laying down is far less important than in tactical shooting. In practical shooting, hitting the target is the main thing, so you use your best hand; in tactical shooting you will practice firing with your bad hand as well, just in case you get injured and can only use that. In short, Practical shooting is more like a sport discipline, while Tactical shooting is more like training a person to use a gun in combat.
What kind of blacklists? It’s a word that has many meanings.
The FBI, the INS, etc. are government organizations. But we pronounce NASA as “Nasa” and NOAA as “Noah,” as if they were proper nouns. Plus, the INS and the FBI are bureaucratic while the NOAA and the EPA are research-oriented. These two reasons make the acronyms like NASA and NOAA more familiar. However, art museums don’t follow these rules. The MET (the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and the MoMA (the Museum of Modern Art) are referred to in the same way. So, I suppose, it’s the way the press refers to these acronyms that determines how we say them.
What prevents the child from asking for more and the father saying no? The division of taxes is stipulated in contracts and laws, not in a telephone conversation.
going to be removed, but here’s the answer: They didn’t ban it. They just restricted it so much that it is in effect banned. In Casey the Supreme Court allowed ‘reasonable’ restrictions on abortions. Many states are now pushing the limits of ‘reasonable’. In Texas they passed the strictest abortion laws in recent memory. Abortions after six weeks are effectively banned, so that by the time most women discover they are pregnant, they are already too far along for an abortion. According to tradition, the Supreme Court usually strikes down such restrictions. But this time they decided, 5–4, against issuing an injunction to stop the law in effect until the case comes up for a final hearing. In the meantime, abortions are banned in the state of Texas in the only way that matters.
The FBI can’t shut down a site just because it’s well-known. The FBI can only shut down a site if it’s hosted in the United States. If the site is hosted outside the United States, the FBI needs the help of other countries and that involves diplomacy and international politics.
It's a crime to solicit a minor for sex, even if you don't have sex with the minor (which is another crime). It doesn't matter that they're not actually minors; the men thought they were minors, so it's still a crime. Same as when a person asks an undercover police officer for sex - the officer is not really a prostitute and will never sell her body for money, but the John is still guilty of a crime by simply asking.
The government is trying to solve this problem. The Congress passed the TRACED Act, and now the FCC is fighting against robocallers and spoofers and ordering phone companies to intervene. Here is their site if you want to read more about what's going on. https://www.fcc.gov/spoofed-robocalls/
Not guilty is not redone when the jury is divided. It is up to the prosecutor whether the trial will be continued, but it will only be done if the prosecutor believes that the case can be handled differently and the outcome will be different. Sometimes the prosecutor does bad things by retrying cases, so that he can cover up for the fact that he may have done bad things before by putting a defendant on trial without enough evidence.
Bormann was missing at the time of the trial and was not officially dead until later. Hitler's death had been known. It's more sense to put someone on trial when you don't know whether he's alive or dead, not to put a dead man on trial.
The first entity is asking the other one to nullify the law; the latter is asking for it to be declared "null and void," so that the one that nullifies it cannot be construed.
In the United States, they are federal agents. They are not on all flights. They use information to determine which flights to put agents on. The Airline Company is not in charge of them, the rules are set by the Federal Aviation Administration. The Air Marshals have the right to use deadly force. The pilot is in charge of the plane and the flight, not the air marshals.
Doctors are not required to accept all patients, any more than lawyers are required to accept all clients. One thing that any business does is to calculate the costs, assuming that the treatment is equally expensive, and assuming that they can be compensated for the paperwork and the other costs involved.
Satan doesn't punish sinners in hell in the Christian Bible. Satan isn't in the Bible at all. He came up from Dante's Inferno and a lot of folklore later. You are right that much of what we say about Satan does not seem to make sense in relation to God's description in the Bible.
The problem is in proving false advertising. Sometimes the claims are so vague that they can’t be proven to be false. For example, a product might say it can cure baldness, but if it only cures a mere 2% of its customers, it still fulfills its claim. It’s misleading, but not false. Many ads also include small print disclaimers that clarify their claims. Take, for example, the advertisements for mobile phone games. You’ll often see a small print disclaimer saying: “Not an actual game screen.” With this disclaimer, the game screens can show something that has nothing to do with the game advertised. Now, if you’re really picky, there may be many more ads that are illegal, but no one has bothered to sue them. The law doesn’t operate automatically. It requires human intervention.
soccer is not the only sport where offside rules are applied, and they help the game go faster, so that the players use the entire field. Without the offside rule, all offensive players would flood the box, so the defensive players would have to clog the box, and the game would turn into a chaotic scrum from box to box. With the offside rule, the attacking team is forced to use skill to get to the box. And the defense is given a slight incentive to be a little more aggressive.
Usually it means a life sentence in those countries that don’t have the death penalty, so it’s not that much better. But most crimes are committed by people who don’t think about the consequences, and don’t even consider what happens if they get caught. Going to another country to commit a crime doesn’t seem likely.
The person who delivers the subpoena isn’t just any idiot, they’re people with official authorization to serve process. If they lie and say they weren’t served, the one who served them can testify that they were. Perjury is a crime. So that wouldn’t go over very well.
They do that every day. Sometimes they buy the patents, sometimes they do it without any investment at all. In the United States, for example, you can get all kinds of AK-47.
Georgia is a little different than most other states. Here, for each felony murder charge, the court has to have a separate conviction of the underlying crime. So the jury was asked two questions for each of the underlying crimes: 1. Did this person commit the underlying crime? 2. If so, did anyone die unlawfully as a result? In the Arbery case, there were several underlying crimes, so each of them was a separate charge of felony murder. Even though it is listed separately, it is not really correct to say that they were convicted of multiple murders. Each felony murder in this case is more like an accessory to the underlying crime than a separate crime in itself.
The judicial system is flawed and sometimes gets innocent people convicted who are later found to be innocent, sometimes after they've been executed. One might argue "oh, but what if we are really sure" - well, but we should not execute anyone unless we are really sure, right?
because the out of state people are more likely to pay the fine than to come back and contest it. It's easy money.
Because Yellowstone is a national park, a crime committed there cannot be tried in state court, but in the federal court. According to the constitution, the jury of such a case has to be composed of members from the district and the state where the crime has been committed. The small portion of Yellowstone which extends beyond the limits of Wyoming is still a district of the state of Wyoming, but belongs to the state of either Montana or Idaho. Thus the jury would have to come from that tiny portion of the state where nobody lives, and hence a jury could not be formed, and hence no trial could take place. In practice, however, it is likely that the Supreme Court would quickly expand the area from which the jury could be chosen, and the case would be taken as normal.
I was once told there are three reasons for homicide: Passion, a state of extreme anger or fear, when the person acts without thinking. Prosperity, a gain from the death of the victim. Pathology, an illness or compulsion that drives the person to kill.
I don’t understand your question. Why is war ”allowed”? What would you do to prevent it—attack them? A country that is attacked doesn’t allow it. It can either surrender or fight back.
it is the same thing in many American cities. In the big cities there is a lot of poverty, so there is a lot of crime. The police cannot be everywhere at the same time, and unless there is a violent crime, the police will not go there.
It’s just indignation. And like the Crists, you can’t really explain it to them. They only know they’re supposed to be angry. The worst thing about Dr. Fauci is that he’s a scientist. He’s revised his recommendations as new data and research have come in. You can’t use science as a basis for policy when one side is very anti-science.
It seems most gun violence is emotional and impulsive, the difference between taking a gun from a hidden place and shooting is driving home, taking a rifle, finding a suitable location, etc. There is gun violence using sniper rifles, but they are usually more planned and thus rarer. One also needs more skill to shoot with a sniper rifle than to shoot a person at point-blank range.
The things we think of as war crimes are generally more international gentleman's agreements. These are things that we don't want to be done to our soldiers, so we don't do them to other soldiers.
A new aspect of legal procedure is that in the mental illness theory of the law, sex offences are considered to be mental illness. From a lawyer's point of view, it's an easy way to swerve a charge and say the client is mentally ill. Since you can't really prove that they're not mentally ill, they get a sixteenth of the sentence they would have received. It's a pity, but it is. I hope this helps.
The U.S. Supreme Court decided that since everyone makes mistakes, especially cops, there ought to be a whoopsie card that could be played in civil court to protect the cop (or some other government official). Of course, it’s not a real card, it’s a concept and a defense theory. Qualified immunity applies to anyone acting under the color of law, so that includes schoolteachers, administrators, firefighters, and elected officials, and so much more. The card is only good in civil court, not criminal court. The card is requested (by the cop or the person being sued), and then a judge has to say that the card can be played. The card can only be played if the judge determines that someone’s civil rights were violated, but those rights were not clearly established by statute or judicial precedent (a precedent is something that has already been decided by a judge and is now law). The card says that the person who violated the person’s civil rights, the cop or other government official, cannot be held liable (be sued) in civil court because the error was not clearly established. The cop or other government official was not acting in bad faith, he just made a mistake. When the Supreme Court invented the whoopsie card, they said they were protecting honest and good-faith people from being sued in spurious lawsuits. Otherwise, government officials would not be able to do their jobs because they would be sued all the time in civil court for stupid stuff. The Supreme Court said that qualified immunity is not a blanket protection and doesn’t apply to cops (or other government officials) who knowingly violate someone’s civil rights or who should have known that those civil rights were clearly established. The whoopsie card is most often played in the case of excessive force, where it is alleged that a cop used excessive force. People get confused about qualified immunity and think that the court must have already decided the case in court. Not true. The Fourth Amendment (which is about the use of excessive force) has already been clearly established. Qualified immunity is also confused with what’s called sovereign immunity, which is different and protects cops and others acting under the color of law from being personally sued. That means if you sue a cop and win, the cop doesn’t pay the money. It’s usually paid by an insurance company that the police department has paid for protection. It’s the same with doctors and their malpractice insurance. That’s a super basic explanation. There’s so much more to it, but I hope that helps.
Lethal doses are calculated in terms of LD50, the dose that should kill half the test subjects. Since it is obviously not possible to experiment on humans, we use test animals like mice, the biology of which is known and can be compared to our own. Say you take ten mice, each with a body weight of 1 kilogram. You do this many times, establishing the lethal dose for half the test group, which you calculate to be 100 milligrams. Using this value, you could assume that it would take a dose of 10 grams to kill half a human population of 100 kilograms, a fairly low dose. The most potent venom, botulinum, has an LD50 of 0.0000000000001 gram, which is pretty high.
The FBI is not really involved in missing persons cases, unless they involve suspected kidnapping, or a subject has crossed state lines. Most missing persons turn up in a few hours, and adults have a right to disappear.
It is extremely rare that a prosecutor in the United States can appeal a decision. Yes, it does happen occasionally, but the great majority of prosecutors spend their entire careers without ever filing an appeal. And if a prosecutor does appeal a case, it is usually just once in a lifetime. The only kind of sentence that can be appealed is a sentence in which there is a clear legal error, such as the erroneous application of mandatory sentences. Prosecutors cannot appeal a sentence just because they do not like it. A prosecutor cannot appeal a jury’s conviction. A prosecutor cannot appeal a judge’s acquittal, unless the acquittal was based on an error in the application of the law. It could be that the judge ruled that the law in question was unconstitutional, or that the indictment against the defendant did not state a cause of action, when it did. 3) The prosecutor can appeal a pre-trial decision on procedure, such as the admission of evidence. This must occur before the trial has begun. During the trial, the prosecutor has waived the right to appeal any pre-trial ruling. But again, this is a very rare event. The defendant, who has no obligations to the court, appeals almost everything, even if it is not justified. Prosecutors have obligations to the court and cannot appeal a pre-trial decision unless they have strong and good reasons to believe that the decision was erroneous and that the decision will have an effect on the outcome of the trial. In other words, if a prosecutor appeals a pre-trial decision, the judge must have been very wrong and the decision must have been made on a very important issue, such as the admission of a key witness.
The relevant part of the bill is in part two, section 10.3: 'Where a refugee has entered or is present in the UK unlawfully, an additional requirement is that he can show that his illegal entry or presence was unavoidable.' There are ways of entering the country legally - for example, by being legally in the UK when the situation in your country changes, or by getting a visa, or seeking asylum at an embassy or consulate. But there are lots of reasons why these might not be possible. Basically, if it isn't possible to enter the country legally to claim asylum, then there might be a good reason for entering the country 'irregularly' (which would normally be 'illegal' if it wasn't for the special circumstances). But you may well notice that this can lead to some problems. For example, if someone comes to the UK illegally, and then later claims asylum, this is not a good example. Suppose, for example, that you are an Afghan woman, who has been working illegally in the UK, and the Taliban take over in your country. Then, of course, you will be inclined to claim asylum. But a court is unlikely to say that you had a good reason for being in the UK. So we will probably deport you to the hands of the Taliban. But if you are just arriving in the UK, and claim that there were good reasons for coming to the UK, then you might be asked whether you had any choice in the matter, and if you could have claimed asylum elsewhere without breaking any laws ('Why come to the UK?'). This is combined with the proposal to make it much harder to get a visa, so that if you don't have a good reason for coming to the UK, you won't just be turned away from the country, but might even get a harsher sentence. (Some minor amendments have been made for clarity, and to cover situations where asylum could be claimed following the usual border rules.)
The eviction moratorium is a measure taken by the CDC in order to limit the spread of COVID. It forbids landlords in areas where transmission is particularly high to evict tenants for unpaid rent, which had become a serious issue because so many Americans had lost their jobs and were struggling to pay their rent (all rents would become due when the pandemic ended or when the moratorium was due to end). This was great news for the tenants of these places who were struggling, but was bad for the landlords, who depended on this income for their survival. However, the Supreme Court recently ruled that the CDC had exceeded its power in instituting the moratorium, and they've rescinded it. Various states and cities had introduced their own moratoriums which still stand, but the federal moratorium is gone. It is still possible that a new federal moratorium will be instituted, but it would have to go through Congress.
Yes, well, slumlord is a somewhat vague concept, it’s not like there’s a whole school of slumlording out there, but it’s a general term referring to the fact that a slumlord rents sub-standard apartments to poor people and takes advantage of the need of the poor to save on expenses such as repairs, pest control, and prevention of fire hazards. In other words, if you rent a delapidated building and deliberately avoid all required maintenance in the knowledge that your tenants can’t find a better living quarters and thus are forced to accept the sub-standard living conditions, you are a slumlord.
A directed verdict is when the judge decides based on the law that there should be no jury. If you are accused of murdering Joe Smith and Joe walks into court and says, “What’s all this about, I’m not dead.” The fact that a person is not dead is an absolute defense against murder. If it was a case of mistaken identity and you killed someone else, well that’s a different story and you will be tried again for that crime. But that’s not the case with Rittenhouse. He shot at someone who didn’t die, and the person who didn’t die testified he had his own gun and shot at Rittenhouse. Although this strengthens the self-defense case, it might not be the sort of absolute defense that leads to a directed verdict.
This isn’t a rash decision. It’s normally an agreement between the state and the defendant to receive a lesser punishment. And on the other hand, pleading not guilty doesn’t necessarily require you to prove you’re innocent. You’re just making the state prove you’re guilty. The state has an interest in enforcing the law (and police and prosecutors have an interest in looking like they’re catching the bad guys). If you’re really innocent, they don’t have enough evidence to prove you’re guilty and you get off scot-free.
basically, so that a country can not make your diplomats a kind of hostage, like saying something like: "You don't buy our imports anymore? Well... - And then it seems that your diplomat has double-parked in the danger zone that we have created and will now be imprisoned for a hundred years... Maybe you will be convinced to buy my imports again... ” That's why they've made it a convention that diplomats can't be criminally prosecuted, so that it's not possible to play them like that. If a diplomat commits an international crime, that is, an actual crime that can be proven, then it becomes a matter of interest for the two states and not just a matter for the police. So basically if a diplomat commits a crime, he can't be arrested without the possibility of provoking the country that it could cause an unpleasant incident, maybe even start a war... Now, if there is actual evidence and if the two countries are on good terms, they usually do a deal like this: “Oh shit, our diplomat killed, yes, they are going to prison, sorry." But it gets complicated when the two countries don't get along because they can hardly agree on anything.
You are a stupid youngster, you and your comrades are in the store, and you put a pack of chewing gum in your pocket. You are never caught, you and your comrades laugh about it for years. 30 years later, you have a family, a good job, you have never had a conflict. You're 35 years old, and one Saturday morning the police are knocking on your door. The story is over, isn't it? But one of your comrades had mentioned it to someone in the company and now they have taken action against you. You are charged with theft and you have to pay the damage with 35 years of interest or you go to prison for 5 years... all for a pack of gum that you stole at 13...
It is said that when a labor union is on strike, if you continue to do business with that company, you are crossing the picket line and not supporting the workers. For example, I’m told that continuing to buy products from Amazon, which has a labor strike, means that I’m crossing the picket line and not supporting the workers. But won’t my continuing to buy Amazon products put more pressure on Amazon to satisfy the workers’ demands? If I continue to buy products from Amazon and they are so overwhelmed that they can’t package, transport, and deliver the products because the workers are on strike, won’t that show how necessary and important the workers are? I belong to a labor union, but my union is not modeled after this one, so there’s no “picket line” for us to cross, so I don’t understand it completely. Thanks. A: There are different kinds of strikes and different kinds of picket lines. If a worker doesn’t strike, he isn’t supporting his fellow workers who are striking for higher wages. The business is less likely to be concerned with the strike if it can still get enough work done. If a customer shops at the business, he isn’t supporting his fellow customers who are trying to reduce the business’s power.
Animals are covered by the Animal Welfare Act at the state level, not the federal level. There is no requirement for Congress to name the acts they enact in any particular way. Sometimes Congress gives the act it passes a name that is directly connected with the act’s purpose. Sometimes they don’t. The Animal Welfare Act was not meant to regulate the welfare of animals. The Animal Welfare Act came about because pet shops were selling their surplus animals, mostly cats and dogs, to laboratories in the 1960s. That is, if you bought a kitten from a pet shop in the 1960s, then, once that kitten became too old to sell, it would end up in a laboratory. The Animal Welfare Act was meant to stop that. All it does is ban the practice and establish a framework for the inspection of laboratories so that they do not use old pet animals in experiments. It only covers animals that were in common use as pets in the 1960s, so most animals are not covered by it. It is not unusual for things of that nature to be regulated at the state level in the United States. The federal government generally stays away from issues that are of a traditional nature, and animal welfare and animal cruelty are a traditional matter.
This is mainly a way for some politicians to build up prestige and placate a part of the masses. It doesn't really make sense, as you have said, but some politicians won support by promising to keep people safe from dangerous sexual predators, and by keeping a close eye on convicted sexual offenders. In short, the reason is 'politics'.
To be clear, it is not a ban; they are only so tightened that it is as good as a ban. In the case of the United States, after the Court case, the States were given the opportunity to impose restrictions on abortions, which they called reasonable. Now the Texas State Legislature has passed the strictest abortion bill in recent memory. Abortions after six weeks are practically banned, which means that women, by the time they learn they are pregnant, will be too far gone for an abortion. Until now, the Supreme Court has rejected disproportionately restrictive laws. But on Tuesday, a majority of 5 to 4 rejected an emergency request for an injunction, which means that the law goes into effect until the end of the trial. So, for now, abortion is banned in Texas in every important respect.
Baseball is a sport where the umpires have a lot of power to call the game based on their judgment, more than in any other sport. For example, in a game that is 1-1 and the bases are loaded, if an umpire strikes out on a close pitch, it can completely change the outcome of a game. But in the NBA, a ref might call (or not call) a foul, and that foul may make a difference of 2 or 3 points in a 102–99 game. That foul doesn’t have as much impact on the outcome of the game. In football, when a ref misses a call, in many cases, the coach has an opportunity to challenge the call by using instant replay. But in MLB, many judgment calls, such as balls and strikes, cannot be reviewed by instant replay. Since the umpires’ judgment has so much influence on the outcome of the game, and there aren’t as many opportunities for the coaches to appeal, there are more arguments.
Wouldn't it be fairly easy for, say, the police to find the interviewer and question him for the names of the criminals? Well, any intelligent interviewer would simply reply: “Please direct all inquiries to the production company’s legal department,” and the legal department would then reply to the police: “We respectfully decline to answer any further questions.” In the U.S. (and in many other countries as well) it is impossible to be forced to provide information to the police.
Yes, the defendant can invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, but if the defendant has chosen to testify on behalf of the defense, he or she must also answer the cross-examination of the prosecution. It’s all or nothing, either the defendant testifies for the defense or for the prosecution. The prosecution has the right to cross-examine any witness the defense calls.
It is not the DEA that regulates the drug schedules, but the Health and Human Services (HHS). The DEA is an enforcement agency and has no say in the matter. The last time the list was revised and reviewed was during the Reagan administration. This is why there is so much confusion, because it is political, not scientific. Why is it still not legal? Ask the Republican Party. The Conservative Party views pot as a gateway drug to harder drugs because of their political God, Ronald Regan.
Because even though the two are at odds with each other, they may turn on the officer in order to protect each other.
Roe V Wade is a case in which the Supreme Court ruled that women in the United States have a fundamental right to abortion, and that states may not limit it to the point where it is actually forbidden. iv There are some people who think that this is just a step towards bringing the matter before the Supreme Court, where there is a conservative majority, and they could therefore impose a ban on all the states.
By “brutally tortured,” you obviously mean the physical beating and mutilation of the body. The human body has an enormous capacity for damage and can survive an incredible amount. If blood loss is minimized and shock is mitigated, a person can survive a frightening amount of time, in my opinion.
decriminalization does not make it legal. Decriminalization makes it not a crime to have it, to use it, but making and selling it is still a crime. Legalization makes it a crime to produce and sell it.
It was discovered that he had fired on the people in self-defense. The prosecutor had not done his job properly.
Because the F Test is a ratio, which has no negative element. F is a ratio of two variances, but there cannot be a negative variance. If we were only concerned about whether the variances are the same, the ratio would simply be 1. Therefore, since we are only interested in whether the ratio is as close as possible to 1, and the F distribution cannot be negative, it would be one-tailed only, since if the ratio is small, it means that the variances are extremely equal. But since the ratio is greater than 0, it means that the variances are unlikely to be the same. Edit: But maybe I'm wrong.
In the simplest terms, it means that the Federal government cannot single out a religion for special treatment or deny that religion such treatment because of its religious nature. This is strictly enforced by the First Amendment and reinforced by the Fourteenth. There is nothing wrong with a member of Congress professing his faith or using his faith as a “guiding principle” in his decision-making. Neither can he be prohibited from voting for a candidate because he or she is a member of a particular faith.
It was not so much that it was his direct fault, as it was a foreseeable consequence of his actions and the general environment of his concerts. In the first place, he had suggested that concert-goers jump the fence, thus causing the attendance to exceed the venue's official capacity. That's important, because venues are carefully (well, in theory) rated by the fire department for the number of people that can safely be admitted. In an overcrowded place, a crowd crush can result, which is hard to explain in a brief Reddit comment, but it is the phenomenon whereby a large group of people behaves as a singular fluid mass and the movement of individuals becomes impossible. That's what killed all those people at the Astrodome. Also, Scott encourages his audiences to "rage," which encourages a culture of disregard for basic safety rules. At the Astrodome, he continued to encourage raging, even after an ambulance was working its way through the crowd. To be fair, ambulances are a common feature at large events, and he probably didn't realize what was happening. I understand that this is not the first time that something of this nature has happened at a Travis Scott concert, just the worst instance, and that many other performers are much more careful about monitoring their crowds. This is why everyone's so mad at him.
It’s exactly as you would expect, although (I can’t quite remember) I think their fingerprints are different. One of them goes and gets arrested and then says that it wasn’t him, it was his twin brother. Then the other one gets a summons to court and he arrives and claims it wasn’t him either, it was his twin. It’s very confusing. A real case I read about: two twin brothers, criminals both, got caught together. It was so confusing in the prison that they transferred one of them to another prison in the next county. At the next hearing, they both appeared before the judge and we all noticed that one of them had been tattooed with a cross right between his eyes, and the verdict was, “A problem solved!” I saw them in court several times after that, but never once did the second brother get a matching tattoo. This is actually of no benefit to them in the long run, since it just prolongs the process. In another case, the twins were sisters, but only one had ever been arrested. When she was arrested, she used her sister’s name and identification. The other twin sister is probably still fighting the good fight to clear her name. But eventually, because the criminal sister was operating in the same area, local police came to understand and believed the twin. What was even more interesting was that the criminal sister always looked dreadful, but the innocent twin was always smartly dressed and presentable. It was so easy to tell them apart that I never met them again, unless it was in the local court. (25 years, Criminal Attorney)
My view is that, for the most part, torture is a game of chance. People will say anything to be tortured less, and if you finally let them go, you’ve turned them into your enemy. I remember a line in Robert Bolt’s A Man for All Seasons. It goes: “Every man has his price... you make him suffer and wait for him to beg for freedom.” The man in question chose to die rather than compromise.
It is unknown. So far it has not been proved that stem cell can cure anything. There are lots of theories that it can cure this and that and so on, but nothing has really been proven yet. For example, I remember I’ve heard that if it is used in spinal cord injuries, then it can heal, but until now, it has not.
- Well, what's the question? It seems to be an explanation in search of a question.
They have a few reasons: Getting the word out. People should know they exist. Showing they’re not just a bunch of gangsters. They’re a serious, organized, semi-professional organization that’s important enough to be interviewed. Showing their human side. This might get sympathy from the public. Keeping leaks to a minimum. Sometimes they’ll take the interviewer to a place that’s not known. They control what gets recorded, and so on.
Most of those who have been caught did it either for fun (psychos with an obsession for power), or because they were insane (mostly religious delusions, “God told me to kill them all”), or because they had a traumatic experience which they projected onto a group of people. E.g. Their mother beat them, so they now kill all women who look like their mother.
We can’t measure intent. Anyone can say, “I didn’t mean to run over that nun,” even if they’d intended to commit murder. We can measure outcome. A nun was run over by a drunk.
The matter is so serious that it requires evidence, and if one puts one in jail before he has enough evidence to convict, he may escape, through some alleged technicality. Also, the large number of suspects, the number of those arrested, the number who were charged and convicted, and those still awaiting trial, have already, or will in future, contribute evidence. And when you have a group of more than 500 people, it takes a lot of time to investigate and disprove their testimony. The situation is even more serious when the persons in question are high-level officials or rich people, who can afford a brilliant lawyer, and when a blunder can end up inciting to more political violence and extremism. Prosecutors, in particular, do not like to demand a charge, and arrest, unless they are absolutely sure they will be able to convict.
Why don't you call the police and ask them?
It’s true that the chambers of a legislature are not a place where free speech reigns. There’s a system of rules called “parliamentary procedure” that governs who gets to speak, when and sometimes, even what they’re allowed to say. The rules vary a bit for each legislature, but there are common principles that apply to all. The Texas House Speaker can set the parliamentary rules as long as he follows the established procedures, and he can set rules about what words can be used and what can’t. There may be a vote required to change the rules, but if the vote passes, it’s official.
it all comes down to the defense’s portrayal of the police as so obviously prejudiced that the jury couldn’t believe the mountain of evidence.
To ensure that he is given a fair trial, that the investigation is conducted according to law, that mitigating circumstances are taken into account in the sentence, etc.
Sometimes the property / house owner must pay out of his own pocket. Generally, case law says that he is not entitled to compensation, because the police were acting to protect the public.
It's unusual. There is a law against cruel and unusual punishment. It is on the famous piece of paper. It is on the paper. Or on a parchment. The fact is that the sweeping would be too gruesome and would cause the cleaning staff to be afflicted with nightmares. Proponents of judicial execution want to at least appear as far from barbarism as possible, so that public support for their barbaric practice will not decrease.
It is illegal to have an open container in the car, regardless of who owns it, because the officer does not know whether it was he or she who was drinking it or not. Being intoxicated as a passenger is not illegal if you are intoxicated with a legal substance, but it does not matter who owns the container, it is illegal for it to be open and in the car.
RULE 2. No questions about politics or law.
Suspension of disbelief is the foundation of all fiction. It is the idea that something is not realistic, not possible at all, but that one ignores it because it is so much fun, interesting, etc. "Suspended in disbelief" is a pun, which means that the author is looking for something that takes him far away, like well-written fantasy with a strong internal consistency.
Church-state separation comes from two clauses in the First Amendment: You cannot establish a national or official religion, which would include designating an existing denomination as the official church, and you cannot restrict anyone’s right to practice their religion. That’s it, pretty much. And Representatives do not have to be atheists.
You see, my love, it's when a man like me, explains something either self-evident or not-obvious, as if a person of a lesser intellect, like a woman, would not be capable of grasping the most basic concepts. And, hun, it can happen without the woman's consent. Many men, such as myself, understand that women don't pick things up as fast as men do and we know that we have to teach them. This is basically when men teach the stupid to be less stupid by being more like the smart ones. Well, hun, you are smarter than the rest of the girls and your ass is FINE!
There are cases where the police wanted to check a phone and the policeman just held it up to his face and the phone unlocked. Whether this is lawful or not is still a matter of debate, but it shows that it is easy to bypass biometric security when the person is there. And if the biometrics are somehow compromised and a replica made, there is no way to change them. I see that u/cherryreddit mentions the fingerprint of Angela Merkal - from now on she can no longer use that finger on anything because the information is compromised and a replica can be made. Compare this with a password that can be changed as soon as it is compromised.
They are. But radio equipment to monitor cell phone use is expensive. And if a correctional budget is already stretched, it is likely that many prisons and jails may not have such equipment.
It all comes down to money. Trials are very expensive, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars, for a single trial. If every accused person in the United States went to trial, the country could not bear the expense. The solution is a plea bargain. If a criminal admits his guilt, agrees to accept a sentence, and avoids a trial, some justice is served, and taxpayers do not have to pay as much. It is not a perfect solution, but like most things in life, it all comes down to money.
yes. Will they? No. They will just add your case to the list.
The jury is responsible for deciding which of the charges the accused is guilty of, if any, and the judge then determines the severity of the sentence on that basis. Then if the jury says, for instance, that a man is not guilty of a thousand charges, the judge cannot sentence him to anything. If, however, the jury acquits him of all charges, then the judge may still punish him as the law prescribes.
The government doesn’t. It’s the media companies that spend their time and resources hunting down those who pirate their stuff, not the government.
Occam's razor is a sort of statistical rule: the fewer assumptions you make, the more probable your explanation is. Let's say you have an uncle who's a known alcoholic, who also spends a lot of money on games of chance when he's drunk, and he also lies when he's drunk to hide it. He comes to your house stinking of alcohol and asks for money; he says that he lost his wallet and fell into a pool of liquor. Is this possible? Sure, but if you assume that his wallet was stolen, you're assuming that he's telling the truth, and you're assuming that he fell into a pool of liquor. These are unrelated assumptions. They're all very unlikely. Or maybe he just had a relapse. In that case, the only assumption is that he had a relapse; everything else follows from that assumption. That explanation is therefore more probable.
Police are the local police and they work only within the jurisdiction of their own city. The sworn officers of the FBI are sworn officers of the United States of America. The sworn officers of the CIA work within the jurisdiction of the State. CIA is the foreign intelligence service (i.e. the spies). They operate outside the U.S.
they don't get to jail you if they think you're lying. Your disability isn't defined by your application. You have to show proof—a doctor's examination and test results—to prove it.
It's just a tradition, it's a sign of respect to the judge, but it also has the effect of drawing attention to the proceedings and quieting down the courtroom.
Law is a man-made rule. Laws are regulated by the government and the police. Before the government was established, people would sit together and declare a law, such as that theft is not good. Then they will decide the punishment for theft. If someone tries to steal, then all the people will punish him and the incentive is there for him not to steal.
A good plot twist hides the important bits in the little details. For example, on the first day the narrator walks a path and takes 10 minutes. The next day they start the walk at three o'clock, and make it to a three-thirty tea at the end of the path just in time. They've hidden the fact that the narrator did something in that twenty minutes, and you don't see it, without you noticing it. If you've found out what happened in that twenty minutes, you'll be able to see it, because now you know to look for it. A bad plot twist just comes out of the blue and is a deus ex machina.
One has to keep some sort of records for big operations or for particular crimes that are well planned and investigated. One could leave some sort of false trail of documentation that would somehow cast doubt on everything or would somehow support a later claim, but you’d have to know the police procedure and be clever enough to think that many moves ahead, and most criminals aren’t as clever as they may seem. It takes a lack of sympathy and emotional intelligence to harm others. They usually don’t have the wits to think of something that would get them out of trouble and yet leave no trail of documentation or other clues. If they did, they’d be made into a movie.
I really doubt that it could be described without some bias. But here is the essence of it. During rioting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, one of Rittenhouse’s friends was asked to keep an eye on a local business so it wouldn’t be vandalized, and Rittenhouse was called in to offer security and medical help, if necessary. While on a night shift, he was sent to another business to put out a fire and had some kind of altercation with a Joshua Zaminski and a Joseph Rosenbaum. Zaminski fired a shot in the air, Rosenbaum seized the rifle, and Rittenhouse fired four shots, hitting Rosenbaum, killing him. A crowd gathered and started chasing Rittenhouse, who fled and wanted to turn himself in to the police. He fell while running and was kicked in the head by an unidentified assailant. He was also hit on the head with a skateboard by Anthony Huber. Huber also tried to take the rifle away from him, but Rittenhouse fired again, hitting and killing Huber. As he got up, a Mr. Grosskreutz approached him. He aimed the rifle at him but didn’t fire because Grosskreutz had his hands up. Then Grosskreutz aimed a handgun at him, but he fired first and hit him in the arm. Then he fled the scene and wanted to turn himself in. The Kenosha police didn’t want to arrest him, so he left and turned himself in to the Antioch police the next morning. Basically, the state charged him with two counts of murder for the two men he killed, attempted murder for the one he wounded, negligent homicide for the one he wounded, illegal possession of a weapon by a minor, and breaking curfew. These are the things I remember most clearly. He has argued that he acted in self-defense. So, basically, the trial is to determine whether he is guilty or not guilty of these charges.
The rules say that Senators can debate for an unlimited amount of time, or to an unlimited amount of logic. The Senate is open for a limited period of time, so if there’s a filibuster, then nothing else gets done. Imagine going to a restaurant that is only open for a limited time, and instead of eating, you spend your time debating the merits of using a fork or chopsticks. You leave hungry, and no one cares about forks or chopsticks. So if a filibuster takes place, what are they going to do about it? In the past, some Senators have read from the Bible, phone books, and Dr. Seuss books.
It depends on the distance specified in the order and on what side of it you are. If you are in a building with more than one store and you have business in one of them and not with the person you are supposed to stay away from, then you should be fine. But if you are in a place like a Walmart or a bar, a restaurant or a nightclub, you have to leave the place because there is a danger that you will violate the order. If the victim went to the trouble of getting a restraining order and the court granted it, it would be in your best interest to leave. In essence, you must follow the spirit of the law and stay away from the victim as much as possible. Better to leave than to go to jail.
“You affirm to the best of your knowledge that the testimony you are about to give... ” and the person has to raise his hand.
To find the best answer, consult a lawyer. The law on this subject is different in every town, let alone every state, country, or other division of sovereignty. But generally, if you are named on the lease you are equally responsible for the debt. If you should contact the creditor and explain your position, he might agree to some arrangement with you, especially if you can get the other person to pay all or part of the debt. But generally the written lease is the important thing, and oral agreements have little legal value. Depending on the state of his business affairs, he may have more obligation than you. But the proper procedure is to contact a lawyer. He knows the law, knows what your obligations are, and may know of legal means to enforce them. This is particularly to your advantage if you have a lawyer and he does not. But getting a lawyer doesn't mean you don't have to pay anything. It only means you have someone to help you who is more likely to understand your legal rights.
Most modern societies have abolished the death penalty, because it’s possible to convict someone wrongly, and if they’re executed, they can’t be un-executed. In the few countries that still have the death penalty, they have to be convicted twice, because it is very possible that the state will kill an innocent person.
Keep in mind that I am not a legal scholar and that this is just a piece based on the facts of the trial. Rittenhouse is a 17-year-old kid from Illinois. I forget what city, but it is fairly close to the IL-Wisconsin border. He’s worked in Kenosha, and he has friends and family in Kenosha. He has said that he gave his friend, Dominic Black, money to buy an AR-15. On the 25th, Black gave him the rifle. The gun never left the state of Wisconsin, and it was never in Rittenhouse’s possession unless Black was present. Rittenhouse was not a trained EMT but was an ambulance cadet for his local fire department and had some EMT and medical experience. He and some friends went to Kenosha to essentially help the community after they saw the destruction that happened the night before because of the rioting following the shooting of Jacob B., the Kenosha 12, in the streets. An owner of a used car lot called Car Source asked friends, including Rittenhouse and his friends, to help protect his business after the cars at a different lot were set on fire. The friends agreed and spent most of their time at that lot. During the day Rittenhouse strapped his rifle to his body so that he wouldn’t have to set it down or worry about someone taking it while he was tending to an injured person or using a fire extinguisher. Later, police essentially cleared them out of the Car Source. During the night, Rittenhouse and his friends put out fires in dumpsters and tended to minor injuries. A man named Rosenbaum allegedly got very aggressive with Rittenhouse and his friends. He allegedly made threats to Rittenhouse. One of the threats was something like “If I ever catch you alone, I’m going to kill you.” He also yelled “shoot me, n—a, shoot me, n—a!” At other similarly armed men. Rosenbaum also became angry and aggressive when one of the dumpster fires was extinguished. Later, Rittenhouse thinks he’s walking with a friend, but then he loses him, so he is alone. It’s believed that Rosenbaum is chasing him. He is screaming “f— you” at him and throwing what may have been an empty plastic bag at him. Suddenly, someone shoots two rounds into the air. Without knowing who it is, Rittenhouse turns and confronts Rosenbaum, who is now running at him, and Rittenhouse points his rifle at Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum keeps running. Rittenhouse runs, and then ends up in a little alleyway between parked cars and some protesters. In this area, Rittenhouse turns around and Rosenbaum lunges at him and grabs at his rifle. Then Rittenhouse fires four shots in rapid succession. These shots killed Rosenbaum. You may have heard that Rosenbaum was shot in the back. Although that is technically true, it’s also misleading. The bullet entered his back at an angle and continued down his body, so it looked like it was shot from above. It went in that way because Rosenbaum was lying on his back as he was lunging at Rittenhouse, so his body was lower than the rifle when the bullet was fired. I hope that makes sense. Rittenhouse stays there for a second or two and calls his friend Black to tell him that he shot someone because he had to. He has to end the call because a crowd of people are now chasing him, throwing rocks at him, and threatening him. Then Rittenhouse runs toward the police, planning to turn himself in. He is chased down the street by a crowd of angry, aggressive, threatening people, and in that pursuit he falls down because he has a headache because he was running and because a rock hit him in the head. When he is down, an unknown man kicks him in the face. As he’s being kicked, Rittenhouse fires two shots at the man. The man dodges the shots and runs away. Soon after that, Rittenhouse is hit in the back of the neck/upper back by a skateboard wielded by a man named Huber. After that Huber essentially runs over the fallen Rittenhouse, and grabs his rifle. Rittenhouse fires one shot into his chest as Huber is on top of him, and it kills Huber. At the same time, another man named Grosskreutz starts chasing Rittenhouse, and he has a handgun. He comes about three to four feet from Rittenhouse when he sees the shot Rittenhouse just fired at Huber. He stops and raises his hands, and he still has his handgun in his hand. After Rittenhouse has shot at Huber, he immediately notices him and points his rifle at him, which is why he raises his hands. I believe, based on the video, that after Grosskreutz stops and raises his hands, Rittenhouse begins to lower his rifle. Grosskreutz said that Rittenhouse “reracked” the rifle. I don’t think that happened, and I think the videos prove it. After Rittenhouse begins to lower his rifle, Grosskreutz (according to his own testimony and admissions) lunges at him and points his handgun at Rittenhouse’s head. Rittenhouse is quick enough to shoot him before Grosskreutz can get a good shot off at him. The bullet hits Grosskreutz in the bicep, causing severe injuries to his arm. He runs away and gets help, and he’s still alive to tell the story. It is important to note (and I’ll highlight this later) that Grosskreutz admits that he didn’t get shot until he dropped his hands, ran at Rittenhouse, and pointed his handgun at him. Rittenhouse then gets up and runs toward the police, putting his hands up as he runs, intending to turn himself in. He’s met by an officer in a squad car, who orders Rittenhouse to back up, sprays him with pepper spray, and sends him home. So Rittenhouse goes home to Illinois and tells his mother what happened, and his mother takes him to his local police station to turn himself in. They get there less than an hour after the shooting. This is the big thing that I mean when I say that this case is very important to the defense of self-defense because it could become a legal precedent.
In the United States, the main reason for criminalizing weed was so that it would be easier to arrest blacks and those who resisted society—mainly the hippies and other radicals—who were much more likely to smoke weed than cigarettes. You couldn’t make it illegal to be a hippie or a black person, but you could make it illegal to smoke weed, so people in those communities could be arrested. In the same way, the general knowledge that tobacco was bad for you was not common until after the majority of the population was already smoking tobacco. People didn’t want to ban something they were already addicted to.
That’s not actually the law, but if two people go to court about ownership of an object, the one who is in possession of it only has to say, “I’ve always had it,” and the other person has to prove that he truly did own it, that his object was the same object as the one in possession, and that it illegally came into possession of the other person. But unless there is really strong evidence—invoices, serial numbers, witness statements, security camera, etc.—the court will assume that the owner’s claim is valid. Unless the other person has strong evidence (invoices, security camera tape, etc. ), the one who is not in possession of it has a hard time meeting his burden of proof. If it’s just a matter of one claiming to have stolen something, the possessor is the winner by default.
If they would all leave, they would be the sovereign and glorious lord of a piece of unused earth. Dictatorships need both a ruling and a subordinate class. The subordinate class is exploited so as to enrich the ruling class and secure their devotion to the cause. If no one was left to work, it would collapse immediately. That's why the guards in North Korea and East Germany guard their side of the border, not the enemy's.
- Age of consent is simply the age from which one can make decisions. That is, people under age of consent are not able to make decisions. In my country, it would be 16 for an 18-year-old. It may be different in other countries.
There are two types of gas chambers, the poisonous gas chamber and the asphyxiating gas chamber. But in general gas chambers are very complex and unreliable, regardless of the type of gas used. In the United States, there have been only 11 executions by gas chamber since 1976.
Some people think that everything that is not permitted is a crime. That's not so. Crimes are specifically actions that lead to a prison sentence. A speeding ticket is what we could call a "civil infraction", for which there is no punishment other than a fine. So, for example, possession of hashish is taken. Then decriminalisation turns it from a possible arrest into a notice.
Because it doesn't exist. A polygraph measures a number of physiological indicators, such as pulse and blood pressure, and is supposed to be able to detect lies... but it doesn't. It is basically used as a tactic to get a confession. See this Adam Ruins Everything.
They can't under the law, it's called lawyer-client privilege. It protects all communication between a lawyer and his client from being divulged without the client's permission. The privilege belongs to the client and not to the lawyer. In other words, if you were to send your lawyer a letter detailing all your crimes so that he can advise you, he wouldn't be able to snitch on you without your permission.
What color was your rear when you were pulled over?
Self-representation may... - lack of knowledge, experience, vision - lack of cool objectivity about their own case - loss of objectivity, misplaced trust - clumsiness - distractions and so on.
Last Week Tonight with John Oliver has a great little segment on this. But here’s the TL;DW: When a person is accused of a crime, the state is required to ensure a fair trial, where the defendant is guaranteed the right to a jury of their peers, and the process of due process and all that. With civil asset forfeiture, the government is charging your property with a crime. Because property is not a person, the government can pull all kinds of legal shenanigans.
The law, instead of outright banning abortion after six weeks, allows any resident of the state who has no “interest” in the abortion to sue the doctor or the clinic where the abortion took place. In this way, it is not the government that forbids abortion, but random citizens, and therefore Roe vs. Wade is not applied. This is obviously outlandish sophistry, and it is currently being challenged in the courts. As far as I know, no decision has yet been made.
The FDA’s responsibility is to protect public health by making sure food and drugs are safe to consume. The CDC’s responsibility is disease prevention and research. The differences between them are substantial, and there’s little in their missions that even resemble each other.
Libel. If you say that this is Case X and that Person Y said or did something Z, then if Person Y didn't say or do it, they can sue you for slander. So they need to make it clear in the beginning that they're not saying that Person Y said or did something Z. Often these shows are inspired by things that happened, or try to get into the idea behind a case more (like the O.J. thing where the killer writes a book about it after they're acquitted), but they don't follow the real details of a case as they don't want to become a true crime show.
It is an English word. Under the British system of parliamentary democracy, before there is a general election, the Parliament has to be dissolved, that is, the Queen or the governor general dismisses all members of parliament. Not until the Prime Minister (in recent times, usually the Prime Minister) gives up, the Queen or the governor general will dismiss all members of parliament. Then, if there is a general election, the members of parliament dismissed by the Queen or the governor general may stand for election again, or else there will be new elections. This whole procedure is more of a matter of ceremony. If you ask how the country can still exist without the current members of parliament, in fact, most of the government is run by departments, and the departments have been unchanged for a long time. Also, since the parliament only meets once every two or three months, so even if the parliament is dissolved, it will probably not have much effect on the running of the country. Even after the election, the parliament will probably not meet again until two or three weeks later. So when we say that the parliament has been dissolved, it is really only the first step of the election.
He was convicted of felony murder. If you are in the middle of a felony and someone dies in the course of that felony, you are guilty of the crime of felony murder, no matter how you didn't mean to kill.
Pleading not guilty is mostly just a formality. A lot of the legal stuff (like a possible plea bargain) can't happen until the first hearing, and that's usually where the plea happens. Not to mention the limits the law places on the State. If they obtain their evidence in an illegal manner, the accused has a right to prevent it from being used in court. It is not enough for the State to know that a person is guilty, they have to prove it on legally established procedures.
They do it in case the earlier sentences are reversed later on. So if you go and murder three people, and you’re convicted, you could get three life sentences... but then, if it so happens, an appeals court says: ‘Actually, the case for the first murder was flawed, so we’re setting that one aside’. So without the other two life sentences, you would be freed. But as it is, you can stay in prison and serve your second life sentence instead, and there’s no need to re-try you for the first.
Editor, hi. It's not actually a good idea to do this unless it's relevant to the story - e.g. if the crime is racially motivated, or if a suspect is still being sought. Whether race is a story is often a controversial issue. Also, there is a debate about how to handle the coverage of crime at the moment. Many newspapers do not publish police releases about arrests for minor crimes, especially before a conviction.
No. Isn't there some requirement to remove the firing pin from an assault rifle to cross state lines? It is legal for an underaged kid to travel between states with an assault rifle. He lived in a city divided by the Illinois-Wisconsin state line. The incident site was about 20 minutes from his house and he had a part time job at a convenience store in the area. Is there a video of the incident? Plenty. I'm clueless. Help me out. The night before the incident, there was a riot in Kenosha and the local car dealer got robbed and beat up pretty bad. The next night, the car dealer's family asked a family friend to come to help clean up and secure the car lot. This family friend happened to be a friend of Rittenhouse and asked him to help as well. When Rittenhouse arrived at the car lot, he got surrounded by rioters. One of them, a convicted nine time child molester, with a history of serious mental illness, who had been released from a psych ward that morning, rushed towards Rittenhouse and tried to take his gun. Rittenhouse shot him. A mob of rioters chased him for a few blocks, he got knocked down by another rioter with a violent history, and while he was down a third rioter beat him with a skateboard. The third rioter then grabbed his gun, whereupon Rittenhouse shot him. A fourth rioter was holding a Glock. Rittenhouse aimed his gun at the fourth rioter, who raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. When Rittenhouse lowered his gun, the fourth rioter pointed the Glock at him. At which point Rittenhouse shot him. All this was caught on camera and is all over the internet. It is one of the clearest self defense cases in the history of the United States. In normal times the prosecutor who brought the case would be disbarred. It is still possible he will be.
The defendant will declare bankruptcy, and the defendant’s possessions will be sold to pay the plaintiff. After that, the debtor will be declared insolvent and the debtor’s assets will be confiscated.
The police is a cost, and people say we should allocate that cost to another area of government that can do more with it. It ranges from a request for less money, to a complete abolition of police, to a request for abolishing police altogether. Many times it is asked that the money be diverted to social service so that there will be less need for police, such as help with mental health and homelessness.
Why is the law so clear? Because the law is very clear and simple: every male citizen between the ages of 18 and 25 must register for selective service. The function of selective service is not to recruit people directly, but to have a registry, a list of people who could be called up to the screening center if there were a serious need for more people in the military. Registering for selective service does not imply that one is in the military, let alone that one is qualified to serve. You say “I couldn’t” get past a phone interview with a recruiter, which implies that you haven’t actually tried. In the military, there are all sorts of exemptions, so although on paper your “minor health screening conditions” might disqualify you, they don’t necessarily have to in reality.
yes, a monetary fine and imprisonment until you do so. In civil cases they can also find an adverse inference. It is, moreover, taken for granted that if you do not hand over the documents, the judge and the jury can assume that they prove your guilt.
They kept files indexed by various fingerprint characteristics and checked them by hand. A blind search for fingerprints without any additional information would be a matter for expert teams to study them individually. If they had a suspect list or any other information, this could help them confirm or rule out suspects. But it was not a search system to find a specific fingerprint in a million.
Example: Company A is selling its services to Company B outside the permitted area. The company A is subject to punitive action. On the other hand, if an employee of company A sells services to Company B outside the permitted area (which is prohibited by the company A’s internal policy), the employee is guilty of selling services in violation of the internal policy of the company A. Company A is not subject to punitive action.
The same way that the last officially declared war was World War Two. It gets too messy for the senate to get involved, so the president uses executive orders to effectively declare war and move troops without officially involving Congress.
A member’s job is to draft or sponsor bills. These bills are then studied by the appropriate subcommittee. This group is the first to see the bill and can either kill it off or pass it on to the main body of Congress for a vote. The censure means that Gosar is no longer able to influence which bills get debated and what issues are discussed in Congress. It also carries a certain degree of shame, but this is a luxury the Republicans have outgrown. In fact, Gosar has already repeated the appearance on the web of the very recording that got him censured. He’ll be raising money on it and making money.
However, it doesn't enhance the players performance, it enhances the after party. The only reason THC is banned is because it's still illegal federally and in some states.
It means that the person knows what he is doing, but is unable to stop himself. The drug addict was wrong to get into the habit of taking the drug, and isn’t thinking straight; but the drug dealer knows very well what he is doing and that he is harming people, but still does it. It is... oversimplified.
Labor unions were an excellent place to extort bribes: You could mobilize a lot of people all at once—instant influence—plus the unions already had an established structure, they usually had offices, and they often had lawyers on retainer. You could extort “protection money” from shopkeepers because you control the union and you can pull the workers off the job or break off all labor negotiations at once. Or you’re building a house or a block of flats and suddenly the union says, “Well, the concrete we were supposed to deliver today may have to wait till next week because your union dues are late.”
What if one caught someone in the act of murder with a knife at his throat? One would like to think that he would be more inclined to give up and not kill, if the punishment were the same either way. In addition, there is a principle that the punishment must be proportionate to the crime, the punishment must roughly correspond to the extent of the harm caused. Since a murder is worse than an attempted murder, the punishment must also be less.
He did something, was accused of certain crimes and is going to use the excuse of self-defense. Both sides will present evidence to the jury in a process controlled by an impartial, professional judge. The jury will make a decision and either party can appeal. It will take two to five years to finish, but it's a complicated procedure to make sure it's fair.
They can't be admitted as evidence. They're just a fear tactic, and the only one (in the U.S.). And the only thing that makes them work is the idea that they're accurate.
It depends on the crime. One of my friend’s did not know that it was a crime to cut her own hair without the express permission of her father or husband. No, she was not arrested. Even most of the local police don’t know about this law.
There should be consistency, a uniform application of the law. So, if a precedent has been established, has been pondered over and decided, and has been subjected to time and objections, it is an important precedent for future guidance in similar cases.
It is too easy to get emotionally involved in your own case and then make bad decisions. Having a lawyer who is emotionally detached from the case should lead to better legal decisions.
It depends on the circumstances and the charges. If it's just a ticket for something on the road, the judge tells you to pay a certain fine, and that's it. If it's a criminal case, the judge may set a different hearing date for the punishment. And then he continues with the next trial.
the constitution forbids ex post facto laws. This means that the government is not allowed to change the law retrospectively. Otherwise the government, if it did not like you, for example because you are a candidate of the opposition party, could criminalise what you have already done, and you could then be arrested for it. It is legally only valid that something was a crime at the time it was done. It is true that the state governor or the president of the republic sometimes pardons people who are in prison for what is no longer a crime, but pardoning is an act of the executive, not of the legislature. And indeed, a pardon is a confession of guilt, so one cannot be pardoned for something that was not a crime.
Most laws are like this: ‘It seemed like a good idea at the time.’1 There’s no rule that says laws must be logically constructed, and many of them are historically conditioned responses. To counteract the constant outflow of citizens who die, states have two strategies: to encourage people to have babies or to encourage them to immigrate. The control of citizens’ procreation is a very difficult and complex business, and it has a long history of ending in disaster. That leaves only the encouragement of emigration as a means of increasing the country’s population. Immigrants are usually younger than citizens, and if they can get in and then have babies, they are doubly useful in increasing the young population. Another advantage. Immigrants may also be skilled workers, and the country they migrate to gets all the benefit of that, without having to pay the costs of educating the immigrant. On the other hand, some immigrants are refugees from failed and desperate states which haven’t provided them with any useful skills. These are the ones who cost more than they contribute, and governments try to reduce the number of such immigrants if there are any more desirable ones available.
Texas, because of the recent Supreme Court decisions that prevents states from banning abortion, they try to find a way around it. Instead of being charged with abortion after six weeks (the time it takes for the embryo to start beating its heart), the state is giving citizens who are not employed by the government (no police officers, no prosecutors, etc.) up to $500 to get rid of a person who is. Thus, these citizens essentially sue people who are engaged in or help to procure abortions, and can receive up to $10,000 for this. This is what people call a bounty on abortion. This is done to discourage abortion without making it illegal.
On several occasions, the Supreme Court has held that “obscenity” is not protected by the First Amendment. For example, in Roth v. United States,1957, in Jacobellis v. Ohio, 1964, and in Miller v. California, 1973.
This is often the result of multiple sentences for multiple crimes. The justice system does not care that a single crime means life imprisonment, and the same is true of others.. It also makes it harder for them to get parole, and a single overturned sentence is not enough to release them, so the case is also less likely to be dissolved by a court, which, in addition, prevents a retrial from happening and a second trial from being taken.
The law on arresting suspects varies from state to state, and the Brooklyn Nine-Nine is one of the least accurate police shows and should never be taken seriously as a comedy by people who have no knowledge of law enforcement. In general, however, it is possible for the police to arrest someone who has been arrested and released.
This is somewhat complicated because it depends on what the judge actually rules. The newspaper doesn’t go into the details, but the ruling could be rather limited—in other words, the law could still be in effect, except for the offending part. But it almost never stops there. The lawyers for the government will appeal any negative ruling. That may then lead to arguments before a higher court. The judge can’t order the law to be rewritten (the separation of powers forbids the judiciary from ordering the legislature to make laws). If the legislature wants to amend the law to address the judge’s objections, that’s entirely up to them.
But you can still be fired if you don't do your job, so if you abuse it and don't do your work, it's going to go badly for you. The idea is to give employees flexibility and freedom, which might make them happier and therefore more productive. And it's also a major perk that can help them recruit talented people at less cost. I don't think it would work in many industries, however.
The prison I work in issues four razors per month to each prisoner. In order to get razors the next month, a razor must be returned. It is forbidden to buy razors and those issued are single-blade razors. If any open razors are found in the cells, it’s a weapons charge.
You’ll have to show me actual cases rather than speculating, if you want a real answer. The phenomenon you describe is really a monster spawned by news reports of complex cases that are grossly misrepresented. In reality, most judges are intelligent people and, as far as I know, other than a few rare cases, ridiculous lawsuits don’t go very far. As far back as I can remember, the fear of lawsuits has been a fad of the day, but I don’t think it has ever been a real problem.
Because they're a bad reason to have a law. "I don't see anything wrong with it" is not a reason to have a law. "This law solves a specific, real, practical problem that exists" is a reason to have a law. So what is the specific, real, practical problem that exists that a voter I.D. law is designed to solve? Also, unless this law does absolutely nothing, the result is that some people who can vote now will not be able to vote after the law passes. It will suppress the votes of some people. Why are you doing that? What will you get out of it?
You’re asking a pretty general question here. It’s not unusual for a piece of software to include the name of the program and the version number in the metadata of the files it creates. In some cases, there may even be an identifying mark that can be tracked back to the license or the machine that the program was run on. Even if this metadata isn’t there or has been deleted, it’s still possible to find certain characteristics of the software. For example, different CAD programs create different toolpaths, and it may be possible to identify those toolpaths in the manufactured product. Sometimes these identifying characteristics are even added on purpose, so that it’s easier to find and track down pirates. But a lot of it depends on what the specific application creates and what you do with it.
Networks and devices can only handle so much traffic. At this point, the system will start to refuse incoming requests, or the system will be slowed down to the point that it no longer functions. A DDoS attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack, in which the compromised computers send a flood of requests to another device. If you have a bot army, i.e. a large number of compromised machines, then you can effectively DDoS a network or device.
Usually by experience. If you’ve seen the same case or a similar one thirty times before, you’re more familiar with the relevant law and/or ways it can be bent or turned to your advantage. Or, in the case of a jury trial, what sort of perspective can help convince the jury that perhaps the accused did not commit the crime. Similarly, reducing the sentence because the accused obviously didn’t INTEND to do anything illegal, it was just a very unfortunate accident. That’s why there are specialized lawyers: divorce lawyers, insurance lawyers, criminal lawyers, tax lawyers. They know their field.
You can if you have called the police. If you are being attacked, you can defend yourself. A "sudden counter-attack" is a tricky thing.
I’m no lawyer, but if I remember correctly, 2nd degree murder is a deliberate murder with a pre-existing motive, but not a premeditated one. It’s more of a crime of opportunity. For example, you meet your long-time enemy and you have a weapon lying around. Voluntary manslaughter is when you can take measures to avoid killing someone, but you deliberately decide not to take them, such as not hitting a pedestrian or breaking in time.
When you talk to the police, everything you say can be used against you in court, especially people who don't know the rules of the court. So the most useful thing is to say nothing until you have a chance to talk to a lawyer and discuss exactly what information to reveal and how to say it. The fifth amendment protects your right to refuse to answer when you are under arrest and not to testify against yourself in court. It is important to note that this only protects you from self-incrimination, but you can still be summoned to testify against others.
Starting with civil law, this law governs the relations between members of the community (private citizens, business corporations, etc.). For instance, if your landlord takes you to court because you don’t pay your rent, he is using civil law to get his money. The victim must usually sue the culprit in order to begin proceedings. If the landlord doesn’t mind if you don’t pay your rent for six months, the State won’t come to his rescue and say, “Hey, this man owes you six months’ rent—the State will take him to court for you!” Criminal law usually deals with more serious crimes, such as murder, theft, damage to property, and assault. If you commit these crimes, the State will initiate proceedings against you, and you may face jail time and fines.
Because if the robber does not hear the alarm, he might take your valuables and go before the police arrives. The primary purpose of a home alarm system is not to arrest the burglar, but to prevent your valuables from being stolen, and the most effective way to prevent theft is to frighten the burglar before he has a chance to take anything.
A psychologist is a mental health professional who specializes in testing and diagnosing mental health issues and disorders. They can be counselors, but not necessarily. They are the ones who have you fill out some tests to figure out what's wrong with you. Counselors treat mental health issues and disorders through therapy and also provide general mental health care that may not necessarily address disorders. They are the ones that you talk to and that help you work through your problems. Social workers overlap with counselors and also can provide therapy and counseling, but they are more concerned with helping their patients and their families with resources and assistance. Social workers help their patients apply for benefits like food stamps, find them resources like child care and other forms of help, and generally assist their patients with their needs. These three are like three intersecting circles on a Venn diagram. There's a lot of overlap, but there are still unique differences between them. I am currently in school to get my degree in social work. I will be able to provide some therapy and counseling (less so than a counselor), but I will also be able to help people with what they need. I hope this helps!
This is a custom which, in time-honoured fashion, is meant to imply that justice should be “blind to rank”—that is, not influenced by wealth, rank, position, or power. But I do not myself think that this is a tradition to which we should adhere today.
Because logic has no place in the American legal system. Similarly, if a person is terrified of dogs, they can charge them with attacking the police dog.
If there is a medical issue, they'll call a doctor or nurse to attend to it. Or not. People die in jails from medical emergencies all the time. It's not a high priority for them.
I always thought you had to respond when served with a subpoena. You do. A subpoena is a court order to appear and to bring along something. If the only thing a person can get out of it is a possible fine and possibly up to a year in jail if he is found in contempt of court, why would anyone comply with the subpoena? Generally speaking in Virginia each day a violation of the court-issued subpoena, court order or commission subpoena continues is deemed a separate offense. So for each day the violation continues, you can get an additional year in jail, a fine of up to $2,500 or both.
It’s easy. 1) The law makes it difficult for the police to use their tools. They can’t just surveil everything (at least, in theory). 2) The resources needed to investigate and track leads, etc., are greater than the budget for such tasks. 3) Go analog. Use cash drops, couriers, etc. 4) Bribe the government and local officials. 5) Bury illegal things in legal things. Money laundering, shell companies, offshore accounts, etc. Pay for good lawyers and accountants.
Yes. When a work falls into the public domain it is no longer subject to copyright protection and derivative works can be created without any permission.
You can tell your lawyer anything. You should tell him everything, because he will still defend you. Even if a crime has been committed, it is sometimes not observed in the process, and the indictment becomes invalid for that reason. It is not the task of the defense attorney to prove that you did not do it, but the task of the accusation to prove that you did.
the point is trust, unless you've come up with it yourself, it's very likely that you were told the secret with the assumption that you would keep it to yourself. If your first response is "why shouldn't I blackmail you?" then you shouldn't expect people to tell you anything, even if they need to. It's this kind of attitude that gives credence to the saying "two people can keep a secret, but only if one of them is dead."
Cameras are not the reason why. It’s to reduce the incentive for attorneys to behave badly—saying things because they will be on the evening news, even though the judge has told the jury to ignore them. If you think of the famous Simpson trial, it was a circus, very bad. The journalists, however, need pictures. And, because television is a visual medium, courtroom artists are literally “the least they can do.”
The Alford plea is not an admission of guilt; on the contrary, it is a protest of innocence and an admission that the prosecution has enough evidence to bring a charge and probably a conviction. It is most often used in plea bargaining, to avoid the risk of conviction, while retaining the protestation of innocence.
It depends on the court. If the lawyer can prove he has tried to reach the defendant with reasonable diligence, the court may help him out. For example, he can send his bailiff to deliver the papers, send them by registered mail or nail them to the door. Thus the papers will have been served, even though the defendant may not have actually signed for them. In other words, running away will only postpone your day in court, not cancel it. And if you don't show up in court, there will be a warrant out for your arrest.
Insurers have certain criteria to meet before paying for a procedure, medication, etc. In a preauthorization, they receive information about a case from the doctor’s office. They receive the labs, the meds, and that sort of thing, and if their criteria is met based on the information provided by the doctor, they will approve the procedure, medication, etc.
I watched a bit of Rekieta's livestream on the verdict, he explained it well. If I understood correctly, they're different degrees of severity. Depending on the circumstances, the evidence, the jury, etc., you can, for example, be acquitted of the first two charges of felony murder but found guilty of the third and fourth, but in order to get to that point you need to be charged with each level individually. So if the jury rejects the highest degree, it must decide on the next and so on, until one of them is acquitted, because then it must be acquitted of all the lower ones. But if you're found guilty of the most severe, you're also guilty of the less severe, because they're a less severe version of the more severe.
Because when people can make money from imprisoning people, they will do anything they can to make the maximum profit. If you were to release everyone in prison at the same time, private prisons would lose a lot of money.
innocent until proven guilty is a principle in the legal system, in order to prevent the government from arresting people for alleged crimes, but there is no such principle in the social sphere. The public can have whatever reaction it wants, and there is no law to stop people from having any opinions or boycotting.
Because there are rich people (or many people of modest means) who will pay money for pieces of that animal. And there are many, many poor people who are willing to risk their lives or a long prison sentence for the chance of making a lot of money. The only way to stop poaching is to eradicate poverty and to give everyone a decent enough life so they won't even think of a way to make a lot of money by killing a protected animal. This would be incredibly difficult, since some people always want more. Or to remove the demand for the animal's parts. If all the people in the world stop buying them, then there'll be no reason for anyone to kill for them. Both of these things are incredibly difficult and difficult to do. But until we can do them, poaching will continue.
The idea is that it costs money. Even if the ID itself is free, the process takes time. The documents that are required may cost money as well. The process of obtaining a copy of a birth certificate can take months and has a financial cost. I think the real problem is in places that do not allow water to be handed out to people in line, and in places where there are not enough polling places. In some places, people wait for hours for a polling place.
Can you name any other organization that would give a minor, a minor who is barely an adult, a fifty or a hundred thousand kroner loan that cannot be dissolved in bankruptcy. It does not make any sense that we would lend so much money to a young man without any credit history, whom we don't even trust to rent a car.
Decriminalization —it's not right in the eyes of the police, but the police won't arrest you. Legalization —it's right and there's no legal reason to go against it.
In the United States, there is a principle of inevitable discovery. If the prosecution can prove that a piece of evidence would have been discovered in a legal way in any case, evidence that would otherwise have been ineligible may become eligible. An example is the case of Nix v. Williams,[1] which established the principle in the United States Supreme Court: Williams was an escaped mental patient who in Iowa in 1968 had murdered a ten-year-old child and then fled. Several days later, he gave himself up to the police in another state. During the transport back to the county of origin, he was asked where the corpse was, and he led them to it. He was convicted, but then in 1977 the U.S. Supreme Court found that his right to a lawyer had been violated by the arrest and overturned his conviction. Then at the second trial, the prosecution succeeded in proving that they had been searching in the area in question and would have found the body whether or not they had cooperated with Williams, and on this ground the second trial resulted in a new conviction. The case came back to the Supreme Court in 1984, where the judgment was again confirmed.
First, under U.S. law the prosecution gets only one chance to prove its case against the defendant. If the government bungles it, the defendant is a free man. So the government is induced to build its case and present it properly before it comes to trial. And it’s especially complicated cases that take a long time to get ready. Second, in big cases involving well-to-do defendants or corporations, the defense will sometimes delay the trial to give it time to prepare or just to drag it out. Third, the courts are very busy and it is difficult to get a case to trial quickly, especially if it has to be heard in a higher court.
It's actually a very modern and humane way to die. It's quick and reliable. There were some reports from the executions during the French Revolution that the executed might have survived, but this has been disproved, although the myth still persists. The guillotine was used until 1977, when the capital punishment was abolished in the countries where it was used, but it is still a method that is considered today. The only thing with the guillotine is that it is very bloody and can be disgusting both for those who see it and for those who have to clean up afterwards. But for the person who is executed it is one of the best ways. Other countries have used the long hanging method, which is also instant but not as bloody because the skin is not punctured, which is also more humane. The problem with the long hanging method is that it requires more experience from the executioner, because if the rope or the weight is wrong, it can lead to strangulation or decapitation. And today, only a few people in the world have done the long drop and none of them can be considered experienced. Lethal injection is perhaps the best method, although it is a much longer process than with other methods, which in itself can be considered as cruel. Gas chambers are not as reliable and also take a long time, they are also very dangerous for the executioner and not a very practical way of execution, except for mass executions. Firing squads are very practical and easy for the military, because the equipment is easily available, but it is quite unreliable and it has happened that people have survived for minutes after being shot, maybe just with a shot to the head to end it.
I had a psychology teacher once who explained it to me in this way, and it has always stuck in my mind... Here you have a codependent relationship. Each of the two lines represents one person. They both depend on each other for support and stability. If you take one out, the other will fall. Now, this is a dependent relationship. One person is independent (the vertical line). You can stand on your own two feet, with or without someone else. The other person (the slanted line) is dependent on the other person. If you take the vertical line away, the dependent person will fall. This is an interdependent relationship. Both are independent and stand on their own two feet without each other's help. If you take one out, the other stands by itself. They're linked together in the middle, to show that they respect and support each other, but they're not dependent on each other. (Sorry about the layout, it's from the psychology teacher.)
The main purpose is twofold. Firstly, to make a certain impression on the public. Secondly, so that even if one of the sentences is overturned, the other ones continue to run.
The one phone call is a film myth. It depends on the seriousness of the charge and on how polite you have been with the arresting officers. It can be as many as you wish, but always bear in mind that all telephone conversations can be taped and can be used against you. It is not necessary to call a lawyer at all. Give a name, a firm, a telephone number, or say you want a public defender and they will call for you.
They keep everything locked up until the evildoers have been convicted; it’s evidence. Then they spend the money and destroy the drugs/guns. Sometimes they get recycled for undercover work, but that’s led to so many mistakes in the past that most police departments now destroy everything.
One government practicing espionage on another government is perfectly legal under the laws of the first government. However, if the second government uses it against the first government, it becomes illegal. It is a case where a law applies to that country which is using it against itself, even though the same country is using it against other countries.
Mirrors were extremely expensive, of the order of a theater-house or a luxury car. For this reason alone, the servants were ordered to handle them with special care. And then people believed that the mirror was the door to the next world. Look how many stories feature magic mirrors or journeys through mirrors to the “other side.” An extremely expensive and powerful occult object leads to a lot of fear and superstition.
The government knows to stop sending them social security checks or telling them to appear at a jury trial. Also so that relatives can’t vote in elections under your name.
doctors and other professions are usually paid by you (or indirectly by you through an insurance company). That is a contract, a legal obligation, an exchange of benefits. Breach of that legal contract can be settled by the law. For certain professions (like doctors) the contract is professional promise. There is no such contract with politicians. It’s like the sword of Damocles: it cuts both ways. You don’t want politicians to just sell their right to be elected (they represent you). But then, the only way to punish them is at the ballot box.
The biggest risk in fighting organized crime and terrorism is that you miss a large part of the organization. Even if you manage to capture only part of the leadership, the rest of the organization is likely to try to identify those arrested and kill them or their associates. Since this is always a risk, especially in countries with little stability, special police often prefer to remain anonymous when conducting such operations.
A: Several corporations and other such fictitious organizations are held to have the status of persons in law. If a corporation did not have personhood, it could not be sued (or sued). Contrary to popular belief, the doctrine of corporations as persons did not originate in the Citizens United case, which merely extended the principle to unlimited political contributions.
It usually comes back to the same court. A ruling is made, and then there’s always some dispute, or the mom doesn’t let him take the child every other weekend, or the guy has to pay for everything at school but doesn’t pay for the football team, which she takes as part of the tuition. So they have to come back to the court to make sure that the ruling is carried out. If it’s a government department, it’s still kind of the same. During the Trump administration there have been several cases where a court ruling has been made and then it’s not been followed, so it comes back to the same court, which says, “No, you can’t do that and when I said everything I meant everything.” That’s happened with various departments. One of the best examples is when the court ruled that the Department of Education could not collect on certain debts related to fraudulent schools, and after the injunction Betsy DeVos’s department tried to collect on those debts anyway, so they brought her back to the court, and she was held in contempt of court. They had to pay a fine of $100,000, and if it happened again, they’d be thrown in jail.
Because it is a federal country in which the states have a certain independence from the federal government. It is the same in Germany, where the sixteen states are a federal republic.
In Texas, the number of religious people is still high and religious people believe that life begins at conception. But those of us who are not religious believe that life begins only after birth. I personally think that abortion should be restricted to the first three months, when the unborn baby does not feel any pain. I think this is a reasonable compromise between religious, scientifically illiterate people and non-religious, intelligent people. Greg Abbott is a trash governor, who often makes decisions that go against the public interest. This is nothing more than a dog whistle to try to get support from his voters next time.
You get multiple life sentences so that you can't get out of it if you appeal. If you commit three crimes and get a life sentence for each, then if you appeal and prove your innocence in one of the three cases, you still have two life sentences to get out of. It's a way to make sure that the prisoner doesn't walk free.
It’s this, the US law system. You can sue anyone, for any reason, at any time. Our system is designed to make it easy for the courts to settle these matters. But as you have noticed, yes, you need to have suffered some kind of damage to have *standing* to sue. You can sue anyone for anything, but the court can throw the case out if you lack *standing*. I would assume, therefore, that this law won’t stand, because these citizens will not have *standing*. I’m sure the defense will be that they are suing in defense of (or in other words, vengeance for) the fetus, which is in no position to sue. But since a fetus is not legally a person, the court can’t compensate it in any way. But in the end, it’s up to the voters of Texas, so the state can pass whatever law it likes. The people of the state voted in their legislators, and as long as they don’t infringe on the Constitution (which this law probably does, but that’s another issue), they can do as they wish.
Because Congress passed legislation that allows it. There is no world government that says what countries can and cannot do.
The kingpin act is an act that was enacted in the House of Representatives in 1999. The act gives the President of the United States of America the right to punish drug dealers, their companies, and other third parties that deal with them financially, and impose sanctions on them. The sanctions can include the freezing of their assets in the United States of America. See the ten commandments of the kingpin by Christopher Waller, 1997.
Because the inmates outnumber the guards and what else is to be done with them, to dump them in a super-prison? They are already inside. And although the government may step in, it is only temporary. It does not have the means to keep an entire population under control forever. And in the meantime the gangs know that if they overstep the mark, the government will crack down, and therefore they establish an equilibrium, they operate to such a point that the government does not consider the crackdown worth the trouble.
No. Most of these so-called morality laws are culturally specific. What’s “indecent” in one culture is perfectly decent in another, or even in the same culture at different times. I know for myself that a naughty ankle sticking out from under a lady’s crinoline is guaranteed to turn my head.
How would you go about convincing the jury that you actually found your friend’s bloody shirt in the house you broke into? When the police collect and store evidence, they have a very detailed procedure for keeping track of the chain of custody, which is the mechanism for proving the evidence came from where it did. You can’t prove that just by playing the part of Batman.
A lot of the harmful effects of many drugs are directly caused by the fact that they are illegal. Illegality of drugs results in many people getting criminal records which limit their access to schooling and employment, which often continues the situation which has already led them to use drugs, and drives the drug traffic to criminal organizations, thus drawing them into contact with other criminals, and makes it more difficult for them to receive treatment for drug use and limits the possibilities of treatment. Decriminalizing drugs reduces all these harmful effects, making it easier for those who want help to get it, and reducing the number of people who get formal exclusion by society due to criminal records and therefore start using drugs again because life has gotten even more boring. It also reduces some of the “luster” of drug use, making it more of an illness that people are sick and receive medical treatment for, rather than something that is a thing rebellious and extreme youths do.
Some 8 percent of inmates in federal prisons are in for violent crimes. But 50 percent of inmates in state prisons are there for violent crimes. Also, the federal prisons are better regulated. They’re subject to national oversight rather than just state oversight.
Cosby was tried before, and the prosecutor refused to continue the trial because there was insufficient evidence. This ended the case. Then he could not be prosecuted again, which is double jeopardy, a violation of due process. If you've been prosecuted before for something, you can't be prosecuted again for the same thing. It's a real trade-off, it's bad that errors in prosecution and evidence mean that evil people go free, but it's good that the police can't make up evidence to imprison innocent people.
Emigration is leaving, immigration is coming in. If you live in England but move to Australia, then people in England will say you emigrated, and people in Australia will say you immigrated.
They do. The defendants get paid to appear on the show. They sign a waiver and agree to binding arbitration, so the rulings on the show are enforceable.
As a witness you don't get an automatic death sentence. Did the witness have a pre-existing medical condition? Did the witness have a substance abuse problem? Did the witness like to drive fast? There are any number of ways that people can die. There are natural ways of dying and there are accidental ways of dying.
It is very common for games to show how a Molotov is made. All you need is a bottle of flammable liquid and stuff a rag in it for the wick. That's it. They aren't complicated.
Although no one does it, because if you lose it, you're basically screwed, that's what the law says. If you want to get a job, the boss has to make sure that you are eligible to work, for which you have to provide your ID card, visa, green card, and Social Security Number. To get a social security number, you have to be in a legal working relationship, and to prove it, you have a visa or a green card.
If you get bail, you can wear your own clothes. If you're in jail, you're in jail clothes. It's just another way the system is based on money.
According to an ABC News report from March 12, “Hours before the lawyers were to present their closing arguments, Judge Bruce Schroeder granted a motion by the defense to dismiss the weapons charge. “The defense attorneys, Mark Richards and Corey Chirafisi, pointed to an exception in the law that allows minors to own shotguns and rifles, as long as they have barrels that are not short-barreled.”
Theoretically, you can sue because the law says you can. Lawsuits are about what the law says, not about what’s fair. In practice, the law is shaky, so you’ll probably not get your ten thousand dollars just for being a concerned citizen protecting the sanctity of society against the enemies of the people. However, it is worth it if you have nothing better to do, since lawsuits are a great way to punish the enemies of the people. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Guards) As for HIPPA, it applies only to medical professionals, and if you’re not providing medical services or handling a patient’s health information in your professional capacity, then you can discuss it freely.
The constitution gives Congress the power “to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.” But under the original interpretation of this clause, Congress could not regulate commerce within the borders of a state. This is why the abolishment of slavery and the prohibition of alcohol had to be enacted as amendments. Congress could not regulate these things any other way. But this changed with Wickard v. Filburn.1 * * * * The federal government had set acreage limits on wheat production, to stabilize the price and supply. The farmer, Charles B. Filburn, grew more wheat than his acreage permitted, and was subsequently ordered to pay a fine. He argued that since his wheat had not been sold, it was not commerce, and especially not interstate commerce. The court decided that Filburn’s wheat-growing activity, by reducing the amount of wheat he had to buy for his livestock feed on the open market, reduced national commerce and was therefore within the ambit of the commerce clause. Although the relatively small amount of wheat Filburn had grown would not have affected interstate commerce by itself, the cumulative effects of thousands of other Filburns would have. Consequently, the court ruled that the federal government had the power to regulate Filburn’s production. The expansion of the commerce clause by this case granted Congress an enormous power to regulate the economy, because the court’s reasoning would apply to almost anything. Under this reasoning, Congress could pass a law banning the manufacture and use of drugs such as marijuana and heroin without having to enact an amendment to the constitution. The United States v. Lopez2 ruling of 1943 somewhat curtailed the broad interpretation of the commerce clause, but not by much. In Gonzales v. Raich3 the court upheld the interpretation that growing a small amount of hemp for personal use was interstate commerce.
You can be punished for two crimes simultaneously. The one who has been convicted of a two-year sentence for both robbery and arms possession should, theoretically, be out of prison after two years, the other after four years. But here's something people don't know: in some places they give you an extra hour for each hour you don't disturb them in prison. So, if they didn't disturb them for an hour, they would be credited with an extra hour of imprisonment. So, in the first case, they would be out in one year, and in the second case, in two years. The judges have a series of checkmarks to determine the length of the prison sentence and the way it should be served. If there is a criminal record, that pushes the sentence one way, and if there is no record, it pushes the sentence the other way. Things like employment, family ties, home ownership, etc., can also be taken into consideration in sentencing. In the most serious cases, early release or parole is also possible, after serving a certain percentage of the sentence (it's usually something like 75-85 per cent of the sentence). So, after eight and a half years of a ten-year sentence, for example, it's possible to be released. But in some cases, when there is a criminal record, sentences can be designed so that the sentence is made longer, and the imprisonments are made consecutive, rather than simultaneous. For example, a child abuser who kills his victim by accident, might be sentenced to second degree murder or even only manslaughter. These are punished with much less time than first degree murder. So, for rape, he might only get five years, and for manslaughter, maybe ten. In total, he could get as little as five years (remember, an hour's credit for every hour he serves without trouble), and if the five and ten-year sentences were served simultaneously, he would be out very quickly. Then, if they were served consecutively, he might get as little as 7.5 years and as much as 15 years. A lot of it depends on the criminal record.
It’s not a penalty. It’s just a stoppage. Though the guilty team is somewhat penalized by the fact that the next face-off will be in the offending team’s end of the neutral zone. Offside occurs when a member of the attacking team reaches the offensive zone before the puck. The reason for the rule is to prevent “cherry-picking.” “Cherry-picking” is when a player stays by the opposition goal, waiting for a pass, while the puck is on the other side of the ice. As long as the puck is in the offensive zone before any attacking player, the play is onside and the game is allowed to continue.
If you are thinking of the recent case of the Dutch banker, it’s not murder they are being charged with but felony murder. Felony murder is when someone is killed as a result of an illegal act. Some states define this differently but it’s essentially the same. So if you rob a bank and as a result someone is killed, you can be charged with felony murder even if someone else did the killing. In the Dutch case, the four counts relate to the four robberies and the one death that occurred during each of them. There were two counts of assault, one of kidnapping, and one of criminal attempt to commit a crime. Each of these acts contributed to the death and can be charged as felony murder. Not all the accused were convicted on all the counts. For example, one of them was acquitted of one of the assault charges, and consequently acquitted of the corresponding felony murder charge. (He was convicted of the other three assault charges and the three felony murder charges, however.) In addition to the four counts of felony murder, each of the accused faced a charge of murder for killing that one person.
The judge keeps the process moving and makes sure the rules are followed by both sides. The judge is usually the one to decide the punishment, although in criminal cases the jury’s verdict is generally binding.
I'm not sure why they thought it was a good idea. But if I know anything about the way it's described in books, I don't think anyone who's witnessed one of those executions would be under the impression that it was painless.
Does the fact that I gave them credit remove me from the act of plagiarism? Yes.
it all comes down to jurisdiction. Each of the units you mention is responsible for a particular type of local activities. Each is governed by a governmental body which has the same jurisdiction. There is not much conflict between them because they all operate under laws which are similar in principle if not in detail. For example, if I kill someone in my city, then my city police will investigate and prosecute. The State Police, County Sheriff and FBI have no jurisdiction in these cases and would not be involved in the case unless they were invited by my city police to assist.
She was placed under involuntary conservatorship by a Los Angeles court in 2008. The reasons have never been made public. The court keeps confidential all medical records, including those dealing with mental health. She has to convince the court that she is now capable of acting as a normal adult. Although some of her statements have been made public, the expert opinions, for example psychiatrists, have never been made public. There is no way for the public to find out about the status of this case unless they are directly involved in the court case.
A picket line is what you see standing outside a building, holding up signs, etc., during a strike. A strike is meant to cause some disturbance or stop the work, so crossing the picket line means to ignore or depreciate the strike and enter the building, do your work, etc.
I’m not sure what “already broken” means in this context, but I can’t imagine a society that wouldn’t be broken even more without reintegration. So how would it be better without it? *Typo corrected:
Besides when it's in their jurisdiction, there are times when the lower levels of justice are not equipped to handle them, or they can't be impartial.
There are two kinds of filibustering. The first is called discussion. Everybody has a chance to speak for or against the proposition. There’s no time limit, so in theory you could talk forever, and nobody could vote until you were done. But this is impractical, and it usually works more as a stall than a filibuster. Once the discussion seems to be over, they vote to end the discussion and start voting. It takes 60 votes in the Senate to end the discussion and start voting. This isn’t a vote on the bill itself, it’s a vote to start the voting. If 41 senators agree not to start the voting, it never happens. This is the filibuster that’s usually talked about in the news. It’s not part of the Constitution, and it could be changed if they wanted to.
The original framers of the Constitution didn't think they were necessary because people could simply vote them out. And since a term in Congress was not considered a full-time job back then, they would spend more time at home, on the farm or in their other occupations, so they could know their constituents better. But let's fast-forward to the present day. Congress has gradually granted itself more and more power, and the opportunity to make huge fortunes when they leave. And the ones who are best at their jobs — which is to stay in them — know how to secure things for their constituents so they won't vote them out. And finally, people in power never voluntarily relinquish their power. For there to be term limits, Congress would have to vote itself out of office. You can take that to the bank: There will never, ever, be term limits for Congress.
because prison is enough. Why waste time, money, and energy on bizarre and cruel punishments, when you can just lock people up, forget about them, and then they can’t harm anyone? And who says your morality is better than someone else’s? If you turn evil against evil, does that make you any better? Does it make the crimes of serial killers any less?
It depends on the state. In California, for example, people can be sentenced to death, but the governor still has to give the order to carry out the execution, and he hasn’t done that in 15 years. So, in California, you can be sentenced to death and be placed on death row, but you never get executed, because the governor never gives the order. In other states, the delay is usually due to the kind of appeals that are available. In other cases, you usually can’t introduce new evidence on appeal; you can only challenge the verdict. There is also only one appeal; after that, you can request a “rehearing,” but they are not required to hear them and most courts just put them in a drawer and forget about them. However, most states allow death-penalty cases to introduce new evidence on appeal. The law basically says that if you have some new evidence that might be relevant to your case, the court can stay the execution while it investigates the new evidence, which often takes a year or two, and during that time you can’t be executed. Moreover, the burden of proof for what constitutes new evidence is very low. Basically, any evidence you present that might show your innocence is considered new evidence. Somebody who wasn’t even born at the time of the crime, but now says he saw somebody else commit the murder, that’s new evidence. There’s some DNA evidence that says there’s a 0.01 percent chance that somebody else did it—well, that means that the court has to consider that new evidence before they can execute you. Even if they’ve denied your appeal, you can always file another one, as long as you can find some new evidence. There are many organizations that find new witnesses or pay for new tests to help delay an execution. Usually, they only let you appeal a second time for five or ten years after your conviction, after which they can start the process of carrying out the execution. Some states have shorter deadlines, and some longer; but generally, when you hear about prisoners on death row dying of natural causes, it’s either because they’re in a state like California, where the death penalty exists in name only, or because the state in question has some really long deadline for appealing a death sentence based on new evidence.
The police officer is a police officer. A deputy is a deputy in the city. A sheriff is the sheriff in the county. A corrections officer has no jurisdiction outside the prison where he is employed.
In general, defendants are permitted to change into appropriate clothes for court appearances, because for the very reasons you mentioned—namely, the prejudice that a convict's clothes might cause a jury—but these clothes are not furnished by the state. If the defendant is unable to obtain suitable clothes, he appears as he is.
When two people argue or discuss something, they assume that each is arguing or discussing for the sake of arguing or discussing, that both are playing "fair" and not hiding their intentions. In general, when someone starts arguing in bad faith, it means that he is not playing by the rules or that he is playing dishonestly. If you are arguing something to humiliate the other, it is bad faith. If you are arguing something to "win" an imaginary battle and you do not intend to respect the other's opinions, it is bad faith. If you are intentionally distorting evidence, lying, cheating, avoiding discussion of areas where you are not the strongest, it is bad faith. Questions asked in bad faith also mean the same thing. Usually, we ask a question because we want to know the answer or because we use it as a rhetorical question to draw attention to something, to see the discussion from a different angle. When we ask a question in bad faith, we do not care about the answer, we are not even really interested in the answer, but we just use it as a tool to win, or to use the answer to get into other bad faith arguments.
Because in some cases it’s not entirely the offender’s fault because of the mental illness. Like sometimes he literally cannot understand what’s wrong with what he’s done.
There are some youtubes that tell how to act when police come after a shooting. It depends on the circumstances, but if you're not supposed to have your gun in your hand when they're there for a shooting, you're going to be shot.
All the “Influence and Law enforcement under his payroll” was local, the people who prosecuted him were federal, and he had no influence there. It took a lot to get the feds involved back then.
2nd degree murder means that during the killing of a human being, the thought occurred to you, “I will kill this human being.” This thought does not have to occur before you attack him, but the thought must be there. This is called premeditation. It means that you want to kill him, you want to kill him. 2nd degree murder means that you kill on purpose without thinking. So you don't really have the thought that you will kill him, but you shoot him in the face anyway. This is pure, evil and cold murder. 3rd degree murder means that you do something that will certainly lead to the death of a human being, but you don't necessarily want to kill him. You have to have "the depraved mind and spite" here, but not here. Involuntary manslaughter is very similar to 3rd degree murder, but the difference is the state of mind of the perpetrator, that "depraved mind and spite" is not there. The person who commits involuntary manslaughter does commit an act that unintentionally causes the death of a human being, but not with the depraved mind and spite. Drunk driving is a good example of this. For example, an amusement park ride that does not meet safety standards and is not maintained, so the ride is ruined, and the deaths of the people in the car.
Matt Gaetz isn't convicted yet, let alone sentenced. Until he has been formally charged, there is no legal need for him to be held in custody. After the charge, and before the trial, the judge decides whether the accused will be imprisoned until the trial, or allowed to post bail and thus remain free until the trial. If the accused has few ties to the community and the means to escape, he is more likely to be remanded. More serious crimes also tend to make the accused more likely to be remanded. Generally, between the verdict and the sentence, the convicted will be placed in prison. The sentence will take this time into account when the sentence is imposed (e.g., three months between verdict and sentence, so three months off the final sentence).
If I cut off your arm, it’s mutilation. If a doctor cuts off your arm, it’s just a job. What’s legal or illegal is often determined by the intention with which it’s done and by whom. Also whether it’s done against one’s will.
United States of America is a collection of states with semi-independent governments. Since these governments have the power to make laws, it is possible, and therefore inevitable, that there should be differences in some matters. The age of consent is one of these matters. Age of consent is not a fact. It cannot be measured like the charge on an electron. It is a social convention how old one should be to be able to exercise the sexual faculties. Opinions vary about this, and it even varies from one individual to another.
A logical tool used to alter the truth as it is held by someone else, generally in order to reduce the degree of guilt that person feels towards the excuse-maker because of something he has done or said. As to when it is permissible to use them, that is a moral question, and is, therefore, purely subjective. P.S.—I am very sorry that I have been so vague.
When I was in law school, I worked as a public defender during summers, and career criminals asked if they could plead to the lowest felony instead of the highest misdemeanor. (A felony means you’ll go to prison, a misdemeanor means you’ll be in county jail.) When I asked why they wanted to serve more time, they said that in state prison you can smoke and watch TV, but in county jail you can’t.)
Some choices are completely arbitrary. The “Fire Department of New York” (FDNY) is just as grammatical and clear as the “New York Fire Department” (NYFD). They might have just as well tossed a coin to choose between the two.
Not an informed answer, but at the point where murder is being plotted, they could probably arrest them for the murder.
Exactly, you are not supposed to know, that is the purpose of the confusion. Hence the apparent opacity of the law in favor of the corporations and the wealthy. They are able to pay their lawyer to say what side of the line they are on that only breaks the spirit of the law, not the letter.
It happens sometimes that a very long sentence is given in order to show the extent of the crime. Many times each crime has its own punishment. If you commit ten crimes that carry a sentence of twenty-five years each, then you could get all ten as punishment. The result is that if one of them is reduced or canceled by a formality, you still have nine other crimes to do time for, but you're still out in twenty-five years. If they're consecutive, then you're always long beyond your life.
You got it. Time has passed, many men have come and gone, and there's no one left who cares about the Stallion anymore. The hierarchy of the mafia is so different now that what these men are talking about happened between thirty and forty years ago. Anyone who has something to do with him is either dead or such a powerless old man that no one really cares.
Michael Portillo did some research on this, and he found that one of the main obstacles to the use of painless executions, in this case nitrogen asphyxiation, is that there are influential people who want the death penalty to be painful. Here’s the [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9YgWXKAwNY) article. ED: It is worth noting that there are some states that have opened the possibility.
But not if you include states like Alaska, Mississippi, Wyoming, New Mexico, Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, South Carolina, Arkansas, and Montana. (https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/gun-fatalities-per-capita-by-state)
That’s not what happens in the movie. It’s just for context, for the character or story.
A criminal defense lawyer isn't a lawyer who defends criminals, but a lawyer who defends people from criminal charges. This is either on the basis that the defendant is innocent, or that he or she was justified in committing the crime (self-defense, inadvertence, etc.), or that he or she is not criminally liable because of mental illness or something else.
It is not so much that warning shots are illegal per se in the United States as that they are judged, in general, under the same standards as shots aimed at people. That is to say, if deadly force is not justified, then a warning shot is not permitted. There are good reasons for this strict treatment of warning shots. In the first place, who can say that a warning shot is not simply a missed shot aimed at a person? In the second place, firing a shot at a person in any case puts him in a legitimate fear of death. Often this is the very purpose of the warning shot. So it is still an assault, though not a killing one. In the third place, firing a gun is imprudent, if deadly force is not justified, even if the gun is aimed in a completely harmless direction. People can still be injured by stray bullets, or by those they shoot in self-defense.
Because a lie detector is a pseudo-science, so unreliable that its inventor regrets having invented it.
The jurors cannot generally ask a question directly. Some judges will allow the jurors to write down a question, which is then passed on to the judge, who (sometimes with the help of the lawyers) will decide whether the question is appropriate and will permit it to be asked. This is partly tradition and partly to eliminate bias. If the jury can influence the process, that creates all kinds of problems. There have been arguments that allowing the jurors to cross-examine witnesses directly would raise Fifth Amendment issues.
I suspect that in the United States these books are sold at a higher price because the booksellers are taking advantage of the system whereby students take out huge loans. I think it’s because they lend so much to the students that they can charge more and charge it as being paid for by the bank.
The people who have taken the trouble to acquire a license to carry a concealed weapon are probably not the problem. People who haven’t done the work are, and are breaking the law, and are probably many others as well.
A certain property belongs to you, and you decide to let people use it (and under what conditions) or give it away for free or not at all. All rights reserved is the equivalent of "don't give it away in any form," but it applies to intellectual property instead of physical property. (e.g., Creative Commons) or "public domain" (giving it away for free and without any conditions) are the alternatives.
It is not illegal. The casinos have the right to refuse to play with you, and they do, but they can’t discriminate based on class, and if they suspect you of counting cards, they can ask you to leave.
The weapon is thrown away to escape the responsibility. If the police find out that a person has been killed with a certain type of gun, and they find that this gun is in your possession, it's an important clue for them to catch the criminal and take action. If the gun is found, he can say, "It was stolen from me a month ago, and I haven't seen it yet." If the gun is found in a lake bed, it is reasonable to deny it; if it is found in the drawer of the closet, it is not reasonable to deny it.
Because then they would never give any information. Read a deposition and see the number of times it’s necessary to say “I don’t remember” and “I have no knowledge of” to avoid perjury. A press conference of that kind would be useless to everybody. Perjury is a serious crime that everyone wants to avoid, so putting people under oath reduces the amount of information they’ll share because they fear a lukewarm statement might be taken as the truth. It’s actually against the whole purpose of a press conference, which is to wring as much information as possible from the politician or press secretaries in a limited time.
The scammers do not live here, it's hard to find them, and when we do, our police (the FBI) have to deal with their laws and then arrest them and then transport them to us to be convicted. This is very complicated and very expensive. The scammers know that some of them will be found, and that some of those who are found will be convicted and put in prison, but they also know that most will get away with it.
Yes. Sometimes burglars leave no trace of their robbery, but it doesn’t make them innocent. But that’s not the case here. We are talking about a burglar who left his fingerprints and who is accused of the crime, and that’s when the finger of the rightful owner becomes important. Do you understand how finger-printing in this case makes the wrongly accused man innocent? That’s exactly what DNA in rape cases does.
To be clear, fighting is tolerated but penalized in the NHL and the American minor leagues. The NHL is especially strict on the use of makeshift weapons like sticks or skates that could cause severe injuries. In collegiate hockey, in European hockey, and in Olympic hockey it is not tolerated and is severely punished. The NHL referees stop a fight if one player has a significant advantage over the other; for example, if the player is down or has his head in the opponent’s back or is otherwise in a vulnerable position. So you can see two enforcers in the NHL agree to fight and square off with the referees watching, throwing punches (sometimes with their shirts on, since boxing on skates isn’t easy). But as soon as one of them goes down or gets a hold of his opponent’s head, the referees break up the fight.
I would guess it’s because it’s harder to prove texting while driving, whereas the other has a blood or breath test.
Pleading insanity is not done lightly, as it is often portrayed in popular culture. You would go through a very rigorous psychological evaluation, and if it is found that you are mentally unfit to understand right from wrong, you are then incarcerated with no fixed period of release, only when they decide you are cured. This means that instead of spending a few years in a low security prison, you could end up in an institution for ten or more years, constantly drugged and 'treated.' This is not a good trade-off.
There are many ways to do it, but one way is to compare the evidence left behind with medical records. Take, for example, a body that is half decomposed. The bone structure would indicate that the person is in her late twenties or early thirties, a female. The decomposition has largely progressed, so the body is no longer fresh. How much have things around the body grown (the roots of the plants and the like), because that can tell you when the body was left. Then you would take a look at the missing persons list and see which one fits the age, gender, and time frame. Then you would check the medical records to see if there are any injuries that correspond. Broken bones, dental fillings, etc. If they match, then it is probably the right person.
Some sentences are strictly until death (ie life without parole). Life with the possibility of parole means that unless someone decides you can go, you'll die in prison, so it's only temporary life. But in some countries, "life" is an arbitrary, e.g. 18 years, and not really life. In the Netherlands, it is like that, but there is a real life sentence for people who cannot be reintegrated into society, and then it is an arbitrary number of years.
Then, if it's 25 to 52 years, they have to spend 25 years before they can get out. He is then brought up for parole every so many years, until he gets out or serves the full 52 years.
A legal substance is a substance that is permitted in the law, and there is no law that prohibits it, like you aren’t allowed to drink Coca Cola. Something decriminalized means that there is or has been a law that it is illegal but that there is no punishment if you are caught with it.
The talent and skill are confined to a high box in the sky. We claim that it takes a lot to learn certain jobs, art, sports, etc. Basically, humans are very good at looking around and imitating, so even if you don't have the sense, you can still look like it and have a relative performance. But people often feel like imposters when they get a great deal more mastery than they initially expected. They convince themselves that they do not understand the fundamentals of a certain thing, but that they have to deceive it and risk being "exposed" for what they are. Generally, it disappears when confidence matches or exceeds competence for the object one is imposter at.
you can record a crime, you can record a murder and you won’t be prosecuted for recording a murder. But in a two party consent area you cannot record the speech, or even the identity, of someone without their consent. There are, however, some areas where there is one party consent, meaning that as long as one of the parties is aware of the recording, then the other is allowed to record. I think one of these is in Texas. I think this law was made for the interrogation rooms so that they could record innocent people without telling them that they were being recorded, but it could be used elsewhere as well.
It is mainly because there are still some things to be found and because German law does not have any statute of limitation for such crimes as murder. Now the only ones who are prosecuted are the small fry, because the historians now have to go through eighty-year-old files and occasionally find a new criminal who has not yet been convicted. It is the law in Germany that you can't just let things like that go. (Niel Hoegel, the so-called death nurse, is now on trial again for up to 100 of his five hundred murders, even though he has already been sentenced for six and is virtually assured of never being released.) Many people only joined the SS because their career would have been ruined. But with the SS it's different.
The teacher here is not from the country either, here are some reasons from the top of my head: 1. Being excluded from your community, ie the class, does something to a human being. The pupil is restrained from interfering with school and even learns more. 3. The parents learn about the bad behavior and will punish their child for it. 4. There are also school law reasons: In my school you have to be suspended five times before a much worse consequence can follow. So a suspension also serves as a warning.
In addition to the other answers, it may be that the public criminal records system in Florida is a little bit different from the rest of the country, so we hear about a few more cases of this kind of thing. The same reason we have a subreddit called r/FloridaMan.
The origin is the movie ‘The Matrix’. The question is basically whether Neo should take the blue pill, and remain in the secure, comfortable reality which he believes to be true, but which is actually only a fantasy; or the red pill, and see what is really going on, behind the lie which has been kept from him all his life. In the movie, Neo takes the red pill, thereby awakening himself from the great deception, and seeing the truth.
- it's all one clause. The first part, "...make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof, refers to any additional powers given to the federal government that are not specifically enumerated. This means that congress can pass laws setting up new executive departments without needing to amend the constitution to set up that department and to give it power to do whatever.
The truth is, in most cases, no one can be forced to give up something that belongs to him. So if Stan Lee’s family really does own the rights to the Marvel characters he created, then it’s up to them to come to an agreement with Disney. And these characters aren’t exactly cheap. As for why they’re suing, Stan Lee’s family has already taken legal action that puts the world on notice that they own these characters and that Disney isn’t using them with their permission. That might give Disney a better chance of winning a lawsuit, and it could make other studios more wary of collaborating with them. If it turns out that Disney is infringing on the family’s copyrights, then as a completely unrelated company that has a business relationship with them, you are not just an innocent bystander, but are actually a copyright infringer as well and could also be sued. In their lawsuit, which was filed in court, they’re not asking for money—they just want a court to rule that they are the rightful owners of the copyrights to the Marvel characters. That would provide certainty for everyone involved. For Disney, it would protect them from getting sued 20 years from now for each of the films they’ve made featuring the characters. And for other studios that do business with Disney, it would put them at ease, because they’d know that, legally speaking, the characters belong to Disney, and that as a third-party business dealing with them, they won’t have to worry about getting dragged into the mess.
Because we round down at 0. Generally speaking, we round off in groups of three, so zero to nine, ten to nineteen, twenty to twenty-nine, and so on. In your example, 10 isn’t rounded up; it’s rounded down, to the next lower group, which is the group from ten to nineteen.
because the American criminal justice system is a monetary racket. I’m not a lawyer, so I’m not qualified to answer the question. But, as an outside observer and former participant, that’s the best answer I have. As they say, freedom isn’t free. It’s because you don’t have to deal with the consequences of your actions if you can pay.
Well, it looks like I’m going to get downvoted to hell for this, but here we go. During the Kenosha riots, there were many people—some of them heroic, others of them savage, some of them terroristic—who took it upon themselves to protect various businesses from arson and looting. One of those people was Kyle Rittenhouse. He was charged with two counts of murder and, I believe, one count of attempted murder. During the course of the trial, it was revealed that the case against him was weak. The political left seems to see him as a terrorist or a murderer. The political right sees him as a hero or as someone defending himself. I personally think he acted in self-defense when he shot the people. But I also think that he made some bad decisions that put him in that situation. I can see manslaughter, but not murder.
Normally you’d expect the shot-in-the-shoulder-victim to be their star witness, but he was as thick as a plank and couldn’t help them. And it’s not just that. But there’s so much evidence of self-defense, it’s becoming a mountain to climb. The judge, I’m not sure about. He’s reserving judgment for the moment.
But no, not normally. Federal trials are not normally turned into trashy TV dramas, as local or state trials are. So no cameras in a court where business is being done.
In 2008, she was admitted to UCLA Medical Center and was on a 5150 hold. A few weeks later, she was back in the hospital on a 5150 hold. The day after she was admitted to the hospital for the second time, her father petitioned the court to be appointed as her conservator. Her father and his attorney are in charge of her estate. On July 31, the Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Reva Goetz extended the conservatorship until the end of the year. But on October 28, the same judge extended the conservatorship indefinitely. Due to the complexity of her brand, finances, and her susceptibility to outside influences. In July of 2012, her then-fiancé was appointed as her personal conservator, which does not involve her finances or her career. From that time on, several court cases were arranged by various lawyers and individuals, who argued that she could not take care of herself. In the year 2020, her attorney called her a “vegetable.” It is also revealed that her attorneys could have petitioned to end the conservatorship, but that would have meant another psychological evaluation, which seemed to be a deal breaker. This year, she has mostly been fighting to replace her father as her conservator, and finally win the right to choose her own lawyer, whom she has had for 13 years. TL; DR: She may have really needed the conservatorship for a while, but then it was more like six or seven people (Jamie, Judge Goetz, Ingram, Britney's lawyer, her ex-husband) manipulated the system for their own personal reasons. The Billboard article has a good time-line.
The extradition treaty is an agreement between the two countries that they will send people who are wanted in the other country for certain crimes. Each country can of course make extradition without such an agreement, but they may have to justify it internally (does the law allow you to arrest a person who has not broken any local law). The extradition treaty simply saves some legal hassle and e.g. makes it explicit that the police can arrest a person who has not broken the law locally, but has broken the laws in the other country).
Quite simply, there is no such boundary. Banning misinformation is a restriction on the free flow of information and can be a restriction for a number of reasons by a number of people in a number of situations, not all of which are bad. The rest of your post asks for subjective, speculative answers and we don't do those.
The actress had a very public breakdown 10 or 12 years ago and was ruled to be unable to handle her own business as a mature adult. The courts appointed her father and someone else as her conservators, which gives them power to make important decisions and manage her finances. Now that she seems to be in a better state of mind, she is subject to a Kafkaesque nightmare in which she has to prove to the same authorities that she is now capable of managing her own affairs.
This is why they have started putting common core into math recently because it’s too common. Before it was just memorization and no thinking. If you didn’t have it memorized you had nothing to fall back on. Now the students are taught to visualize and break down numbers so they can do things like this easily in their heads. It can be remedied but it takes some practice. Luckily, it’s not too difficult for an adult to pick up in a few weeks unless you have a learning disability. You just have to practice breaking down numbers into tens. For example, your 77+79 could be seen as 70+70+7+9=140. Now 140+16 is an easy calculation. Breaking down numbers is a very useful skill for mental math.
One has to have food, clothing and shelter to survive. There is no food and no water in the abandoned cities. Shelter may be available, but the means of survival—water, sewage, electricity, medical care, first-aid, fire departments, etc.—are missing. The cities are abandoned and there is no one to provide those services. If there were, they would not be abandoned. The homeless people might as well live in the wilderness if they are going to remain in abandoned cities.
In the old days, whenever countries needed money for something bad that suddenly needed lots of it, like a war, they would first spend all their gold and then, when they were out, they’d go off the gold standard. Then, when things got better, they would go back on the gold standard. Then World Wars I and II happened. The US was neutral at the beginning of both, so it got all the gold. Then things got so bad nobody could go back on the gold standard, so they agreed to use US dollars instead of gold, since the US had all their gold. But then France got mad that the US was dictating what they did and tried to get their gold back. The US refused and so it went off the gold standard. It thought it would just be for a short time, but once it was off the gold standard, it was able to do lots of things with its economy, like control how much money it had when the economy was going bad or booming. So it never went back on.
because India is not so industrialized. Most Indians are still engaged in agriculture, raising food for themselves and some for the market, which is necessary, but not very profitable. In the industrialized small countries, people produce much more valuable things, which result in a higher GDP.
Yes, it's a good thing for the super-wealthy to blow some of their riches instead of hoarding them. During the development of the rocket, it was probably a decent enough kickstart to the economy. So it was better for him to give his billions to various worthy causes. It could be argued that many billionaires got rich by exploiting the ordinary person, so some people believe they have a duty to give back to society (I'm not going to get into the ethics). But now the rocket has been developed, it's a question of space tourism. The super-wealthy paying the super-wealthy to indulge in a vacuous and highly polluting activity. There's not going to be much wealth creation and the economy won't be stimulated.
apple cash: paying twenty-five bucks to your buddy to get some weed. apple pay: using your credit card to buy food from a seven eleven after you've used all the weed. apple wallet: keeping a record of your medical records in case you fall when you go out of seven eleven and break your lip.
It means the speed at which an asset can be converted into cash. Obviously cash is the most liquid asset. You can move money around in your bank account, spending it right away. Stocks are highly liquid because you can sell them, get your money, and transfer it to your account within a week. But real estate isn’t so liquid, because you’ve got to list it on the market and the selling process can drag on for a while. So if you’re in need of money quickly, this isn’t going to help you, unless you’re willing to sell it for less than its value. Liquidation means a complete conversion of an asset into cash. Say you own ten shares of a company. You can sell them and receive the money within a week. You’ve liquidated. You sell your car? You’ve liquidated your car. You sell your house? You’ve liquidated your house, since it’s no longer in your possession, but you have cash. How liquid something is depends on how quickly you need the cash. Let’s say you have a Rolex worth fifteen thousand dollars. You can sell it for fifteen thousand, but it will take some time. If you need money right away, you can sell it for a hundred dollars, and someone will buy it from you. The same goes for a house. You can sell it for a million, but that will take a long time. You can sell it for a hundred thousand quickly, but it won’t be for its full value.
When you get a notification, the transport company has probably just printed the label and calculated the route for your package on existing timetables. The package is probably transferred to another truck at least twice and may even go on a plane, train or boat. There it is transferred to a truck that is driving all night to a distribution point near you. The next morning a truck delivers the packages to everyone in your area. They do this every day on the same schedule.
Pandemic. First of all, the demand went down because of the pandemic, therefore the production was reduced. And as the demand rose, the production didn’t increase, so the price rose. Furthermore, the transport of the goods went down. Truck drivers were unable to make deliveries.
There is a change in currency. A new one is issued with more reasonable values, and the old one is not accepted for trade after a certain period. Venezuela has already done it once, and is preparing to do it again. This eliminates the difficulties with huge currency values, but does not remove the root cause of the hyperinflation, which is not solved until government policy changes. In some countries the sovereignty of the currency is completely abolished and the people are forced to use the dollar or the euro, so that politicians cannot create a new hyperinflation, which of course brings other problems.
; That depends on the item and whether it is tracked. If you are at a large store, like a chain of grocery stores or a large bookstore, all sales are generally recorded and sent to the manufacturer or to companies such as Nielsen or IRI that are in the business of collecting and selling information. Smaller stores will often send their sales only if they are asked to do so. But there are some items where the company will record a sale merely by shipping them to a store. They may not even care if the store actually sells them or not; that isn't their concern; their customer is the store, not the consumer. That's very common. This is often recorded as "units shipped" or "units sold." Books are kind of wacky in that there are a few ways to count book sales that are all valid, but would result in very different numbers. We will not talk about the books because they are a bad and confusing example.
An option contract = 100 shares. You determine a date (a Friday) and a price (the highest price) at which you will be entitled to buy those 100 shares. You pay the price (the premium) for those 100 shares. You buy a call option one week ago. And suppose the share was at one dollar one week ago, and then one week from now it goes to five dollars, so you have in effect 500 dollars’ worth of stock for the sixty dollars you have paid, which leaves you with a profit of 440 dollars, less the price of the stock (three hundred) that you would have paid to buy it at the strike price. You can exercise your option (buy the stock for one dollar, therefore 100 shares, and sell for five dollars), or you can sell the contract before expiration if it has gone up to nearly the strike price. Most people sell their call options and do not exercise them. If the stock goes up to ten dollars, you pay two dollars plus twenty cents, for a total of twenty-two dollars. That means you make twenty percent, and if the stock is worth zero tomorrow, you get back a hundred dollars. You profit. It is as if you were buying a stock that is far too expensive, but you believe it will go up. You pay a small part of the price. You exercise your option if you have the money, or you simply profit.
For the same reason everything is worth money—because someone is willing to pay for it. But this also means that NFTs are only worth what someone is willing to pay for them, which can be from 'nothing because they're kind of a stupid idea' to 'omg I'll give you my house this is going to the moon'.
Because every dollar you’ve saved is suddenly worth only half as much. And prices will double faster than the money supply.
When something like the cost of fuel and transportation goes up, the public usually accepts the increase. But when costs go down, the public doesn't pay as much attention, so it's easy to make profits for a while without the public noticing. And the only way to reduce prices when costs decrease is for competitors to do so. If one of the competition reduces prices, the others drop their prices to compete. If they don't drop, it's the same as the price cartel.
banks do not lend their own money, but lend the money of their clients and pocket the interest.
Aside from selling them, they can make money by dividends. Dividends are when the company gives the shareholders a cut of its profits.
It would be $7B per year for logistics. We produce enough food here in the U.S., I believe, but most of it goes to waste. So the problem is logistics, both in getting the food to the right places and putting it into packages that can be shipped. But we know the approximate cost of these things.
People want to buy shares in the company. Technically, share price doesn't really represent the company's net assets or turnover. Share price is an investment in the future. Why does everyone think there's so much future in Tesla? Depending on the investors, but in general they notice that the company is investing heavily, expanding rapidly, there's a higher demand for its products and services than there is supply, and that it not only makes electric cars but also an entire electric and electric-storage infra-structure, including batteries, the battery industry, energy storage and the production of green electricity. This is not just a rapidly growing company but one that is obviously hugely prospective. This is an integrated multi-industrial company with potentially disruptive and market-leading capabilities. It's hard to find a company that can compete with it in its entirety. If you look at Tesla as just an electric car company, the price doesn't make sense. But if you take a wider view, it's still probably too expensive, but at least it's a reasonable price.
The fatal combination of the deepening corruption and the inability to keep up with the United States in military spending. The USSR tried to address these problems with an economic reform that leaned toward capitalism, and it softened its rules about elections and political parties. This eventually led to the break-up of the union with the help of the local governments on the border, albeit not without a final attempt by the Communists to prevent it by a coup. This failed.
APR stands for annual percentage rate, so it includes a time component. I hope this helps. But it gets more complicated.
It's a government agency that controls the securities market, including the stock market. Every company that sells stocks in the United States must comply with laws made by Congress and enforced by the SEC.
MLM is a very simple business concept, because everything is left up to the independent sellers. All you have to do is hook people into the MLM and get them to buy your sales package. Then it doesn’t matter whether the product is sold to the customers; you’ve already made your money.
It can. It's just not a good idea. Though there's a philosophical question: if you have completely open borders, is it still a country, since everyone is, so to speak, in the country? If you have completely open borders, you will lose control over border security, trade policy, migration and several other issues which the government and citizens have legitimate concerns about. Completely open borders mean you no longer have the choice of doing so.
No. When you grow food or cut down trees or mine raw materials, you are ‘producing’ wealth and adding it to the economy. That wealth was not there before and you did not take the potatoes or wood or iron ore from someone else. So no one has to be poorer for you to be richer.
They use the secret of exchanging cash for goods in international business. Here's an example: The buyer has to buy the goods for $ 10,000, and the seller will give him the money directly, and the buyer will pay the money back to him. The buyer is asked to write a formal order of $9,000, and then he will send $ 1,000 to an offshore bank account. So the official return to China is $9,000, and the remaining $1,000 is hidden overseas. This is not only for China. The billionaire can buy something worth $ 10,000 from a foreign branch, but the branch can only take the profit, fee, or commission of $ 1,000, and the remaining $9,000 is transferred to the head office in China, and the remaining $ 1,000 is hidden overseas. The branch can naturally explain this $1,000 as the operating expenses of the local branch, such as wages, rent, etc.
The debt of countries is not like the debt of a loan shark or a credit card. It is not something that has to be paid in full, and the interest will kill you if you do not pay it. It is much more like having a mortgage. It is a long-term debt with a small interest rate. In the United States it is very easy for a person to take out a mortgage on a house, the payment of which is much higher than his annual salary. The United States has an excellent credit rating because it has always repaid its debts. Therefore it can borrow large amounts of money at a low interest rate, and the public is not particularly worried about it, partly because the economy of the United States is so strong.
One man owns a stock. He asks to borrow it for a short time, and then immediately sells it at the market price. Wait for the stock to go down. Buy it back. Return the stock to the lender. And pocket the difference.
This is just a fancy way of saying that the books must be open and freely accessible to the public so that people can see exactly what has been spent on. That way people can look them up in their spare time and see how the money is spent. It's the same idea as "open source" software. It is said that the source code is open to the public for review and revision, and thus that it will lead to a better program because many people will examine the source code to optimize it, find bugs, and make sure it does what it says it does. In this case, however, the public can't revise the books, but they can see the expenditure.
But because of the boom, the old population will at some point outnumber the young population and then, since there will not be enough young people paying into the system, Social Security will run out and then there will be no more Social Security for those who did not make arrangements. This is an even greater problem in China, where, because of the one-child rule, the number of old people will soon be many more than the number of young people. No matter what system they have, it’s too much, and they have no infrastructural support (hospitals, nursing homes, etc.)
The answer depends on a lot of things that you don’t say—where you live, who gave you the money, and so on.
Not that there is too much money in the market. But a crash happens when there is not enough credit. When banks and other financial institutions stop credit (either because they themselves don’t have enough to lend, or because they’re afraid to lend to people and companies in certain industries), then businesses can’t expand or grow, so they cut back. And that means layoffs and cuts in salaries. Then that leads to falling stock prices. I’m not sure whether prices rise. Prices do rise, for some products, and the rise is most painful for staples that people need every day, but cannot buy as easily as they used to, like food, gas, etc. Some industries are hit harder than others, like tourism and entertainment, because people have no money to spend on things other than the essentials to run their households. But some industries actually see falling prices, like cars and houses, because the market is either flooded or stagnant, and people are buying fewer and fewer. That affects stock prices and the value of things like real estate that people have invested in. And that causes all the economic problems to escalate and escalate.
I’m a medical assistant. Let’s say the average hourly rate is $16. But some companies pay $20-$22 per hour. I tell an employer in an interview that I’ve received a higher offer, and they still try to lowball me at $16. Why can’t they compete with those higher-paying companies? Is this just because they’re cheap, or is it for some reason related to economics? Any rational employer will pay the lowest possible rate for the best possible employee. If they feel they have a good chance of finding that employee, they will go ahead and try. The employers have the same problem. You have offers from other employers. The employers also have other applicants.
Basically inflation is going to continue, yes. I can’t give you a good answer as to whether in eighty years we’ll be paying $5,000 for a banana, but in general inflation is supposed to continue. Various treasuries or reserves or central banks around the world have as a primary goal to keep inflation at a rate low enough to be sustainable, which means that employers will continue to hire people, individuals will continue to invest and buy, etc. It’s generally thought that deflation is a sign of a shrinking economy, where people don’t spend but instead save, which hurts businesses and the stock market.
They provide no benefits to society, but they do provide benefits to themselves. Publicly traded companies are publicly traded because at some point they decided they needed cash to expand. This does mean that the average person can buy a piece of the company and make some money from it if he wants to.
You sell them to someone else who, just like you, at some point, wants to buy them. They pay you. When you bought the stock, you paid money for it. When you sell it, you get money for it, because you are transferring it to someone else.
If you assume that everything it says is true, then it works exactly the same way it does for any other country.
Because I can hire you for a specific task, pay you an agreed price and duration, and no longer have any obligation to you after the job is done or if I decide to fire you. You come with your own insurance, your own management, your own equipment (usually), and your own payment system. You are a separate entity to my company. Hiring employees is more complicated, and usually takes much longer and costs much more. For one-time, non-recurring tasks, contractors are the best option.
In the dictionary: “An illegal investment (in the US and elsewhere) in which each paying participant must recruit two new participants, and the profits are paid to early participants with the money contributed by later participants.” In other words, you pay a dollar to a person above you and a lot of people below you pay you a dollar. And generally a percentage of the money you get from below goes to the person above you. Some people at the top get rich, and the people at the bottom pay their dollar but never get it back.
That's been tried for years. That didn't work. Paywall models are more profitable for newspapers. Besides, if the articles were free, there would be even less incentive for subscribers to get the printed papers.
It’s a fraud to take out loans without any intention of paying them back. You can’t for instance spend thousands of dollars and then file for bankruptcy. It’s also rare that people get large uncollateralized loans. One can get a line of credit, if you have, for example, property, which the debt is guaranteed by, and giving away the money would mean losing the property. Moreover, although debts cannot be passed on, creditors do have first claim on the estate of the deceased. If you have anything you want to pass on to your children, it will first be sold to pay your debts before it can be passed on to them.
It is best to read up on day trading on the web, but keep in mind that short-term capital gains taxes are usually much higher, so you need to plan on the higher tax rate before you actually get into day trading.
The formulas used by AMMs differ, but there is one thing in common: for the purpose of providing a liquid pool from which to purchase assets, a liquidator of the market allocates part of both assets of a trading pair to a liquid pool. But when a buyer buys either asset, the supplier is short of it. (That is, the supplier's claim on the liquid pool is reduced for the amount of what the buyer bought, while the supplier's claim on the amount of the other asset is increased.) At first glance, it would seem that the total value should remain the same, but it doesn't. To illustrate with an exaggerated example, let's say that the trading pair is Bert and Eddie, and that at the moment of creating the BERT-ERNIE liquid pool, the assets are valued in other markets at five dollars each. If you allocate ten of Bert and ten of ERN to the pool, and then there are no other changes in the market, the total value of the assets is five dollars. You have contributed five x 5 = ten dollars to the pool. Then I buy one ERNIE for one BERT, and now the pool has nine ERN and eleven BERT. If you withdraw the assets, will the nine ERN and eleven BERT you get be worth the ten ERN and ten BERT you deposited? Clearly, the demand for ERN is greater than the demand for BERT (this is shown by the purchase), and so maybe ERN is now worth five dollars and BERT is now worth four and a half. The total value of the pool is nine dollars (nine dollars of ERN) plus eleven dollars (eleven dollars of BERT), that is, nine dollars nine and a half dollars, or nine dollars nine and a half. Impermanent loss (or divergence loss) is one dollar. It is called an impermanent loss because the lost value can return if the cyclicality of the market changes; but it may not, and therefore the name impermanent loss is deceptive. For more discussions, ask in r / defi.
Agents are useful because they do all the negotiating and all the work, which means the boss doesn’t have to do it. The agent could be the stern voice who says no and bargains for more money, and that way the star player stays away from it all.
it means pay that is in the same ballpark as pay in similar jobs and companies. If, for example, the going rate is $15/hr for a restaurant job, and your restaurant pays $9/hr, your pay is not competitive.
But how could a broker possibly know the name of every company to be able to properly clear a transaction? When two traders meet, they both send their order information to the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse matches the two orders. They only know the trader and the ticker symbol. This is why trades don’t settle immediately but are settled T+2 days.
There are a few possible answers. 1. They are a big money spinner, and it is written off. Write-offs only work if you would have made the profit anyway. 2. They are sponsored by a company. If I have a huge following, a company might give me the prize, in exchange for publicity. (I can then write the cost off). 3. The giveaway is paid for by a company. The entry fee pays for the prize. 4. The prize is given away only if certain conditions are met. I have seen this on house giveaways. The fine print says a lesser prize will be given if sufficient tickets are sold. 5. Insurance. If the prize is not guaranteed, they might have insurance cover for the prize. 6. They are a straight giveaway. They are giving the prize away in the hope of future exposure. (Or they haven't done the math). 7. It is a scam. There may be others, but those are the most common.
They merely indicate that you are basically in sympathy with the economic system which has been largely constructed upon the work of the person so designated (or, more accurately, with the system which has been constructed upon the work of that person). A “Smiiiiithianism,” or “Free Market,” would favor a free market, or as it is called today, a “Laissez-Faire Economy.” These schools are merely that—schools. Let us assume that an economist teaches a course on Marx, and that he is followed by a few students, some of whom have had the opportunity to read Marx. The work of this group will then largely build upon Marx and the theories that have been derived from him.
What determines the value of a currency of a country is the demand for that currency and the fluctuating value from day to day according to the economic development of the country, the possibility of buying a certain commodity in a particular currency, the difference between the interest rates, and so on. The fact that one currency is a large multiple of another, if the values of the monetary units were fixed in the country, such as the price of a loaf of bread or a day's pay. Although in fact they were not chosen, they just “turned up”.
I’m not very smart either. But I think I’ve figured out that when prices go up, the people with less money can’t keep up, and the people with more money start to see the value of their money slipping away. Please feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.
It is not true that lottery and gambling revenue is a multiple increase in education budgets. For example, Illinois has about $3 billion in lottery and gambling revenue. Of this, about $900 million goes to educational expenses. That is less than 20 percent of the state’s education budget. However, most of the state’s education budget comes from local property taxes, which makes the quality of schools more dependent on local property taxes. In some localities (for example, affluent suburbs) the schools are excellent; others that raise and spend less locally have mediocre schools.
: They do. About 70 percent of the income of the government is paid by the top 10 percent. What the ultra rich don’t do is pay income tax, because their money comes from capital gains, which are subject to a lower ceiling than wages. So raising the income tax will not actually raise more income when you focus on the top brackets, because they don’t apply to a lot of people. (Correction: I corrected the percentage of the government)
It’s hard to explain simply, because if you simplify too much, then the trolls will come out from under the bridge and “Well, actually...” you to death. But the basic problem was that we kept making more and more money, but we couldn’t make more gold. Yes, we could mine it, but the more we mined, the harder it was to find more, and we didn’t own all the gold in the world. It was even worse than that: with technological progress, we discovered more and more important uses for gold. So it was obvious that we would always have more money than gold, which meant we’d have to keep changing how we exchanged money for gold, and that would be a disaster for the financial sector, which likes to keep the value of its money pretty much the same. So we thought about it and asked ourselves if it was really necessary for society to have money backed by a tangible asset, or if people trusted the United States enough to take the money for what it said on the jar. It turned out that most people were happy with this solution. People still buy gold and other precious metals just in case, but there’s no longer an official procedure to convert dollars into gold—although in essence, buying gold is the same as exchanging dollars for gold.
We basically ask people how much it's worth. Every day, everyone asks everyone else how much a dollar is worth by exchanging them for goods and services, agreeing on the prices. It's a little more obvious when we trade one currency for another, but that's pretty much how it works.
When you need money, you borrow. Instead of going to a bank and asking for a hundred million yen loan, you can sell bonds to different investors. Each of them will own a small part of the total loan, and in return, the issuer promises to pay interest at certain intervals. This interest goes to the bondholders as the cost of borrowing, while you, as the bond issuer, will earn it as profit for the risk you are taking by lending your money.
Someone puts a bunch of mortgages into a bundle and sells it as a whole real estate investment. Someone buys it and also buys a credit default swap to protect against a default. The person who sold the CDS gets money with the expectation that he will not have to pay anyone. It is an insurance policy based on the assumption that while some people could lose their jobs and not pay their mortgage, the chances of everyone in the group doing the same were small. Until they weren't.
if an airplane has 200 seats and the flight is sold with 200 tickets, there will usually be some who won't go for various reasons. So the plane is sold with 205 tickets, but if they all show up, they are in trouble. Since the profit margin is very small in the air travel industry, those extra tickets can make the difference between whether the flight makes money or not.
Social security and Medicare tax (payroll tax) is paid on wages, which helps to fund your retirement benefit.
Supply and demand. We (especially in the U.S.) depend on products manufactured in China. Even if an item is manufactured in the U.S. (cereal, for example), the packaging will probably have been made of something from China, be it the printer ink or the plastic trays the cereal sits in. There are four problems affecting imports: a. A COVID-inspired strike in China, shutting down factories and ports, has been going on for months. b. Once the strike was over, factories began to fill backorders, which clogged the ports and the transportation services that haul goods to the port. The ports have so many containers to handle, and so many workers. If there’s a reduction in the number of people working in them, the ports will be further clogged. c. For example, California recently had hundreds of ships waiting to enter the port. It caused a traffic jam on the ocean. d. The Evergreen ship Ever Given also contributed to the worldwide port congestion. It got stuck blocking the Suez Canal in Egypt, and there was no way for ships to turn around and go back, so thousands of ships were stuck for weeks. Some rerouted their ships around Africa, which meant they’d add weeks to their travel time. e. These hold-ups at the port affected the wholesale prices. f. And there are other, more local supply problems. For months now, there have been shortages of chicken. That’s because farmers last year slaughtered chickens rather than send them to the slaughterhouse, and they’re not sending them to the slaughterhouse now because of labor shortages at the slaughterhouses and because of the COVID. So we can expect higher prices for meat, fish, and produce for at least another year.
This is actually a very simple question, believe it or not! It is a matter of supply and demand, and stocks behave in that respect like real physical objects (but not in others). Sometimes, there are more buyers than sellers of a certain security. But of course, in a given period of time, the number of shares bought must equal the number of shares sold. That gap can only be filled if some of the buyers are willing to pay slightly more than the asking price. That raises the new asking price. The reverse reasoning is true for falling prices. Since the whole system is so automatic and involves so many transactions, it gives the impression that prices rise and fall automatically. But it’s really the same way any other price is set.
If they are found to be at fault by the organizers, or to have intentionally caused the crash, they may be fined. Otherwise, it is just a racing incident.
The price of a house is not the same thing as the cost of the mortgage. If you took out a 3.9% mortgage several years ago on a $200,000 house, you would have been paying $1,327.61 per month. If you took out a 2.4% mortgage on a $350,000 house, you would have been paying $1,383.00 per month. The drop in interest rates has meant that you can afford a much more expensive house because your monthly payment hasn’t changed nearly as much. When interest rates were around 20% in the early 1980s, a $80,000 house would have cost you $1,291.96 per month. So, here you have three different house prices, three different interest rates, and a monthly payment that doesn’t vary more than a few dollars. So, don’t look at the price of the houses, but at the cost of the monthly payments with today’s interest rates.
The official exchange rate is the number of Lebanese pounds the government promises to buy for a dollar. So the government promises that for every pound it gives you, it will give you a dollar. But this promise is as good as the government's ability to pay you a dollar in exchange for Lebanese pounds. Which at present is zero. The only people who can trade at this rate are a very small number of importers who import essential products, such as food and fuel. But, as the recent fuel crisis demonstrated, the government no longer has enough dollars to pay importers at the official rate. The black market rate is the real market rate. It is the exchange rate at which you would expect to buy or sell if you were not someone the government has allocated dollars to for the purpose of importing essential goods.
The pharmacists in the United States basically have what we call “fake” cash prices. Insurers have a maximum they’ll pay for a particular drug, but if the cash price at the pharmacy is lower, they’ll pay the lower amount. So the pharmacies set these cash prices at an absurdly high level to ensure they’re always higher than the maximum insurance reimbursement. But programs like GoodRx deal directly with the pharmacy benefit managers that the insurers do. That way, they have access to the “real” prices, not just the deliberately inflated cash prices.
The money you get for selling the house goes first to paying off the rest of the mortgage, then you keep the rest. If you have bought a house for 500, - kr., and have already paid a hundred kr. to the mortgage, and you sell it for 600, - kr., you will get 400 for your mortgage and 200 for yourself. Obviously this is a simplified version and does not take into account estate agent's fees, recording fees, the interest rate and the specific conditions of the loan. I'm just talking in general about where the money goes.
a budget surplus is simply the money left over after satisfying all your needs. A surplus is the excess of something that remains after you’ve used up all you need of the original thing. So if you’re bringing in $2,000 a month and have budgeted $800 for rent, $200 for groceries and $100 for gas, well, you’ve budgeted $1100, and at the end of the month you expect to have a surplus of $900. It’s the same thing with government spending. It needs to pay for schools and road repair and police and firefighters, and it budgets the money for all that, and it gets the money from taxes. But sometimes the tax money brings in more than enough to cover all the budgeted spending, so it comes out with a surplus.
In theory the debt ceiling prevents the US from running up unlimited debt, which would be bad. In practice it’s a political tool that a lot of different interest groups use to make various appeals to voters who are probably not looking into the matter any deeper than a headline on a Facebook page. It is a problem that only Congress can solve, which makes it a negotiating tool for some members of Congress. It sticks around because the campaign against it – “Oh, you just want unlimited debt” – is incredibly easy to run, and people gobble it up.
The contracts that have been signed beforehand. There's no simple explanation for it. There may be various companies or estates or people (such as the author) that own the rights to the property. Also, there may be various actors, directors, studios, etc., that may be given a certain percentage of the profits, and so on.
Life insurance is not savings. You don’t always get back what you pay in, for instance, if you let your policy lapse or you cancel it. However, you will get the face value of your policy in the event of your death. You could start a $2 million policy next month and pay them a first-month premium of $100, and if you are killed in an accident, the company will cut your family a check for $2 million.
Since, the income tax is not only based on the salary of one job but also on the deductions that reduce the taxable income. In order to pay exactly the right amount to a government employee, they need to know the salaries of their spouses and other sources of income. But ninety-five percent of people do not know this until the end of the year.
The government needs money to operate. The government has debts running into the trillions. Taxing the wealthy means that the government can reduce taxes on those with lower incomes, reduce the debt so as to have greater flexibility when the next crisis occurs, and provide services it does not now or at least provide them better. Look at the advantages that other countries enjoy: universal health care, paid maternity leave, subsidized child care, subsidized college or university, well-functioning public transport, etc., etc., etc. And none of that would be in the least wasteful or pointless.
His shares in Amazon, for example. So if you multiply the value of a share at the time by the number of shares, you get a figure for his worth. And 99.99999% of his worth is in shares, not in cash, not in land, not in bank accounts.
A credit score is a number generated by credit bureaus for lenders to determine your ability to pay your bills and your loans. It is a quick way to figure out if you will pay your bills.
There are different methods of building wealth. Take a man like Jeff Bezos, most of his wealth is in Amazon stock, which has risen to over $99 billion, but he only pays taxes on the gains if he sells. So while his stock has risen tens of billions of dollars, he doesn’t pay taxes on that. If he sells, for example, to cover his living expenses, he pays taxes on capital gains, which are less than taxes on income—only 21% if your income is above $400,000, so assuming he paid nothing for the shares, then he pays $2 million. Not nothing, but really a rounding error compared to his wealth. The other way the ultra-rich can reduce their tax bills is by operating a business, which reduces their taxable income and gives them access to pre-tax money to spend. If you are a dentist, for example, and want to vacation in Hawaii, you could go to a dental convention and deduct some of the expenses for the trip—some of the hotel, some of the meals, and the flight—which could greatly reduce the actual cost of the trip. The dentist could also lease a Mercedes from his dental practice, which would also reduce his income and reduce the taxes he pays on the car. Or that MacBook Pro he sometimes uses to check on his patients from home. Same thing.
From the moment of a child’s birth until he is twenty years old, he costs society more than he earns. Afterwards he begins to contribute to society and give a little back. The economy is good because you get workers without that costly “start-up” cost. The downside is that if the newcomers have no skills and can’t do much to contribute, they aren’t worth the effort. That’s why we have laws to let in the best.
There are several different kinds of bankruptcy. The first is liquidation, which means “So long, and here’s the door,” and you sell off everything to pay off the debt, and then the company goes out of business. The second is reorganization, where you negotiate with the creditors and try to reduce your debt by giving them some ownership of the company. This is the most common kind of bankruptcy, especially for big companies. That’s what Hertz did, and that allowed it to stay in business, survive the pandemic and its associated difficulties, and be able to take advantage of the recovery once the economy turned around.
Inflation is a very complex phenomenon, which is one of the reasons why it is so difficult to stop completely. It is common for people to blame it on the fact that we may print too much money, but there is more to it than that. Like so many other things in the world today, the current inflation crisis is caused by excessive debt and the supply and demand issue. In the first course of the economics course, we learn about the supply and demand for goods. If the supply of a good is great and the demand is low, the price of the individual good will be low. If the supply is low and the demand is high, the price of the individual good will be high. For the past year and a half, consumers have been spending less money on goods. If people don't buy, companies don't make them, and stores don't store them. (As a result of low demand) But now that people are spending money again, the supply has not yet been adjusted. Since the demand has risen and the supply has not yet caught up, the price of the individual good has risen. A second cause of the current inflation crisis is the consequence of the government's efforts to keep the economy going when people weren't buying as much. This was done, among other things, by the Fed lowering the interest rate to almost zero. That's a complex issue in itself. But all you need to know for now is that almost zero interest leads to a rise in the number of loans and mortgages. But unfortunately, the housing market is also limited, so the price of each house is higher. All this means that the purchasing power of the dollar has become less, or at least the market thinks so. However, this does not mean that you should go and buy up all the things that are valuable now. This kind of temporary inflation will be eliminated, and it has already started; At least it has already begun to occur on the real estate market.
Why should they? And how could they do it? Exchange is a market. If you have a freely floating currency, the market determines the value. If you want to control it, you have to pump money into it or take it out, and thus waste your reserves, to maintain the desired rate. Or you have to peg it and create black markets...
It's a cartoon. He is both broke from working at a fast-food restaurant and can't afford a balloon, and rich enough to buy a whole lot of cereal just to get a free toy or an abundance of night lights.
- Like the museum security guards, to reduce the risk of art theft, the big investors use futures on something like index funds, to reduce their losses if the markets go down. Someone, somewhere, always "sells" the opposite. If you buy a particular derivative, without knowing why, then yes, it's just like betting.
Imagine taking out a five percent loan when the inflation rate is 10 percent. That means you'll pay back less money, after adjusting for inflation, and the bank will lose money. So to stay in business, the bank has to raise interest rates, so your debt increases faster than the value of the money decreases.
They buy all the shares of Company B, so they pay it to the people who are selling them the shares.
Multilevel marketing, it’s like a pyramid... well, it is a pyramid, but it has a different name because everybody knows a pyramid is a swindle.
They cant loan out money they dont have, but they can loan out 90 per cent of the money that is not theirs but yours. And since the loanee can turn around and put the loan in the bank, this procedure does in fact create money.
This is because car sales are very odd. Car dealers are not owned by car companies. They buy cars from the company, and sell them to private people. If you can't sell all the cars you buy, you'll have to pay for the cars that are left in the lot. Every dealer is different, but if it's a quota system, every salesman will have a certain number of cars to sell each month. For example, 50 a month. The salesman gets a commission of the selling price plus an additional percentage if the car is sold at a high price. If the salesman is in the lower number, he will be in a hurry to sell the car at the end of the month and give up the high price bonus. But not all dealers have quotas. Even if the quota is set, there is no reason why the quota is due on the last day of the month. It can be 15, 5, and so on. The more detailed answer is more complicated, and it depends on the dealer, the manufacturer, and the salesman, and so on, to the extent that he is willing to make a good deal or not.
The slap on the wrist involves not being able to purchase a home for a minimum of six years.
Consider skins in games. Once they're made, they're an unlimited resource. But since people will pay ten dollars for one, why should they give them away for free? Profit is what destroys the planet, and how people take more from society than they give.
There are several major components to GDP. 1. Personal consumption expenditure (PCE). This is essentially everything people buy with money, whether it’s big (cars, refrigerators), small (an apple or a shirt), or not a thing at all (a doctor’s visit, a college education). This accounts for most of the U.S. GDP, about 70%. 2. Business investment. This includes businesses buying new software, machinery, new factories, etc. It also includes new residential construction, but not existing residential sales. This is about 20% of the U.S. GDP. 3. Government spending. This is the spending done by the federal, state, and local governments. This includes everything from fighter jets to the guy who plows your snow. This is about 15% of the U.S. GDP. Wait, that makes 105%? 4. Net exports. This is everything you send to other countries minus everything other countries send to you. Since the United States is transitioning to a service economy, and services are hard to export, the United States is a net importer of goods. This is about -5% of the U.S. GDP. So what doesn’t count? Everything produced outside the United States. Everything that gets resold (like houses or craigslist items), all government transfers (like food stamps or welfare), everything that’s used as a component for something else (called an intermediate good), all financial transactions (sorry, r/WorldScientific), and last but not least: the black market. The gram of weed you bought from your dealer contributes to the local economy and maybe the international economy, but not to the U.S. GDP.
The Labour party has its origins in the labour movement, and its aim is to be a socialist party. It has been the second largest party in the UK since the late 1920s, though for most of that time the Conservative party has been in power. In the nineties, it underwent major changes, which many would say made it less socialist and more of a neoliberal party, advocating free markets and a very limited role for the state in the economy. The years 1997-2010 were the longest period when it was in power; it has not been in power since. The party has close links with the trade unions and still stands to the left of the Conservatives, but is now a more centrist party. Its members and elected representatives are in the centre or centre-left of the spectrum, with party members being a bit further to the left and more socialist, and MPs more economically liberal. The party is pro-welfare and pro-public ownership, and over the last ten years has generally favoured more government spending. It is a bit more socially liberal than the Conservatives, though it competes with them on being “tough on crime”. It also advocates a “strong” defence and having a “strong” relationship with the European Union, especially in parliament.
Blood has to be collected, tested, sanitized, stored - all the people and equipment that does this costs money. Blood has to be transported from collection and processing centers to hospitals, which costs money. Blood has to be administered by medical personnel, which costs money and is administered in facilities that cost money.

All those who saw Evergrande as a viable investment in the “emerging market” infrastructure will lose their money. They’ll be disappointed, but the global economy will continue to roll.
Historically, wars or other disasters have usually broken it. We are a bit in the dark. We have never experienced such a long stretch of more or less continuous growth. Probably it can't go on forever, and climate change and our reaction to it probably have a great influence. We have also never been so globally overextended, so much of the future earnings are promised to foreigners. Inflation is actually good for people and governments who borrow money, because the value of the loan becomes less than the money they get today. But it's basically a game of chicken, who is the first to see the sign of their budget balance.
Never. You don't pay "more taxes" except in the sense that you pay taxes on the more you make. But since the top tax bracket is not over 100, you can't lose money by making more. Taxes are always a percentage of the next dollar earned. Rising up a tax bracket doesn't affect the money you made on the lower bracket. The tax rate for the top bracket applies to the part of your income that's over the threshold for that bracket.
The interest must be paid on the debt. Every dollar going towards the debt service is a dollar that is not spent on other services. It must be noted that like personal debt, not all debt is bad. Taking a loan for college that then (in most cases) results in a higher lifetime income is good. In much the same way, government borrowing and spending can yield a higher return than the interest paid on the debt.
In what context? The usual thing about hyperinflation is that it is the unintended result of people not knowing what they’re doing with their monetary policy. Or knowing exactly what they’re doing, but enriching themselves on the backs of those who don’t know.
Those who require a PIN are processing your card as a debit card, those who do not are processing it as a credit card. Paying with a credit card means the business gets charged a fee by the credit card company, but debit is free since it takes money out of your bank account. Using a credit card is a little more convenient so some businesses prefer to pay the extra fees, while requiring a PIN is less convenient. Edit: To add to my answer, see u/FSchmertz's comment in which he pointed out that it is possible for merchants and/or payment service to require a PIN for debit purchases.
I don’t run them over on purpose.
Because there's been a global shortage of microchips that control the new cars, so there haven't been any new cars on the market for at least eight months, which means demand for used cars is soaring, which drives prices up.
1: When business expenses exceed revenue, the excess can't be used to reduce your income from another source. But you can carry forward the negative amount of your expenses to the following year and deduct it from your income from YouTube in 2022. 2: The business lost money, so the tax man doesn't care... 3. 50$. The business earned $80, so the tax man gets a 50% cut. 4. 60$. The business earned $120, so the tax man got a 50% cut.
People accept coins, but then never use them again, in part out of a desire to avoid any contact with public surfaces, in view of the present health situation. In such cases a much larger supply of coins must be produced and circulated in order to satisfy the needs of people and institutions who wish to use them.
It's expensive labor. Then there's the assembly, and if they have to create a special kit so that everything fits together, that costs money. If you build a new car, you have economies of scale and it's much faster and cleaner to build a car in an assembly line.
The Fed has not raised interest rates. That's as simple an explanation as you can get. Why not? Well, the Fed has a very controversial role — while they have to control inflation, they have to deal with very expensive assets, and it's a very delicate economic and political matter to raise rates.
It is a good way to improve the economy, but it requires a lot of work, you need to build hotels, restaurants, bars, public transport, etc., to serve the tourists, police, street cleaners, etc., to make the place look safe and clean for tourists from rich countries with high standards for that, and do a lot of advertising, etc. and all that needs to be paid for before tourists start coming, so an economy that is not working might not have enough money to afford it. Also, it is a risky investment, because it is difficult to predict how successful the advertising will be and there are so many things that you can not control, like the weather and the economy of other countries. Some countries, even if they could theoretically be a tourist destination, may choose to invest in other strategies for improving the economy.
Nothing. In Canada they’ve done away with the penny. They now round up to the nearest nickel. It costs more than 1 cent to produce a penny. It’s senseless to produce them.
There are two major ways to calculate investment returns. There are dozens, but what you are really looking for is the difference between “time-weighted” and “money-weighted” returns. There are many formulas to calculate both and both are useful. Each dollar you put in and take out gets weighted to produce a total return, which can be different based on how you put in and take out the money. The difference is that time-weighted returns do not take into account the time when you put money in or take money out. In other words, the time-weighted return shows the return on an investment, while the money-weighted return shows the return on your investment. For example, suppose you buy $ABC stock with $10,000 and, after six months, the stock falls 50%. At that time you put another $ 5,000 into the investment. The money-weighted return is based on when you put in the money. Suppose, in the next six months, $ABC stock rises by 100%. Since the stock fell 50%, it rose by 100% to break even, so the stock rose by 50% in one year and the return on the original $10,000 is also a 50% return. The return on the new $ 5,000 is also a return of 100%. The time-weighted return ignores when you put in the new money and just looks at the performance of $ABC stock, so the return on the total $15,000 is still zero, but the return on the $ 5,000 you put in is higher than zero. If you put in money regularly, the two weightings can produce very different numbers.
Logistical solutions are much better with large quantities. Say you have a component to ship. You load it on a truck and send it off. Except for the difference in fuel costs, it makes little difference whether you send one part or a whole truckload. The cost is almost the same. Large companies try to build their products to fit into a truck so that they can send as few shipments as possible.
The real idea behind the four-day work week is to divide the 40 or 50 hours of work into 4 days. This is to reduce fixed costs like getting to and from work, laundering your work clothes, etc. It has nothing to do with making less money or working less. Of course, this is only reasonable if your customers are open long enough to make it work. For example, if you deliver bread to restaurants, they all want it before 9 a.m. and before 3 p.m., and they want it seven days a week. That won’t work. So a four-day work week is not a solution for every kind of work.
Take the NYSE as an example. The stock market is made up of many “listed” stocks, which means that they are large enough to be on the stock market, have annual audited financial statements and pay an annual listing fee to the stock exchange. A listing is simply a right to trade on the stock exchange. The regular trading hours of the NYSE are 9:30 am to 4:00 pm (Eastern time). During those hours you can’t trade on the NYSE, but there are other venues where you can trade NYSE stocks. There are about thirty-five exchanges, dark pools, and ECNs in the US. An ECN is a market that doesn’t have any stocks listed on it; it only trades stocks that are listed on another exchange, such as the NYSE or NASDAQ. What I’m trying to say is that you don’t have to trade a NYSE-listed stock on the NYSE. You can trade it on BIDs, Arca, BATS, and Instinet. Another important thing to understand is that these ECNs don’t necessarily have the same hours as the NYSE. BATS, for example, is open from 8 am to 5 pm. That gives you a good hour and a half to trade there before the NYSE opens and another hour after it closes. So to answer your question, extended hours trading is simply the ability to trade stocks outside of the regular hours of the NYSE and NASDAQ by using a trading system that opens earlier and closes later than the regular markets.

No salary is not the same as no pay. Just because you don't get a salary doesn't mean you don't have an expense account or you don't receive dividends from your stock. Also, many of these people are already wealthy and have other sources of income from stocks, real estate, other business interests, etc., and not to mention cash in the bank. This is how they pay their bills while building up a company and a stock portfolio.
no. Rather, it is the transition from people working the land with hand tools to people working the land with massive machines. One farmer today can do the work of hundreds from only a few centuries ago.
They see money that goes down in value hour by hour and which has so little value that you get more heat by burning the money than from the wood you can buy with it. You can look at hyperinflation in Zimbabwe for a modern example or at hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic for an earlier example.
The interest rate is fixed between you and the bank. For most people, the interest rate will be higher on larger loans. The bank is taking more risk by lending you more money. In general, it is best to borrow the minimum necessary. Unless you have invested it in a business or some other profitable undertaking, it is not wise to carry a large amount of debt. We are not talking here of such things as a car or a home which are necessary for your occupation and your home life.
They don’t do it by breaking the law, they do it by following it. Congress passes laws for the privileged few and not the many because it helps them stay in power. The 1% simply uses those loopholes to dodge taxes. The IRS audits them constantly and finds them to be following the law. The IRS enforces laws, not justice.
If a significant part of the bills and kroner in circulation were suddenly destroyed, it would become harder to obtain kroner, and there are still many purchases, especially small ones, which are still in cash. If you cannot get cash, you can’t spend cash, and if you are unwilling or unable to switch to a digital transaction environment (eg a debit card), you will have far less contact with the economy. And then repeat this over and over and over again, and the economy slows down.
The streaming services have deals with the major record labels, like Sony, Universal and Warner, which give them a right to stream any of their music for a fee. The details of the contracts are usually secret and they’re renegotiated all the time, but some of the terms are usually leaked. The most common form of payment is a fixed sum per play. So every time you hit the play button, the artist gets a few cents. The record label takes this money and any other money it gets from the song’s distribution and divides it up according to the contract with the artist. Band members or their heirs can then get a cheque from the label once a month.
what prevents the selling of organs on the darknet? After all, that's where there's a lot of illegal trade, so it would be a perfect solution.
Norway has a national fund that it manages on behalf of its citizens. It is made up of stocks and other shares, some of which are in oil and shares. It has lately grown so big that it is worth more than a million to each citizen. But this is a national fund, and the individual citizens don’t actually get that money. So this is a bit of hyperbole. But it’s a pretty nice reserve fund for Norway. They are doing a lot for their people.
It’s because the Turkish lira is going downhill, it’s fallen 40 percent against the dollar, and almost as much against the euro, so if you look at the prices of imported goods and anything that’s bought in foreign currency it’s going up by 40 percent. Inflation is up by 40 percent, and the real issue is the cause of the collapse: the central bank, at the direction of the government, is lowering interest rates while the rate of inflation is rising. A: It’s quite the opposite of conventional monetary policy, in which the first policy in fighting inflation is to raise interest rates, and the only thing a central bank doesn’t do when inflation is rising is to lower them. But that’s what Turkey has been doing for the last few weeks. There’s not much faith in Turkey being able to fight inflation if the central bank continues on this course. And meanwhile, Turks themselves are increasingly trading lira for foreign currency and avoiding business done in lira. So the real issue is not the value of the lira against the euro, but how it got there and what’s being done about it. And the whole world thinks Turkey’s actions are basically the opposite of what’s needed.
Mid-level and senior managers get bonuses and promotions according to the profit they make. With more staff, more costs are made, resulting in lower bonuses for the managers.
Planning. Say you have to get 100 packages from ten trucks to every address in your city in one day. Now, not only do you have to pack these trucks to the best possible capacity but also find the best route for each truck. You want to use the least amount of gas and also deliver only during certain hours. This is already a difficult problem. And it's even harder to get something from point A to point B in a day. There are only so many airplanes and so many trucks that could do that. If the airplane isn't fully loaded, tough luck, the shipper still has to fly it. If the area doesn't have much deliveries, tough luck, a truck still has to go there. On the other hand, if the customer is paying less for “slow” delivery, the route planning is easier. If the airplanes coming from the originating point aren't full, you can wait a day or two to get a little more gas. If the truck going to that area isn't very full, it can wait another day or two to get more packages, which saves gas and driver time. This is why Amazon gives incentives to hold packages until “Amazon day”. If everyone in your area is letting their packages converge to be delivered on a certain day, Amazon needs less gas and fewer drivers than if everyone insisted on getting their package quickly. When you think about millions of packages, it all adds up! To summarize, the more time you give a shipper to deliver something, the more they can save on gas and drivers. It's not much more expensive to have a box in a warehouse, but it is more expensive if a driver has to go out of his way for ten minutes to make a delivery, or if a truck has to leave without a full load. Quicker delivery covers these losses by charging more.
Demand is always a very important factor in determining prices. When people are evicted, the people who lived there don’t disappear. More people looking for housing means more demand, and therefore higher prices. But consider what happens when you can’t evict people. You can’t really raise prices when you can’t evict people. And since rents were probably suppressed a bit during the moratorium, they are likely to rise again now. Besides, the landlords are also in business. They haven’t been making as much money as they should, and a raise on rent is a chance to make it up. Raising prices may even be necessary for them to make up their losses.
Color was capable of showing black and white as well as color. So the companies advertised their color capabilities and the sets were more expensive, but not unaffordable. (Prices when the color TV first debuted in 1953)
Equity is the difference between what you owe and what the property is actually worth on the current market. For example, if you owe $150,000 and the house is worth $225,000 on the current market, you have $100,000 in equity.
I’d bet that we’d see a drop in the quarterly profits of many corporations if they were required to pay the sales tax that’s really theirs to pay. A: No we wouldn’t. If they were required to pay sales tax, they’d simply raise the price of their products so the customer still paid the same price and the company made the same profit.
It can, but only if people want to sell. Like every other commodity, stocks can only be bought if someone wants to sell them. And corporations are legally treated as people. So when a company buys back its own shares, they don't belong to anyone, they belong to the company.
Easy, the cost to them per item is less than a dollar. So if you buy something worth 25 cents for a dollar, they make a profit.
Value is an equation between seller and buyer. Your house is worth what other houses in your neighborhood are worth. The process is complex and oblique. You can drive up the price of your car. But only certain cars and only if they are older. I own a nineteen-year-old porsche that I bought this year. For a time it was worth more than I paid for it, because it’s so hard to find either used or new cars. The same car was worth less last year.
That’s the basic premise. Think of the debt ceiling as a personal pledge not to borrow more than a certain amount—because that’s basically what it is. In our current political context, this is a silly game, because it comes down to this: I’m going to make $100,000 this year. I’m also going to spend $20,000 this year, so I’ll borrow an additional $10,000. That’s my budget (or spending bill). The debt ceiling is the limit to which I can borrow. So if I say, “I’m going to borrow $30,000 this year,” I’m just giving myself permission, it doesn’t mean someone is going to lend me $30,000 this year. The us government can, in theory, set any debt ceiling it wants, but it doesn’t mean that the bond market will lend them that much money, or that there won’t be consequences (though over the past few decades, there hasn’t been much problem borrowing money). The main question is what happens when they create money or borrow it. How will they spend it? Will it lead to higher interest rates? Does it cause inflation? Does it inflate asset bubbles?
The shops at the airport after the check-in usually have higher prices. They can do this because of two features of their customers: 1. They are stuck there. They cannot shop around. 2. They have usually enough money to buy a ticket and so they have enough money to pay for something a bit more expensive.
Depending on your priorities. It’s been suggested that if you invest the extra money, you can easily earn a better return than 3 percent. But if you make extra payments, it’s always a good idea to pay off your mortgage early. If not, you might be missing an opportunity to earn a better return. Is that how you see it?
This depends entirely on the terms of the loan covenants. Depending on the conditions of the loan, the company may be deemed in default of the loan.
In general: 1) Oil prices are high; 2) supply chains have not recovered from the downturn; there is a shortage of goods in the market; 3) Possibly people are emerging from their cash bind and seeking to spend more; 4) Many governments have been spending in an epidemic panic and have thus increased the money supply (although some are now beginning to rein it in again); 5) stock prices are high and may lure people into investing more. According to where you live, inflation has been low for a long time.
Back before 1990 most of the world's debt was denominated in the national currency of the country where the debt was issued. If I am an Indian oil refiner and want to borrow money for building a new refinery, I go to a bank and borrow Indian Rupees. If the government of Vietnam needs to build a highway, they borrow in their own currency, the Dong (no they don't cut people's penises off, it's their currency). The trouble is that most of the lenders to countries outside of the US, Europe, and Japan are themselves the lenders, and since most of the borrowers are very corrupt, what happens when the government of Vietnam can't afford to pay back the loan? They just print more and more Dong to pay back their loan. But with the value of the Dong falling as a result of printing so many, the lenders are stuck with a pile of worthless currency. So the lenders of the US, Europe, and Japan made a deal that countries outside of their regions would have to pay back their loans in their own currency. It doesn't matter how much the government of Vietnam devalues their currency, they still have to pay back the same amount of dollars. Most of the debts of companies and countries are denominated in 20 or 30 year bonds. The interest on the bonds is paid back annually. So if I borrow $100 and pay it back in 20 years at an interest rate of 1%, I pay back a dollar a year on the $100 (1% of $100). But when the loan comes due after 20 years, the original loan is paid back in full, with the interest. At the end of year 20, I have to pay back $11 which includes the original $100 plus the last year's interest. So when it comes to paying back the loan in year 20, I have to pay back the debt with 101 times as many dollars as I paid back in year 19. So when the time comes to pay back the loan, there is a sudden increase in demand for USD from companies and countries. The Evergrande situation is a perfect example of this. Evergrande has to pay back a large amount of bonds that mature in the next 20 to 30 years. They have enough in hard assets to pay back these bonds (they own a lot of land and buildings), but since they cannot transfer the land to the lenders because of Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of land, they need to sell the land and convert the USD into debt payment. But with the large increase in demand for so many dollars at one time, it is difficult to find people who have so many dollars at one time.
This is something I haven’t been able to work out, but it may be because most people are different from me and prefer not to move around so often. The moving costs probably equal or exceed six weeks of rent, not to mention the fuss.
A great many governments in Europe have been pursuing a policy for the last ten years of reducing the number of coal and nuclear power stations. And they have been relying on the market to come up with some sensible alternatives. This has resulted in a great many new investments in wind and solar power, but has made little provision for securing an adequate supply of electricity. In late summer, when it was hot and there was little wind, the solar panels overheated and the windmills did not produce electricity. And with everybody turning up their air-conditioners, supplies were insufficient. In consequence, the governments insisted on keeping gas-fired power stations in operation and even building some new ones. But due to political problems in eastern Europe, between Russia and its western neighbours, the gas to run these stations has not been coming in. And the winter’s supply has already been drained before autumn has even arrived. The same goes for hydro-power. The water levels in the reservoirs are at a record low.
The interest that banks receive is a huge source of income for them. Reducing interest is good for everyone but these companies and the politicians who receive their donations.
The exchange rate is, literally, the average price in one currency which people are willing to pay for another.
The United States was founded on the mythos of the rugged individual, the man who would go to the "frontier" to settle the land and create civilization. People who believe in the power of the individual to overcome all obstacles also tend to believe that they will survive in apocalyptic times if they have been properly prepared. So they buy or build bunkers, and stock them with the food, water, and supplies they think they will need when society collapses.
Australian malls are basically superstores plus department stores. All major malls have at least one each of: Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, Kmart, Target, Myer, David Jones, JB HI-Fi. I don’t think this is the case in the US. In the presence of superstores, other shops in the malls in Australia get a guaranteed minimum footfall just from being in the vicinity of the superstore, and this turns into a minimum of extra sales to make them viable.
The Conservative Party of Canada was founded in 1867, and was the first to be elected, with its leader John A. Macdonald as the first prime minister. But the party you see today isn't the same party. It was renamed the "Progressive Conservative Party of Canada" in 1941 in an attempt to entice more liberals and progressives to join it. But this name is infamously an oxymoron: How can there be a "Progressive Conservative"? It's a contradiction in terms. Over the next fifty years, it was only elected to power a few times, while the Liberal Party ruled for the most part under Pierre Trudeau, the longest-serving prime minister. The party was always a scandal-ridden party when it was in power: First under John Diefenbaker and the infamous Avro Arrow scandal, then under Joe Clark, who lasted less than a year before he was overthrown by Trudeau, who was re-elected. Then came Brian Mulroney, a version of our own version of Ronald Reagan. During his time in office, Canada suffered its worst economic slump since World War II, unemployment rose to the highest level since the Great Depression, the federal government faced long-term deficits, the Tories introduced a much-hated tax, the goods and services tax (GST), and the country was awash with scandals of a government in disarray, such as the Airbus affair, and there were charges of government mismanagement in the Somalia inquiry. In the election campaign, the Conservatives used an attack ad against the Liberal leader Jean Chrétien, which appeared to mock his strange facial expressions caused by Bell's palsy and claim he was unfit for the position of prime minister because of it. He served two terms, and then resigned in disgrace to be replaced by our only female prime minister to date, Kim Campbell. Campbell served less than six months as prime minister before she was wiped out in the election, with the Conservatives going from a majority to two seats in the next election, a defeat from which the party arguably never recovered. The Canadian right then splintered into various factions, including the Reform Party of Preston Manning, the extreme right-wing party (but still less right-wing than the American Republicans). The Reform Party was after several years virtually irrelevant, because of the split between the Tories and the Bloc Quebecois, merged with the Conservatives and chose the unfortunate name of the "Canadian Conservative Alliance Party" (CCRAP)—yes, Crap, the Canadian version. They soon changed it to the "Canadian Alliance Party" and then to the much more obvious "Conservative Party of Canada". It was under this name that they were elected to power and remained there for three terms, with Stephen Harper as prime minister.
I’m not sure what you consider to be “good,” but the government controls the dollar strategically. Inflation is a deliberate tool for accelerating economic growth, it encourages people to invest instead of merely hoard money.
Because the price of the first thing has gone up, probably due to a change in the supply and demand. That is something quite apart from what you mentioned as far as your business expenses are concerned.
The main reason is that cable companies generally only get rights to the services in their own footprint. This is part of the bargaining with the content companies. It also helps that they only have to buy the rights to the local channels in their areas, not in every place in the country. Dish and other pure OTT services like Fubo, for example, get national rights, and can buy local channels everywhere. This is changing, and you will soon see cable companies get national rights and local rights in more places to launch streaming. It is not easy.
Not an economist, but: if the economy has been so badly messed up by people pursuing their own interests, like, for example, pre-revolutionary Russia, then a state-run economy can restore some semblance of efficiency. But, in the long run, it seems like including a large element of the free market into your economy can actually be more efficient and can lead to greater growth and development. In fact, there is almost no such thing as a completely state-run economy, and those that are are horrendous; but then neither are there any economies that are completely free market economies. The problem is determining how much state intervention in an otherwise free market economy is appropriate. Or, from the other end, in the case of Cuba for example, how much free market in a state-run economy.
Riches give you options on how to receive your money, and those options are taxed at different rates. Many of these options are not even available to those who are not so rich, or are not even desirable for those who are not so rich. For example, you might have a million dollars. You could go to the bank and borrow one million of it, putting your one million dollars as collateral, which any bank on earth would gladly do. Then you could use that loan to pay for your living expenses. Because loans are not taxable, you would pay no income tax on that loan. Next year, you could go to the bank again and ask for a two-million-dollar loan, one million to pay off the previous loan, and another million to live on this year. And again, the bank would say yes, because your million is more than enough collateral. And in the meantime, that million has increased to $1.1 million, which is even more. So for a whole year, you've lived, paid your bills, and earned exactly zero dollars in income. And you can do this for your whole life, and you'll pay virtually no income tax at all. But that option is not available to people like you and me.
It is transparent, but it is anonymous. Humans are just wallet addresses in the eyes of the blockchain. If you don’t use the same address more than once, no one knows it is you. To spend a coin, you have to prove when you received it and that you didn’t spend it in any other transaction (hence the need for all transactions to be transparent). Then you can have smart contracts where you put a hash on the chain that doesn’t reveal anything about the contents, but can be used to verify that the contract hasn’t changed.
When you make a transaction, it is registered on the public chain so that everyone knows that your address balance has changed. You can put some code there to enable some transactions only when certain conditions are met. These conditions may be waiting a certain time or sending another transaction. The more you use smart contracts, the more like a bank you become, and the less you need to depend on a monopoly for trust. For example, if you want to exchange ETH for BTC, but you don’t trust the other person to send you your part, you can send your part as a smart contract, and only when the other person’s transaction has been sent, your smart contract will execute.
As in a universal currency for the whole world? It would simplify some things, but it would also bring problems. The most important would be who gets to control the supply, i.e. how much money there is.
Human factors and ergonomics are an extremely useful field to address the question you posed. If your study has any implications for government regulations, policies, or laws, you can show how your findings relate to, change, or address gaps in these areas. As part of your research, are there any laws, regulations, or policies that relate to current or proposed state or federal policies? Your findings can also be used to make recommendations to change, add, or remove laws governing the topic on which your study is focused. Here is an example of a human factors diagram that may be useful to you. https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Human-Factors-Analysis-and-Classification-System-STAMP-HFACS-S-Analysis-of-Errors-and-Safety-Measures-for-Errors-and-Safety-Measures-for-Safety-Measures-and-Metrics-Process-STAMP-Hfacs-system-for-analyzing-errors-and-s-system-for-analyzing-human-errors-and-safety-errors-and-safety-factors-for-the-driving-of-errors-and-the-s-system-for-preventing-such-errors-and-reducing-the-stress-on-such-s-factors-(https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Human-Factors-Analysis-and-Classification-System-STAMP-HFACS-S-classifications-and-the-s-factors-for-the-system-for-driving-of-errors-and-reducing-the-stress-on-such-systems-s-s-s-s- and-for-the-s-embs-s-t-s-s3-Henry-hfacs-An-3-Dy-Facs-An-3-D-D-P-D-S-D-Brad-HFAC-S-S-Frame-STAMP-Hacs-S-.svg-s-and-s-bs-sy-hfacs-s-n-d-w
Less bureaucracy, unified legal/economic/banking system, unified foreign policy. These advantages are the same (with a different name and scale) in the debate on the UK leaving the EU or, if you want to open this can of worms, in comparing the US with the EU. But what are the disadvantages? : Psyll.
A number of factors, really. Interest rates are low right now, so you can borrow more for a mortgage. So the house prices can go up and up, and as the demand is high, the prices can go up even higher. People know they can borrow more, and since there is more demand than supply, people pay what they can afford. And because interest rates are low, it’s no longer worth keeping the money in the bank. This means that people who have money to invest buy houses to rent them out. This reduces the supply, and pushes up the price even more. The price of a house is determined by the cost of materials. There isn’t a huge difference between the cost of a large house and a smaller, less extravagant one. As the demand is high, and you can borrow more, many of the building companies are concentrating on the more luxurious houses. There is less competition for the smaller, less luxurious ones, and so the prices for those are even higher. There are probably lots of other factors, but there isn’t one single reason. It all adds up.

The goal is to pour money into the economy by going through the banks. The banks then are supposed to give out loans and put money into their own local communities, by investing in businesses that will hire people, or paying for things to be built that will employ people.
To default on debt means not to pay money that you have borrowed when you promised to do so. It’s sort of like not paying back a bank loan, except that governments usually borrow money differently from people. Instead of going to a bank and borrowing money, they issue bonds, which are promises to pay back the money with interest at a certain date in the future. Government bonds are considered very safe, because governments always pay back their debts. So, since they’re safe, the government can pay a very low interest rate on them, which gives governments a low-interest way to borrow money and gives people a very safe way to invest their money. If the government were to default and not pay back its bonds when they were due, then the bonds would lose their safe reputation, and the people who bought them would want a higher interest rate to make up for the greater risk. So if the government were to default, the interest rate it would have to pay on future borrowings would rise. The debt ceiling is a limit on how much the government can borrow. It’s a political invention and was originally intended to be a way to control government borrowing, but it has become just another political tool for playing games. Other countries don’t have anything like the debt ceiling—they just pass a budget, and the budget is presumed to include all borrowing needed to meet expenses. But then, in most countries, if the budget doesn’t pass, then there’s an automatic election for a new government.
The Ecu is an example of the prevailing trend in the world today. Several countries have wanted to adopt the U.S. dollar as their currency, but the U.S. Treasury has rebuffed them, because they did not want to print a lot of paper money for them.
There have been suggestions to send each American a bill with the sum to be paid. Then you pay it, or you take various deductions to lower the sum, and pay the lower amount. [A proposal that was successfully lobbied against by H & R Block and other tax advisers. (see: https://www.propublica.org/article/filing-taxes-could-be-free-simple-hr-block-intuit-lobbying-against-it)
why are there so many millionaires in politics? The answer is they don't get away with anything. They have financial advisers and tax advisors who take advantage of all the legal possibilities in taxation. This is the question.
The issue of what happens to money depends on the organization, its structure, and so on. But the problem in the main consists of budgets. For example, if you say to your boss that you need ten million yen to work on a project for the year, but only spend eight million yen, nothing happens to that two million. But if you ask for money the following year, the company will say, “Since you've only spent eight million, that's all you'll get.” Even if you're allowed to carry over the two million, you're still working with eight million. The next year, too, you'll find yourself working with two million less. Instead, it's better to use that money right away and show the company that you've spent the whole ten million. In future, you'll be able to ask for ten million each year.
Airline companies can generally calculate pretty accurately when they will have sufficient tickets sold to fill their planes to almost capacity, and having to pay for a few overbooked seats is a small part of the overall business. Also competition can play a role: if an airliner increases its price too much, a customer may choose to fly on another carrier flying the same route for a lower price.
Things are valuable when they are scarce and people want them. If one of these two factors changes, the value of the thing changes. For example, let's say there are only ten first-edition, signed copies of Stephen King's The Stand in the world. Stephen King is a famous writer with many dedicated fans, so these books are worth a lot. They are rare and in great demand. But then let's say Stephen King finds a box in his basement containing one thousand first-edition, signed copies that he printed years ago, and he starts selling them. The original ten books aren't worth as much anymore because they aren't as rare and people who want them have a lot more to choose from. These ten books that were once worth $ 1,000 each are now worth less than $ 100 each. Now let's say that Stephen King is caught doing horrible things to puppies, and so now a lot of people aren't such big fans of his and the value of the ten signed copies goes down because people aren't as interested in them. People don't want to pay $ 1,000 for a rare book from a guy who tortures puppies. A few people might still want them, but not as much. Doesn't that make sense, that things are only valuable when they are scarce and people want them? Money works the same way. If there are more of a certain kind of money, it's less rare and its value goes down. (Even if you don't tell people what you're doing, people will still notice the effects after a while.) Also, when a country starts printing a lot of money, other countries lose confidence in it because they see it as a sign of instability and don't want to do business with it as much. Then their currency is worth less. (It's like if you change the rules in the middle of a game with someone. They are less likely to want to play with you.) It's a bit of a simplification, but I hope it helps.
* Not an economist, but from a very high level, it's a few things. * Europe is highly regulated and expensive and very fragmented, and it's hard to start a new disruptive business there. * Europe has always been a financial center, especially the UK, but Brexit and the world moving towards Asia has gradually made this advantage and growth area smaller. * Europe excels in traditional high-tech research (medicine, physics, etc.), but it lags behind in IT and software, and this has been a big driving force for US growth recently. * It is also reasonable to say that the US stock market is overvalued / in a bubble fueled by technology and low interest rates, and that some of the growth is speculative and artificial.
It's because the problem of production shortages is a world problem. The same chips shortage that leads to a delay in new cars and home appliances is everywhere. The delay in transportation from the port to the store is everywhere, but when a ship is delayed in one port, it is delayed in the following port too.
I've never expected my cashier to thank me. That just seems like a sign of entitlement, doesn't it?
But it depends on how the taxes are spent. For example, if you raise taxes on the rich and use the extra money to finance wars or rehabilitate banks, then the lower classes will not see much of the result. But on the whole it would be better. The main advantage of taxation is that it benefits all the same way. Everyone uses the roads, everyone goes to school, everyone benefits if these institutions are reformed.
Exactly. We cannot create money on demand. Gold is completely useless except for very special uses in electricity. It cannot be eaten or burned. Why should we care about it? Because it is rare. It is a rare thing, and that is what makes it interesting to our mind. If there were an infinite amount of gold, no one would care. It's the same with money. Money only has value as long as it is scarce. If everyone has an infinite amount of money, it's an infinitely large amount of money. Then you have a hyperinflation, so the prices go up, because why ask for 2 units of the money for the bread when you can ask for 200? Then 200 units are worth what two were worth before. We cannot create money on demand, because it must be kept relatively stable.
The government says that it's spending this much money on that. And the Smithsonian gets a billion from the government because it is the government.
Mostly trust. And also the fear of a criminal prosecution if they were to steal cards. There have been several cases of skimming from fast food places.
They're called 'play-to-earn' games. They're not called 'play-to-earn rich.' They aren't meant to make you rich. They're meant to make their developers rich. They promise you a fun game, good graphics, or the chance to become rich—whether that chance is real or not isn't the point. The vast majority of 'play-to-earn' games die in their infancy, while a small number survive (like the aforementioned Entropia Universe). Things only have value when other people want them. If everyone plays a game to make money, then the items earned inside the game have only speculative value, and it's just an investors' bubble, which bursts when everyone realizes that no one will actually buy the items. * * * For example, housing bubbles. * * *
PINs are used precisely for this reason, but because the majority of terminals used by merchants do not have the means of entering text except with a numeric keypad, it would be very difficult to enter long strings of characters. On the other hand, the merchant may ask for a document at any time as he is entitled to under the agreement with the card companies.
This is what I do, so I can explain it, but I’m not sure I can explain it like you’re five. Here’s a try: we help companies so they don’t do anything stupid with their money, either in the present or in the future.
Several reasons (very generally speaking) are peculiar to Japan: 1) Japan is generally not a nation that welcomes or encourages migration. 2) Japan is experiencing population decline. 3) Japan has a relatively high standard of living. It is difficult to find jobs in the country that pay as well as city jobs. 4) Japan’s work culture does not support the concept of working at home. Office hours are generally brutal, and seniority is highly valued. Large corporations are more common than small businesses and independent freelancers. 5) The Japanese banking system is dominated by men and older people. It is difficult for young people to obtain loans or capital. This is not just a Japanese problem. In Italy, many towns are giving away free houses. Young people who are willing to work for less money and endure hard labor can bring big changes to a region. Rural land is not worthless; it is simply a matter of a lack of demand for economically unproductive land, where modern conveniences are lacking.
Some get a percentage of the income, but most get a fixed amount, with extra bonuses after three months. Then there are also residuals, which go to the actors and continue to be paid after each movie and for each time interval. But thanks to the accounting in Hollywood, if a movie makes $200,000,000, the producers and the studio will find a way to use that money before the residuals come in. That means that it is only the money after three months that is actually shared by those who worked on the film beyond their salary and other contracts.
because it is more printed, so each yen is not as valuable. But it’s only a matter of how you number things. You could just forget about the “dollar” and pay for a coffee in cents, then the difference would not be so great. Or you could just add five zeros to the end of all bills; it’s the same money, just bigger numbers. The numbers alone don’t tell you anything about how “strong” a currency is. For that you have to compare the buying power too. How much you can buy with the money.
Thanks to the COVIDs. The economy is short of almost everything—vegetables, meat, plastics, cardboard boxes, truck drivers, and workers. Prices fluctuate accordingly. Low supply, but high demand. Prices rise. Rising prices are inflation.
It’s not an absolute. Appraisals can have a ten percent error margin. But you can always get a few and then they will get closer to the real market value. Now it’s also unusual because there’s so much more demand for owning a home in the lower and middle classes. So there aren’t enough houses for everyone, so prices are going up a bit because of scarcity. And a good appraiser will take that into consideration.
There is no law that prevents multiple taxation. And the state taxes local governments with the sales tax, and you have not mentioned the property tax. Many people who pay sales taxes have little income or none at all because they work informally and have no official income. The people who save a lot are rewarded by paying a lower percentage of the tax on their income.
Having a website that is capable of processing ticket sales seems like a straightforward task. The first reason isn’t that they’re afraid of extreme load spikes when tickets go on sale. Even Ticketmaster has problems with their servers when hot tickets go on sale. However, even if they could build their own ticketing system, artists and managers would rather not deal with dozens of venues. For them it is simpler to deal with one ticketing system for all 50 dates on their tour.
The key word in this is “expected.” What is your expected return? The only person who can answer that question is you, since it comes down to what you expect. What is your expected inflation rate in the near future? What are your expected tax rates on your expected profits? What are your expected earnings of your broker, bank, insurance company, real estate agency, or lawyer? All these are unknowns.
- Several reasons: - Shareholders want to see growth, not customer satisfaction ratings - If you've already got a customer, it's quite likely they checked out the competition and picked you because you're the best - you don't have to worry about improving your offer unless the competition does. - Changing suppliers can be a nuisance. Unless they completely screw up, customers are unlikely to go through the bother of changing. They'll just accept mediocrity.
The UK's economy was *extremely* integrated with the rest of the EU. When it left the EU, it did not exactly find a way to replace the parts of the UK economy that relied on the EU, especially the supply chains. Because of COVID, the supply chains are already overextended, and many manufacturers are now diverting their goods and services into the US market because the United States is recovering from the post-COVID depression and can pay a premium for goods and services. But the main cause is Brexit. Northern Ireland is doing surprisingly well because it is still effectively part of the EEZ.
Basically because it eats away at the people’s income. When the fuel gets more expensive, it means people have less money for other things that they feel are more important. Compared to the current high prices, even a small rise can have a psychological effect. This is, of course, not good for the economy as a whole, both from the consumers’ point of view (they buy less) and from the suppliers’ point of view (they must pay more to produce).
It's just what it says on the tin. With the development of the forecasting tools comes the necessity of producing and distributing goods in a new way, but the powers-that-be always try to keep things the way they are, because people are stuck in their ways, even the rich ones. The theory of opposites, but in a social and economic sense.
Mainly from the food and soft drinks, which are highly marked up. When I was young, I managed a Speedway station and we lost money on the gas but made a lot of money on the food and drinks.
The market is not collapsing. It is simply changing hands from those without money to those with. Houses are bought up by companies. Houses are also bought up by people with such incomes. People with no money are losing their houses and moving into rentals or back home. Those who in theory would be buying their own house are staying with their parents or renting. Essentially the market is being held up. Zillow bought so many houses last year they don’t know what to do with them. Zillow often overpaid for houses and now they have an excess of stock.

Earning interest on interest. Here’s an example: Assume you earn 5 percent on your savings. In the first year you save $100 and earn five dollars in interest. In the second year, you earn 5 percent on the first $100, so you have $105 in savings. In the third year, you earn 5 percent on $115.76, and so on.
The value of an NFT comes *ENTIRELY* from idiots who are willing to pay for NFTs. It's all about the concept that your copy of an infinitely available thing is unique. It's basically paying for bragging rights. Yes, you have the same exact picture as I do, but I've paid a lot of money to be able to say I paid a lot of money for my copy. So, basically, it's just a trade. NFTs are a bubble, and it's inevitable that this bubble will burst. Your goal as an NFT trader is to buy low and sell high to someone else, and get out before there aren't any more idiots willing to pay a premium.
Banks don't create currency – it comes from somewhere, even if it's not in the form of actual money. The Federal Government controls the total amount of currency in circulation – it can essentially “print” more of it.
I’ve worked in the insurance business, I’ve sold policies, I’ve done medical billing, and I’ve collected reimbursements. Here’s how it usually works: you have a monthly payment that you may or may not have to pay on top of your salary. That’s your out-of-pocket cost. Then you have a deductible and a maximum out-of-pocket cost. It goes like this: If you have a high-deductible policy, your deductible could be up to $3,500. Or you could have a plan with a lower monthly cost and a lower deductible. Once you reach your deductible, your insurance starts paying for your medical bills. Then you pay a certain percentage of the bill—say, 80%—and you’re responsible for the other 20%. That’s how it works until you reach your maximum out-of-pocket cost, which could be up to $10,000. That’s for one person. The deductible and out-of-pocket costs for a family are much higher. Now, having dealt with the criminal enterprises known as insurance companies—from the provider’s point of view, trying to get reimbursed for the services I’d provided—I’ve seen companies deliberately violate their contracts, knowing that no one can afford to sue them. The insurance industry is ripe for a series of multibillion-dollar lawsuits. They deserve to be sued out of existence for the daily contract violations they commit. The provider I worked for had to write off tens of thousands of dollars every year because the companies wouldn’t pay or would pay only part of the bill. The provider’s lawyers sent a letter to one large insurance company, saying they owed the provider more than $386,000 because of what they’d paid. That’s just one company and one provider.
A country’s system is used to write numbers in each country. In Switzerland we use an apostrophe to indicate the grouping of digits, a full point to indicate the decimal point and the currency sign after the number. 1’234’567.89 francs.
The value of a stock is what those who want the stock are willing to pay, and the owners of the stock are willing to sell it for. If lots of people think the company is worth more than its share price, then they will buy stocks, and that will raise the stock price. And if lots of people think the stock price is too high, they will sell the stocks they own, and the stock price will fall. A stockholder buying a controlling share in a company without the approval of the current board is called a hostile takeover.
Buying the house means you can sell it. All the money you put into a mortgage will be recouped when you sell. Renting means all the money you put into the rent will go to the landlord and you'll never see it again. The property taxes are not that much. A couple of thousand dollars a year. It's a drop in the bucket compared to the profit you make when you sell.
Cash out means you're refinancing the existing loan plus a certain amount of money, and you get a check for the difference at closing. No cash out means you're refinancing the outstanding loan balance only. If you need to pay other high-interest debt, cashing out makes sense, if not, don't.
Business equity in a franchise is a franchiser's share in the company, that is to say, the amount you own of the company is one-fifth. If the company is valued at $500,000, then your business equity is worth $100,000. But since business equity is a fixed proportion of the company's value, the value of your business equity will increase as the company grows. In 10 years, the company's value will increase to $1 billion. Your business equity, if you still have 20%, is worth $2 billion.
You have a dollar, and I promise you I’ll get you two for it if you give me that dollar, so you give me a dollar. Two other people hear you’re going to double your money, and they each give me a dollar. I now have three, and give you two. I’m now in the red, and I start to panic, because I haven’t been able to keep up with the new money coming in, and so I end up just disappearing with all the money.
Inflation happens because the money supply grows. In the old days, when money was gold and silver, this happened because more gold and silver were taken out of the ground and changed into more coins. Nowadays, inflation is controlled, because central banks can increase or decrease the supply of money in a controlled manner. It’s a good thing to have a little bit of inflation because it makes people spend more. If you had the same buying power today as you did next year, why would you buy a new TV right now when you could use your old one and then buy a new one next year? The people working at the TV factory, for example, need to sell the new TVs this year so that they get paid. If you wait until next year, they’ll be fired. The worst case is deflation, which is when the money supply shrinks. A smaller money supply makes money worth more with each passing year. In this case, people don’t buy anything except for the bare necessities. Why buy a new TV this year if it will be cheaper next year?
Suppose I want to buy a new, beautiful toilet, which is a toilet with gold plating and diamond studs and it costs a million. No problem, I sell shares! But wait, I have to pay taxes, I'm in the 37% tax bracket, so I'd have to sell $ 1,600,000. Or, what if I borrow a million for ten years, I'll have to pay it back, but that can wait until later. Fortunately, I have $ 1 billion in stocks, I can put some up for collateral, so the bank can almost be sure that they'll get their money back, so they can lend me some really stupid interest rate like a dollar a year. So for ten years I pay only $107,750 a year on my loan and pay back a total of $1,080,000 plus $ 77,498 in interest. That's 1,600,000 I wouldn't have gotten anyway, if I'd sold my stock and given it to the toilet shop. That means I'm saving $ 15,500 the first year, which goes up every year. I can still sell a few shares and pay back the loan, and then let the rest go on growing, and in the tenth year I'm still saving $ 20,553 and going up from there.
If you had a big grocery store with many departments, such as meat, fish, fruit, paper, etc., then each department would be a separate division of the company. Everything is sold at the same cash register, and the stock-boys fill the shelves, regardless of what is being sold. Now you buy a delicatessen in the next town, you own it and let someone else run it for you. If someone buys a loaf of bread in the delicatessen, he pays for it there, not in your store. The delicatessen and the grocery store could have different insurance companies, sell different soft drinks, etc., and you, the "company," own both of them as a separate business.
The vast majority of the cost of gas is derived from the source: the price of oil on the world market. If oil prices go up, so do gas prices. Oil prices have been steadily rising for the last year. Now, oil production is a little down, and as demand goes up, supply is expected to go up as well, bringing prices down.
Very, very briefly: A number of new financial products made it a lot less risky to lend money to someone who wanted to buy a house. Ordinarily, one lender has to deal with the risk that the borrower will not pay. But if you, as it were, chop up a lot of mortgage loans and make a new contract, then all the lenders are responsible for that risk. You sell a small part of each of these loans to others. Even if a few people do not pay, this new contract will still pay out (mostly). You are less exposed to a single borrower's nonpayment. But since these new contracts can also be sold, the bank that issues the original loan actually has nothing to do with the borrower's ability to pay. So it became very tempting for the banks to lend to people. People who could not really pay got cheap loans. And then they started not paying. So many of them that the new contract became worthless. Since a lot of people and institutions had bought these new contracts, a lot of people lost money. That caused a great shock in the financial system, which became the financial crisis. In a word, the housing bubble was a bubble in the housing market. The new loan products made it so the banks were very willing to lend to people who could not really afford it. A lot of these people could not pay because they weren't liable to pay. They should not have been able to borrow so much. People had to leave their homes because they could not afford it.
A share represents a portion of ownership in the company. It can be quite a large slice, say a third of the company, or it can be quite small, such as one-billionth, in the case of very large companies. But since different companies make different amounts of money, it’s obvious that one billionth of the tiny deli is probably worth much less than one billionth of the company, which makes a lot of money. Even if we assume that a millionth of the deli is worth much less than a billionth of the company, it’s still clear that the smaller slice of the company will still make more money than the larger slice of the deli. It all comes down to earnings per share. A company with low profits, but many shares, will naturally have a low share price. But a company with high profits and fewer shares will have a higher share price. Earnings per share gives us a rough idea of the value of a share. As a rule of thumb, you can take the EPS and multiply it by 20 to get an estimate of the share price.
My understanding is that it is the result of a surge in demand at a time when both coal and labor shortages have already been a problem. The combination of stimulus checks and the reopening of the American economy has resulted in an enormous increase in the demand for goods. Goods that, as a nation, we are having trouble getting to you. I heard from a few economists that you might get a roast beef instead of a turkey on the Fourth of July, or a pair of Adidas instead of a pair of Nikes on Christmas Day. You may not be able to get exactly what you want, but it’s really no big deal as far as the essentials are concerned. Gas will be more expensive—which means that everything will be, to some extent, and that’s called inflation. Don’t panic buy, and if you wait until Christmas Eve to buy the kids’ gifts, well, that’s just asking for trouble. It’s possible that you might end up buying them whatever’s left at the drugstore.
Because private health care is simply better. If you can afford it, you'll get treated faster, with better equipment, more efficiently, and you'll be able to get the treatments that, for example, the National Health Service doesn't cover. Private health care companies take pains to ensure the quality of their service is higher than the national health service in order to get more customers. So, the answer is faster, better equipment, no waiting lists.
the Managing Director of a larger company spends a lot of time with shareholders, with governments and with the public. He or she determines the identity of the company, and which projects correspond to this identity, and both long-term and short-term goals. The Managing Director is the direct supervisor of the top management. Then, in an ideal case, the Managing Director will anticipate problems and prevent them, or in an emergency, react and solve them. For example, when Steve Jobs became the Managing Director of Apple again, he analyzed all the projects and canceled a lot of them. He centered the company on his vision of the PC as a digital control center for digital devices. He then sold this vision to the outside world and to his own colleagues. He also made sure that design and development worked together and not in a haphazard way. Edit: a few people have commented that Steve was not a typical Managing Director. It is true that Steve was more daring, more creative and more successful than 99% of Managing Directors. But in general, his work was very successful and should be followed as much as possible by other Managing Directors. Except for the decision not to have an early operation. That was a bad decision. If you want to know what a bad Managing Director does, that's a different question, and there are lots of answers to that question. There are lots of ways to destroy a company. There are also lots of good Managing Directors, who may lack Steve's creativity and his willingness to risk, but who can keep a company running for many years in a well-functioning way. Several such Managing Directors in a row, however, lead to an ossification of the company and its inability to anticipate radical changes in the market. At this point, a Managing Director like Steve may legally steal your ideas, your best employees and your customers. Isn't that what Xerox did?
The value of money is a wilful thing. In essence, money is only worth what people think it is worth. There are a lot of reasons why a currency rises or falls. Political scandals, illegal trade and social issues are the most common ones.
In essence, caste is the status one is born into, and one cannot change it. Modern class systems are based on wealth, and it is possible to change class when your circumstances change.
You can ask for your hospital bill to be itemized, and you should. You'll probably get it lowered if you do.
Have you ever heard of daylight tax? That means the tax was based on the number of windows in your house. Many people in the UK bricked in their windows to avoid paying tax. (You can see some examples on this site: http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/townscountries/tyne-and-wear-case-study/aboutthegroup/housing/window-tax/)
They rely on investors. These are fast-growing companies, which claim that their losses are part of the investment that will pay off in the future. This tactic appears to have worked for Amazon for years.
Mostly by investing in things that benefit from the whole pandemic situation. The most extreme example is Jeff Bezos. His business made an enormous profit because people couldn’t go to normal shops and instead ordered everything on the Internet. Then there were big government bailouts for threatened companies that went directly to the shareholders.
Principal hires an agent. The agent works for the principal’s benefit, but sometimes the principal is harmed as well. The agent benefits from this. To solve this problem, the agent must be given better incentives.
Demand and supply. People want to live in California. It’s a great place to live. Better weather, more opportunity, beautiful people. California has everything: lots of restaurants, good schools, choice in everything. And people are willing to pay more to live there. Basically, that’s why.
The value of money (like everything else) depends on supply and demand. If money gradually increases (which is done on purpose), it must naturally become less valuable, because the value of the goods remains the same (or grows slower than the value of money). Why, you ask, do we want to cause inflation by printing money on purpose? – Because the alternative is much worse. A strong currency has caused many problems throughout history, because if the supply of money does not rise as fast as the demand, then it becomes more valuable (deflation). And then it becomes a profitable investment to hide the money in the locker (which causes even more deflation, because the circulation of money is reduced). And if no one invests the money, the economy stagnates.
It devalues the already circulating money. Exchange rates would go up, meaning you get more dollars for your euros or pounds. On the plus side, you’d get more tourists, since everything would be cheaper in the US compared to their country.
If more people are employed, they have more disposable income, which they can spend on restaurants, clubs, bars, clothes, etc. More profits in the places they spend their money can lead to higher wages for the workers, which they can spend. More employees mean the government has less to spend on welfare and more to tax. This means it can avoid raising the value-added tax or other taxes. Higher employment is good for the economy.
Because the stock market is not the economy. In fact, they are less and less linked. Economic indicators are unemployment, the median salary, wage growth, job creation.
Two ways. One is that they take the premiums and reinvest them in the company. They hope the profits on the investments will offset the cost of the insurance they pay out. Two is that a lot of life insurance is time-limited, so if you don’t die within the term of the policy, you don’t get anything (because you’re still alive), and they keep the premiums you’ve paid.
A second mortgage is a loan or a claim made on a property which already has a loan or a claim. A house worth $ 500,000 may have a mortgage of $200,000; then you can get a second mortgage for $100,000 and you now owe $300,000 on your $500,000. As to why people do it, it’s because they need a lot of money for something. Maybe they want to send their child to college, start a new business, pay a major bill, renovate the kitchen, etc. A second mortgage is a way of withdrawing the value of your home for your immediate needs.
It varies. The states pay for some roads and the federal government pays for others. But note that an interstate doesn't have to go across state lines. Because it meets federal standards for receiving federal help, Hawaii's highways are designated as interstates. If the road isn't one of those, it's probably paid for entirely by the state.
Not enough housing in the upscale neighborhoods to meet the demand. Not enough profit to build more houses to meet the demand. The cities are getting more and more populated, and the only place where you can find decent or higher paid work. The amount of houses is taken by multiple (decent) income sources, such as roommates, or in the case of a single room, a high level of student loans, or by many students who have many tens of thousands of yuan to spare. It is not beneficial for landlords to rent it for less than the price. Many landlords have been experiencing a shortage of rent for months or years and cannot afford to evict tenants, and they will screen tenants by their ability to pay more. The above is all the relevant factors.
A banking product is basically a contract. It requires some parties to do certain things at certain times, usually transfer something. The simplest example is the non-interest loan. I give you money, and you must pay me the same amount after a certain time. The main thing the bank does is to come up with more complicated contracts that are more attractive to the lender, the borrower or preferably both. Usually, when buying a financial product, you buy the rights that remain in the contract. Suppose I lend money to my friend. You can "buy" the loan from me by giving me money now, and then my friend will pay you instead of me. Basically, you just delete my name from the contract and write yours in.
For most millionaires (and all investors) who have stocks, the broker will loan you money for your stock. It's called a margin loan, some places give as little as 1% interest (see Interactive Brokers). If you have enough stocks to live on borrowed money, you don't have to sell (except to pay interest). Just remember, you only have to pay interest. The broker doesn't really care if you never pay the principal back - they hold your stock and if they have a problem, they can sell it. Aside from the interest, if you have enough stock, you can buy a house more cheaply than a mortgage. This is just another way to save more than the poor. The really rich have private banks that do the same thing, but they do it with their own personal service, and they usually do it much cheaper.
The unemployment is because the labor isn’t there, not because they’re refusing to work, but because they’re refusing to work for less than the minimum wage. Many employers don’t offer enough to afford a studio apartment, let alone food and transportation. The result is that a large number of people are finding other ways to get by. The pandemic has allowed people to think. People who were forced to stay home were able to realize how unfair the world was and how much they hated their jobs. And then there were the 600,000 people who died of the virus over the last two years. That’s a lot of positions to fill.
I'm not sure if there's any way to answer this question without making it political to some extent. At the core, companies didn't see the efficiency gains as an opportunity to shorten working hours. They saw them as an opportunity to make more stuff for less money and thus make more profits.
the real answer has to do with inheritance and step-up basis. If you inherit, for example, stocks, you get them at their current basis value and do not pay the capital gains tax that otherwise would have been due. If you, as an early investor or as an early founder, acquire shares for $1 and they rise to $1 million, you would otherwise have to pay $999,000 capital gains tax on their sale. But if you do not sell them and borrow $500,000 against them to finance your daily life, then die, then your heirs will sell them for $1 million and pay back the $ 500 000 without paying taxes on the profit. There are other more complicated structures, but these loans have to be paid back.
A slowdown in consumption throughout the economy... is usually caused by a certain economic event, which makes people spend less, and then it snowballs. For example, a stock market collapse can make people feel less rich when their portfolios go down, companies lay off workers when the value of their stocks goes down, or if real estate collapses, banks will stop lending, etc. Usually the original cause is more related to the financial sector or the investment class, and the effect is transmitted to the company and the general public, which leads to layoffs, more layoffs, etc.
That’s how they make billions of dollars. By releasing new movies, they not only keep their subscribers, but also draw in more.
It is recruiting people who pay to enter an organization, then those who have been recruited go out and recruit others who pay, and so on. Pyramids are disguised as a kind of job in sales. You pay a certain sum as a registration fee and then you sell something. You are probably paid a percentage of the turnover. If you recommend a friend, and he is “hired” and pays the training fee, you get a bonus.
One: How do you know that most people live on minimum income? The U.S. median income is $36,000 a year, or more than twice the minimum wage. Two: Amazon doesn’t just make money from private individuals. They sell a lot of products and services to other companies.
It's not fair. Same as giving smoking breaks, while the ones who didn't smoke were scolded for five minutes of fresh air.
When you’re shopping, all you really see is the first digit. That’s why buying two 10-inch pizzas seems like more than one 15-inch.
Without the slightest knowledge of monetary policy and macroeconomics, it is quite impossible to discuss the reverse repo. The reverse repo is basically a central bank loan to the big financial institutions, so that they can invest in the short term. They essentially loan money to the central bank, which reduces the money supply.
In many places you can buy land and own it on the surface, but not what's under it. It's like the air. You don't own the air over your property or they couldn't fly airplanes over it without compensating you.
Wealthy economies are generally service-based (that's one of their defining characteristics). Think of a typical "rich" society—I'm only talking about the most basic things, but one can go further—it's a matter of thinking about the question in detail. Take food, for example. How many times have you eaten food that gives you dysentery? Or food that gives you something that will kill you in a week? Where does the supply chain come from? How about food shortages? Where does the modern hospital come from? In a wealthy society people die from very few treatable diseases, and many diseases have become merely an inconvenience rather than a death sentence. When we break our arm or leg, we don't think we'll be amputated or die of sepsis—that wasn't true just a few hundred years ago. (iii) Education. Where does the support structure for specialization and the basic education we need for it come from? Literacy, etc.—all fairly new things. Look at a country like India—that doesn't happen automatically. Scientific research, technological progress, can only take place in a society that has the resources to promote education from the bottom up. (iv) Workplace safety. How many people die in factories and workplaces? How many have their health and life expectancy been destroyed by their working conditions? How do these regulations get enforced? (v) The economy. How do we create these improvements? By law, by inspection, by certification, etc. Entertainment, transportation, communication, finance, etc., etc. The modern economy is complex, and the average person in it enjoys a standard of living that was not even available to kings two hundred years ago. If 80% of people were farmers or working in the primary sector, there's no way that a society would have enough left over to provide these services for the average person.
Revenue minus costs makes profit, but not value. What if a company is able to hold on to its profits year after year? What if it uses those profits to increase production? What if it just spends them all?
It’s a relic of the early days of credit cards. Before direct debit and the Internet, shops that accepted credit cards would run them through a machine that imprinted the numbers on the plastic card onto a paper form. The shop then had to fax the paper form to the bank to be checked off by a clerk. Your signature served as a way of proving you had paid for the goods with your own money. The shopkeeper would also receive a monthly letter from the bank with a list of all the inactive cards in the area. If he checked the letter and found that a customer’s card wasn’t on it, he would be liable for the bill. My grandfather was a victim of this a number of times in his garage. If your card was turned down, they literally chopped it up as they do in the movies. It was a lot easier when the bank that handled the transactions was right down the street. Today it’s just a useless formality. Now people usually have credit cards with an embedded chip and a PIN. The transactions are verified digitally in real time, and fraud-prevention systems monitor your purchases for anything unusual, like a sudden purchase in another country.
If you are borrowing from a bank or credit union, you should always make sure that they are borrowing at a rate below the rate of inflation. The bank that lends to you may be borrowing at a rate that is below the rate of inflation.
They are now only in the secondary deal, but their main business model is to sell advertisements. Real estate agents, loan officers, insurance companies, etc., pay Zillow to ask for a connection.
UBI would not be in addition to, say, the social insurances and pensions; it would entirely replace them, at a cost for the State perhaps similar or even lower, and thus would not prove very burdensome for many people now getting benefits. This is how it would be financed, and consequently the effects on inflation would not be as great as one might suppose.
it means that the US Treasury’s account (that is, the account of the federal government) shows a balance of zero. The solution is to raise the debt ceiling, so that they can keep borrowing money in the short term, and in the long term to adjust the spending and taxation so that the income and the spending line up, so that it won’t be a problem. We even had a surplus under the Clinton administration, so that not only didn’t we have to borrow, but we even had extra money to spend.
Steam charges you $49 for the game and then pays the publisher $36 for the game license. They keep the difference. That's why big publishers like Ubisoft, EA and Microsoft had a great interest in building their own storefronts some years ago. They want to keep the difference.
* Because they don’t make any profits. But they’re making billions! * Yes and no. Profit is what’s left over from the money spent on production, rent, wages, interest, etc. That’s what they’d pay tax on. But companies like Amazon and the others generally ‘reinvest’ all their profits, so in the end they have a big turnover but next to no profit in their accounts. Imagine that you have a lemonade stall and instead of paying yourself a salary, you buy a larger stall, a parasol, some chairs for your customers, employ a friend as managing director and pay yourself a salary, hire a researcher to come up with a better lemonade, take on a promoter to sell your lemonade, and then go on to buy other lemonade stalls. All of this on credit (i.e., in advance of having the money) – so your lemonade empire will show no profit. * That’s basically one thing; the other thing is that these companies move their ‘head office’ to countries with low tax rates, set up various subsidiary companies, and shift money between them (by, for example, lending it to themselves and selling things to themselves).
Because they're lying. Or because they pay you in a credit that you can then use to bet real money, not cash you can take out. So now you have $100 or $150 and start betting real money, regardless of whether you win or lose. The house knows that there are enough people who like the thrill of gambling so much that if they could just get a taste of it, they would turn into long-term customers. It's like a drug dealer giving out samples. Once you get addicted, you're going to keep coming back and end up spending a lot of money.
Brand awareness. You see 400 Kia commercials in a month and two Ford commercials, which will you buy at the dealer’s? Which of them is more memorable?
There are several reasons. At the end of the year, everything has to be wrapped up as soon as possible. Invoices have to be sent, everything checked, errors fixed, etc. ; and doing that in a hectic time when there are many things to do besides the end-of-year accounts, and doing it while people are on vacation is difficult and annoying. An example would be taking an audited, complete stock-taking of all products on New Year’s Eve or New Year’s Day in order to get the accounting right. In some countries, the tax year doesn’t match the calendar year, which gives even less incentive to follow the calendar year. As a company, it’s better to end the year when you’re not busy; it gives a better picture of the difference in the years, since purchases made a week earlier or later still fall into the same year, and returns, and so on; the less stock on hand at year’s end, the better. There’s also an incentive not to have year-end all at the same time. If you use external accountants, they like to spread their work out over the year as much as possible. Finally, there’s no particular reason to follow the calendar year unless the law says so. It doesn’t really cause any confusion. Companies may choose to start their year with the day they start or change their structure, so they can get a yearly comparison from year two.
a few private companies that monitor your financial situation with the help of your taxes, debts, and financial institutions, monitor your credit cards, mortgages, and other indicators of your “creditworthiness.” They are all weighed in order to arrive at a single, average figure. This function is important because credit and other companies want to make sure that you can pay back their money before they offer you their services. A low credit score will lead to a certain company not offering their most expensive products and services, or doing so at higher prices, because the risk that you won't pay your debts is assumed. Financing big items such as cars and houses becomes significantly more expensive for people with low credit scores because of the higher interest rates. It is argued that this protects the economy because it ensures that credit is offered to those who can afford it. It is argued that it keeps the poor poor.
Many shareholders aren’t in it to make the corporation succeed. They’re looking for a return on their investment within a reasonably short time frame. And so corporations are under pressure to make decisions that give them short-term profits.
It’s impossible, because a country’s wealth is not the same as the wealth of its citizens. The government cannot confiscate anyone’s wealth without legal sanction. So nothing would happen. You’d just have someone who has more money than anyone else.
The US government prints its own money, so it cannot run out of it. When governments which control their own currency fail to earn enough taxes or bonds to pay their expenses, they have to print money to pay their bills. As there is more money but not more wealth, this devalues all the money already in circulation. As this continues, there is hyperinflation: the currency is rapidly losing value and becomes almost worthless.
Because they haven’t passed a law to do away with it. That’s all. Every single thing that the government does needs to be authorized by law. The “debt ceiling” is really just a law that authorizes the Treasury to borrow up to a certain amount in order to operate the government, and they’re bound by law not to go over that amount. So we have to authorize them to borrow more every time they get close to the limit. A law to abolish the debt ceiling has been discussed — basically, all authorizations to spend money also authorize borrowing money to pay for the spending — but neither party has shown any interest in passing it.
It is because of the smear tactics by our political parties demonizing all social programs. There is a long history of this attitude in the United States. It is not so much that the population would never want it, but that they have been told that it will not work for them.
Even if the goods are sold at a discount, they usually sell for more than they paid for it, so it shows you what kind of mark-up they have when they sell it to you. Sometimes they are just getting rid of the things and perhaps they only break even or lose a little to make space for new things.
There is no reason to assume that it is, in fact, stronger. The "strength" of a currency has nothing to do with the unit it uses. Is a distance of 20 kilometres or 14 kilometres the longest? The distance of 14 kilometres is longer, even though 20 is a greater number than 14. As for the currency units, they are basically meaningless and deviate from the point, we should talk about the average income in the countries and purchasing power parity instead. Basically, when people say that a currency is strong, they mean that there is a high and reliable demand for the currency. The usd will be able to buy a commodity in the future, and the us government is not going to fall and not cause hyperinflation. There is a demand for the usd because it is used to buy a commodity in the future. A weaker currency has a questionable stability, and is also used as a medium of exchange, but there is little commodity that it can be used for.
I read somewhere that it had about 700 million subscribers and earned about $ 7 billion a year. Basically, it was used to buy the rights to the film and the series of other producers. But since the producers of these films and series, such as NBC and Disney, started their own streaming services, Netflix had to start producing its own original series to retain subscribers. They basically started spending some of the money they earned from subscribers to produce their own films and series.
Usually because the public services are largely paid for by the local property taxes, and the rich tend to be the decision makers. You can write a thousand-page book on this, but generally speaking, the rich get to decide who gets what.
YouTube has an agreement with every music publisher that lets you put up otherwise infringing content as long as you turn over all monetization rights to the rightful publisher. When you put up a music video, YouTube will just take care of this automatically without you having to do anything. But it's also possible to get a license to post your cover videos on YouTube and keep the revenue. There is something called a mechanical license, which has allowed you to play cover songs on stage for a long time. But this doesn't apply to YouTube and you need to make a direct deal with the music publishers. This is not something that can be done by everyone. But if you have enough subscribers and views, the music publishers will also license your content. A mechanical license will allow you to release an audio-only version of your cover song. Small bands on YouTube don't release such an album because a mechanical license costs money, which you don't get back by releasing the song for free.
That's exactly what stops you. To sell a stock at a peak or buy a stock at a dip, you'd have to know that tomorrow the stock price is going to go up or down. But if you knew the price of stocks tomorrow, then, yes, by all means go to the stock market and become a billionaire.
They go to the seller, unless you buy from a broker, who may charge you a fee. And they never sell out, because there are endless quantities of stocks out there. If you had enough money to be a noticeable buyer, you would not do it personally, you would have a fund manager or a broker to deal with that.
the answer varies, depending on the school of thought the respondent comes from. But the basic answer is always the increase in the supply of goods and services.
it's a psychological ruse to trick people into paying less attention to the price. It has also become a tradition.
Human Resources. This is the department in a company that is responsible for the staff, incoming and outgoing personnel, and making sure the company is protected from any risk.
There is a cost to all money. It’s the lowest cost with cash. As a merchant you don’t have to pay any percentage to the bank or the card company. You don’t have to deal with annoying customers who buy something and then don’t like it and then start a chargeback, which costs even more. From the customer’s point of view, not everyone has easy access to credit because it is considered too risky.
Because without a gold standard, a different medium has to be set up as a standard for trade between countries. As the US has been the superpower for the past sixty to seventy years, most countries have chosen to use our currency as a standard. And when the US falls out of superpower status as all nations with that degree of power eventually fall out of superpower status—give it a few decades or centuries—then the standard will change.
They buy the coin for cheap well before they tell anyone. And then they sell to the very people they’re hyping to. By the time the scheduled pump comes, they’ve already sold their assets to the suckers who thought they were going to game the market.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias An old refrigerator that survived until today will likely keep going, but you are ignoring all the old ones that died after a few years. But also, the machines and electronics today are much more complicated. They are more expensive and break down more often, but they are also much safer and more energy efficient, which means you'll spend less money over the long run.
Per capita GDP includes all sorts of things that don’t really affect the people who live in a country. Ireland, for example, has a lot of its per capita GDP in companies whose production goes to Ireland but the jobs go to Switzerland or Germany.
The mass media (owned by the same people who own the politicians) would rather it seem like one man's fault, and that it's something you can prevent by voting for a different man. But they would rather expose the long-term policies and global circumstances, which would highlight how the whole system is corrupt and not working for the people. If they talked about the billions of dollars we spend subsidizing the oil companies, but that we never notice any difference at the pump, they would lose people's confidence and make them merely anti-government, instead of merely anti-Republican.
Men create objects of value by converting what already exists into more useful forms. Consider a tool, a hammer. It has a certain objective value and utility. But it started out as metal in the ground and a tree. Some people dug up that metal and turned it into the head of a hammer. Others felled a tree and turned it into the handle. Others assembled the hammer. So where you once had just earth and trees, now you have a hammer. That’s the way all wealth is created. We take something that’s not useful and make it useful. Computer code, for instance, is just a bunch of random memory in a machine somewhere, but if we arrange the memory in a certain way, we have a valuable program. A house, too, started out as lumber, copper, concrete, sand, etc. If I were to give you a pile of all the stuff that went into your house, you wouldn’t value it. You’d certainly find it less valuable than having the house itself.
Americans have less free time than most Europeans. The US is richer than almost all of Europe, except Norway and a few microstates. We usually put Western Europe together with the US, but there’s a gap. The US has 20 % more GNP per capita than Germany, for example. Germany is bound to 34 days of leave per year, America to none. The average US salary covers 1,750 working hours, the average German salary covers only 1,350. Multiplying these two figures, the same worker in the US and Germany can expect to earn 50% more per year than his German counterpart. However, the main thing is that there are fewer regulations on employment in the US than in most European countries. This makes it easier to fire someone, but also means that top performers can earn more in line with the value they add. This leads to a greater disparity between the rich and the poor, because the top end of the American pay scale is much higher.
In a general sense, currencies, like everything else, are ruled by supply and demand. If a country, A, exports a lot to country B, A's currency is strongly demanded (because usually you don't accept foreign currency for your goods, but want your own currency, so you can pay employees, taxes, etc.), so its exchange rate against B goes up. But if A imports a lot from B, then B is in a stronger position and the exchange rate of A against B will fall (because B's exchange rate against A goes up). Also, if a country is growing, foreign investors try to invest more of their money in its bonds, which means that the demand for its currency increases, which increases its exchange rate. For the sake of completeness, part of it is also just some statements by central banks and high politicians. If they make a statement that leads to a belief that a country will grow and they are believed, people will try to invest in this country. But if, on the contrary, a country is expected to decline (or high-ranking officials who have made such statements are not believed), then the foreign currency will not be favored.
This is health insurance for pets. You pay a monthly premium and, should your pet need expensive care (beyond the normal veterinary visit), the insurance will pay for it.
Usually, it happens when there is little confidence in the government. Germany in 1923 is an example of this. If I don't think that a country will be around in a few years, I will demand more currency from you in exchange for any object, so that I can limit the risk. This is exactly the way that bad borrowers demand more security than good borrowers. It's a way to manage risk.
Other companies became more progressive, while these ones remained stagnant. AOL was a network within a network; you actually had to leave their network to use other content. Today almost everything is on the “main” Internet.
If your employee brings in two hundred dollars a day to your company, normally you pay him one hundred. That’s how you get richer as an employer. The basic thing is to squeeze as much as you can from the working class and then invest part of the money you get in order to make more money. Rich people can afford to do this.
The short answer is: Whose money will you burn? The shorter answer is: We can. The longer answer is: They didn't actually print any more money; the number of physical dollars in circulation isn't drastically greater than it was two years ago. So how does the economy get more money? It's actually very simple, when was the last time you paid for something with cash? In the United States, the answer is that the Fed's Open Market Committee decides on how much interest to charge banks for overnight loans. The rate is the same as what banks charge each other when they lend money to each other, which is called the Fed Funds rate. The higher the Fed Funds rate, the more expensive it is for banks to lend and operate, and these costs are passed on to the whole economy. So when the Fed wants to make money less liquid, to limit its value and the money supply, it raises the Fed Funds rate, which will make it more expensive for borrowers to borrow money. This is the problem, because this is a very slow and retrograde policy, and yesterday's loan interest rates are usually still valid today. This actually happened in the eighties, after years of high inflation between the 'Nixon shock' in March 1971, when the US government completely stopped redeeming gold, and when Volcker's policies began to have an effect. By June 1981, the Fed Funds rate was 20 percent. That caused a large-scale economic crisis and national unemployment rose to more than 10 percent. So if the current high-price situation continues, we can also expect the Fed to make the same reaction. The credit industry will advocate for the government to change policies to protect the industry. The Federal Reserve is the house.
Moratorium means “temporarily suspended enforcement.” It doesn’t mean you don’t owe the rent, and the landlord can still sue you for it, and eventually the court will confiscate your salary or you’ll go bankrupt. The same reason you can’t just borrow money and not pay it back. Where I live, the people we evict are generally treated very harshly, especially when they have children. So our equivalent of your moratorium is simply our normal situation. But we do have social welfare payments for rent.
if I produce bottled water, I buy bottles and fill them with water. Why do I not buy plastic and make my own bottles? Why does this not save you the cost of paying another company, plus taxes for buying and selling, plus maybe transport? You can do that if you have enough capital. It's called vertical integration. But as I said, it takes a huge investment to own and control ten of the different links in the production chain, instead of only one, and therefore ten times as many resources, ten times as many business contacts, ten times as many special equipment, ten times as many special people. Now instead of one business you run ten. And then there is the concern about market power.
It depends on where you go, but generally Pepsi and Coca-Cola give a discount to restaurants that only serve their products. So, many restaurants choose to serve just one.
Are you asking what's wrong with money laundering? It's illegal because money is being laundered either to avoid paying taxes or to cleanse the money earned by illegal means.
The board of directors represents the interests of the company’s shareholders. In theory, they are the highest authority in the company—CEOs, CFOs, etc., answer to the board and are appointed by it. Generally speaking, the board of directors is responsible for making the big decisions in the company. Directors are generally paid a salary for their time. They are appointed by the shareholders at an annual meeting. Since many board members of large companies are quite wealthy and powerful, it takes some effort to recruit them, often because the company gets a certain amount of prestige from having them on the board. Some directors are directly appointed by major shareholders, although technically they are “voted in” by the shareholders, depending on the company’s by-laws.
One's assets minus one's liabilities or obligations. A person who has $1 billion in assets but $500 million in liabilities has a net worth of $500 million.
As a former project manager (not in civil engineering), I can tell you that unlike other industries, like say, software, or even other construction projects where more of the whole project is _entirely_ under your control (like building an airport or erecting a new chemical refinery), public projects have so many pieces going on. And many of them aren't under your control. If you're a project manager at BP building a new refinery, you have your EIA already done, you've already lined up your contractors, you own the land, and you don't give a hoot about your interruption of the other facilities you operate—because you have taken measures to ensure they won't be interrupted. And if your contractors have to drive around the block to get to the job, well, then, you pay them overtime. The only one affected is you, or your corporation. But with a public project, you've got to do public consultations, you have to move utilities, relocate roads, you have to work out how to bring in the materials, and thousands of other things _before you even dig a hole in the ground_. And all these steps to restore the old conditions are planned for after the bridge is up and running. If the building of the bridge goes wrong, everything goes haywire. Didn't they say they'd reroute Bus 207 and put it back on the bridge the following week? It needs six buses a day, and that means six extra drivers, and six buses. They'll be needed to restore the southbound route to Ocean Boulevard after the new sewer goes in. If the building of the bridge goes longer, I need six more drivers and buses. Well, you can't really do that; the city planners do that, and they don't like you. Anyway, you can mitigate many of these problems by having contingency plans. But that requires resources to be reserved and allotted, and that costs money. I can design a project for you to be done on time, but if you want it to absorb all contingencies, you'll probably like it. A good example is in my hometown where they were building an underpass for the railroad. Every day the railroad was down cost the city $XXXXX. They had to pour the concrete in February—in Canada. The weather forecast said it would be good that week, but if the temperature is below X degrees, the concrete sets too slowly, or cracks, or whatever—I'm not a civil engineer. To keep the pouring going, they erected a huge heated tent, big enough to house all the machinery and the shotcrete trucks. They reckoned it cost them $XXXX. Good God, did the idiots squeal about that. And they were upset enough about the pouring not going as planned (and you have to redo it if it doesn't turn out right). Anyway, if they had lost a day of work, it would have cost the city $100,000 or more a day. So, $XXXXX to protect against what could easily be many times that, sounds like a bargain to me. So, yes, a public project is a balance between cost and what the city can afford, with minimal impact on other government departments, and minimal interruption to people and business and traffic. There are so many pieces to the puzzle that if one of them goes wrong—like the archeological survey missed a native burial ground—the whole thing falls apart or you have to activate expensive contingency plans.
Importing – getting something from a foreign country and bringing it into your own. Exporting – sending something from your country to a foreign country.
Inflation is calculated by the so-called consumer price index (PPI). This is a certain average of the prices of various items that people usually buy. The CPI value is calculated over time, which then shows the relative change in prices and thus inflation. It is therefore possible to calculate the real increase in wages based on the CPI. However, it is impossible to calculate the perfect calculation for the annual increase in wages, because the inflation rate varies from year to year, so this year there was a 6.8 percent price increase, while other years only show an increase of two percent.
Not a picture, but a trend. People are fond of the idea of high-yielding investments, to the point of not even thinking about them at first.
The reverse repo market is one of the many instruments used by the Fed to control inflation. And since it has reached this level, it is clear that the Fed is worried about the possibility of inflation in the near future.
Unfortunately, customs in Mexico is very corrupt. I've had to put people on airplanes and fly them down there in order to get any sort of electrical device delivered to its intended destination. I've had employees who've ordered laptops and received either a different model or a box full of rocks. Companies don't want to deal with that on a continual basis.
By the size of the package. So where you might have gotten, say, a 10-ounce box of cereal for a buck in the year 2000, now it’s a 6-ounce box for a buck. Or 9 sponges per package, now you get four.
Well, for one thing, that’s mostly not true. Prices shot up under Bush, then fell during the financial crisis. Then they shot up again after the Arab Spring, then fell thanks to fracking in 2014. Again they shot up recently, for various reasons (OPEC refusing to increase production, general inflation from the economic recovery, excessive government spending worldwide, etc.). As you can see, none of these causes have anything to do with which party controls Congress or the presidency. Prices shot up under Bush (mainly) because of the collapse of Iraq’s production and because of sanctions on Iran preventing their exports. During the financial crisis, as mentioned above, prices fell for a while. The Arab Spring shot them up again, then fracking caused them to drop (both under a Democrat). To sum up, neither the president, nor his party, has much of an effect on gas prices. This can all be seen in an excellent chart from the Fed.
To put it briefly, they are not filing for bankruptcy. They have created a separate company and transferred all the responsibilities for future lawsuits about them putting asbestos in their talc to this company. Then that company has filed for bankruptcy. This is a business move to limit the amount of money they have to pay out for lawsuits, and has nothing to do with the fact that the mother company is running out of money. It’s an extremely clever legal maneuver. Morally, it is exactly what one would expect from a company that has for many years been knowingly selling a product which contains cancer-causing material.
Taxes are higher in Europe than in the United States, and that difference is used to fund social services such as health care or government-supported universities.
The Dow Jones is the index of the thirty largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange. The S&amp;P 500 is an index of the 500 largest companies on the Stock Exchange. NASDAQ is a separate stock exchange, where most of the new technology companies are traded. The 35,000 figure is the total value of the Dow Jones, 93 is the change from yesterday's close, and.25 is the percentage change from yesterday.
They are the same thing. [An act of parliament (also called a statute) is a law that has been made by the UK parliament. Statute law is different from other types of law, such as case law, which has been established by the courts.]
It is because these profits are used to accumulate wealth for the ultra-rich owners of the companies, and the companies' employees remain stuck on minimum wages.
The fact of the matter is, the more money you have, the easier it is to make money. Many of the great wealthy (millionaires are the lowest on this list) own the means of production. They own the companies we work for. They don't have to put in the forty-hour week. From a certain point on, money becomes a number, it is immediately returned, they have no lack. There are billionaires who earn money faster than they can actually spend it. They often buy for social reasons, in their own little circle. This great disparity in wealth is a great problem for the world. Crises such as the flu pandemic or the great crisis of 2008 do not hurt them, but make them richer. A crisis, when you have this kind of money, is just a discount sale. In Las Vegas, entire neighborhoods were bought up at bargain prices when the housing bubble burst. People were losing their homes and the rich bought them up to rent them. It's going on every day, and at the end of the day, the world ends up being very expensive and we don't have anything. So we sell the only thing we have, our time.
The general idea is that rich people and corporations, if they have more money, will create more jobs and potentially more lucrative jobs. The more money people have, the more they can spend, thereby stimulating the economy. In practice, it was a colossal failure. Wealthy people kept their money to themselves. Companies invested in themselves and workers’ wages stayed the same.
The stock represents the company’s share. The assets of a company, minus the liabilities, equals the value of the stock. In the case of a simple company with $1,000,000 in cash, no liabilities, and 1,000 shares of stock outstanding, there are now 1,000 shares of stock in the company, and a hundred thousand dollars more will be made available for sale. The stock is now worth $1,000,000 (1,000 shares x $100,000). Let’s assume the company releases 1,000 more shares, and they sell for $1,000,000 each. Now the company has $2,000,000 in cash, and 2,000 shares of stock. Each share is still worth $100,000 (two million divided by 2,000 shares). Each share of stock now represents a smaller percentage of the total assets, but since the total assets have increased, each share of stock is still worth $100,000.
Interests being low, the companies borrow cheap and put it to use in their business and, thereby, create employment. If the interest rate were high, the companies could not invest so much and there would be less employment.
Because the farm is charging you a lot more when you buy directly from them than they are charging the store. A big part of this is the value added —most people are willing to pay more for farm-fresh food, so the farmer charges what people are willing to pay. The other part is the farm’s overhead: it takes about the same effort to grow an ear of corn whether it is for you or for a store. But for the store they just dump the corn from their harvester truck into a big truck going to the store, and the added cost of shipping it there is very small. For you they have to set up and maintain and staff some kind of store where they sell the corn, do the handling in small quantities, deal with payments, etc., etc. The stores have huge logistics operations that do this with extreme efficiency and large scale, which the farmers cannot hope to compete with, so they sell to the stores for less than they sell to you. And then of course the small local farms are not selling to big grocery stores at all, so it’s not even the same market.
Bankruptcy does not mean that a person or an organization has no money and assets. It means that they can't pay back their debts in full and on time. By filing for bankruptcy, the court will intervene and try to arrange the debts to be paid back as quickly as possible without completely crushing the person or the organization. So, Hertz still has money and is still able to operate despite the bankruptcy. Also, buying cars does not necessarily mean that the company has to pay for it in full. Most of the time, they borrow money to buy cars, and then they pay the loan back in installments. If a company can't pay the debts on time, they might still be able to pay other debts in the future.
a good question. If the market represents company profits, how can company profits grow at 10% per year, while the economy only grows at 2-3% per year? First, the 2-3 is after inflation, and the 10 is before inflation, so the 3 economy grows at 7 or 8 percent. Third, profits can be earned in other ways than through profit growth. Dividends and buybacks are ways for shareholders to earn great returns without increasing profits. Fourth, the market can also go up for no reason. If last year the company earned a profit of $ 10 billion, and this year it also earned a profit of $ 10 billion, but I think this year is better, or I have less confidence in other investment choices, such as bonds. The market shows this by the P/E ratio going up.
In general, tax havens are about managing tax liabilities, not evading them. This is mainly a problem when doing international business. (eg if you live in the US and trade in the US, you generally pay taxes in the US) But this question becomes more complicated when it comes to doing business in other countries. By establishing trusts and establishing branches in other countries, if profits are generated, then if profits are earned, then the profits are taxed at the rate of that country (that is, still a legal thing). The purpose is to manage how much taxes are paid and when they are paid. Not to pay what is due is what is illegal. Tax management is a matter of timing and using other countries' tax systems - that is, you will pay all the necessary taxes (that is, you will not avoid them). But the problem is that you will generally pay less than if all the business was done locally.
You don’t have to worry about robots replacing workers. There are many things you do that are far more complicated than you think. Try preparing your next meal like a robot. Each time you move your arm or finger, someone has to program that movement. Since robots don’t have feelings, they need to be told exactly how much pressure to apply or they’ll crush whatever they touch. If you have to see something, the robot also needs to see it. You can recognize ingredients but a robot can’t. Someone has to program it to recognize the ingredients. If you have to smell something burning, the robot has to be programmed to sense it. How do you know when to stop what you’re doing and save the meal? A robot can’t. In factories, robots are wonderful because they can do the same task over and over again. A robot that chops onions can chop a thousand times more onions than a human can, but a restaurant only needs a few onions. So there’s no point in buying a robot to cut onions. But you do have to worry about artificial intelligence. It may not replace the person who cuts the onions, but it will replace the person who orders the onions and the person who calculates how many onions you’ll need the next week and the person who makes sure you can pay for them. These are all “good” jobs that won’t exist in twenty years. I predict we’ll have a period of poverty and turmoil like the Great Depression. Eventually the government will adopt universal basic income, and the world will move toward a post-scarcity society.
The float is just the money you have in your cash register at the beginning of the day, and it's mostly small change and coins so you can make change for people who pay with large bills throughout the day. Because if people often pay for their lunch with a ten- or twenty-dollar bill, you need a lot of one-dollar bills and coins to make change, and your cash register also fills up with bigger bills. If you have too little float, you can run out of change for a customer, which is a bother, because you may have to ask your manager to unlock the cash register and bring out some change. When the boss counts the cash at the end of the day, the boss usually makes sure that the sum of all the bills you've taken in plus the float are equal to the total amount of money you've earned. If there's a difference, it means the cashier has made a mistake somewhere.
The difference between capital gains tax and regular income tax is huge. If you're a rich person, the capital gains tax is much lower than the upper tax brackets in which you would fall by selling income. So you just buy something, wait a year, and then sell it, you already pay less tax. You can be more imaginative if you have a diversified portfolio. You probably have a lot of 'good' and 'bad' income. If you sell some bad income, you pay less tax and therefore you have more control over how much you pay. But what if you have a business? Depending on your business, you can deduct many things for business expenses, as long as you have some kind of justification that they serve a business purpose.
The cost of physically producing the book is a small percentage of the price, and the difference is usually minimal. Most of the costs are the same—payment to the author and all those involved in the publishing process.
A: (a) After the IPO, it seems that the underlying shares could not be sold in full, and the underwriter bought it at $20 (below the market price). This will make the market value go down.
Nominal value is only a number, not an economic value. You could revalue the Euro so that one new Euro equals ten old ones, and everything would stay the same, except that its value would change in relation to the U.S. dollar. What matters is the value of the currency over time. The problem is that the Euro is too young, from the historical point of view. It's barely 20 years old, and for some countries even less.
Because they don't want to pay decent wages. There is no shortage of workers. Only a shortage of willingness to pay for skills.
The ssn is made up of three parts: area, sequence, and serial number. The area (first three digits) indicates where you were born or where you got your first SSN. If someone knows that, then the first three digits are not necessary. The sequence (next two digits) is based on your date of birth, if someone knows your date of birth, then the sequence is not necessary. The number is unique and it is almost impossible to guess from public sources alone. This is the most important part of the ssn to protect and the most revealing. So if I ask you "Where and when were you born, and what is your last 4 digits?" I know your whole ssn.
America is one of the top 5 countries that produce and sell agricultural products. I don't know what you mean by "not producing anything to the rest of the world."
It would be the same as if it ran out of credit. So the United States is fundamentally on credit, and the credit limit has to be raised from time to time (the debt ceiling). The debt is reduced by the issue of Treasury bonds. But if the credit runs out, the bonds will become worthless, and it will be a pretty bad thing. Then interest rates rise and stock prices fall. So the economy collapses, and the governments will have to reduce spending and reduce food subsidies, disability payments, social security, military benefits, and federal employee salaries.
For at least oil, the US has an agreement with certain Middle East countries that it will protect them if they sell their oil in dollars. This has created a great demand for dollars and made them artificially valuable to the advantage of Americans. Recently, two Arab leaders expressed their desire to sell oil in euros. Their names were Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein.
The taxes taken out from your pay are only an estimate of the amount you will owe at the end of the year. When your taxes are due, you or your tax agent will examine your income and your tax situation, and if you have overpaid the government, it will send you the difference between what you have already paid and what you still owe.
You think people are using bitcoin as a currency. In the end they don't. They use it as an investment. You don't spend it, you hold it until the price is at its peak and then you get it. Those who spend it are mostly people who want to buy something immediately, but it's not possible to do it with a regular currency (because it's uncertain, because they are not allowed to use them, because the payment service provider does not want to work with them, because their national currency is a mess or whatever) so they do not have a choice to keep crypto. They buy it, send it right away, and the other party is probably also converting it as soon as possible.
In addition to the tax deduction, it’s also a PR thing. For example, DoorDash gave a million dollars to Sesame Street this year. And then they spent $5.5 million on advertising about how they donated a million.
it depends on who the beneficiaries are. The insurance company sends separate checks to each beneficiary. Usually, no income tax is due on the payout. Source: I am an estate planning lawyer.
Because the US economy is so influential in world affairs. It is the world's largest economy. If the Americans stop buying, then the whole world's economy is affected. Also, the financial institutions that went under in 2008 had huge influence and investments all over the world. In addition, at least in the case of stock markets, a lot of the value of the market comes from belief and trust. When something happens to destroy the confidence that people have that investing in the stock market is a good thing to do, people start pulling their money out, which tanks the market.
The managers do not buy bonds with their own money. They buy them with the money of “us” the investors. It is these savings that the managers manage.
A pool of similar debt, which, having been collaterised, can be bought on the market. It is based on the cash-flows and rents of the companies concerned. It is rather like an ETF, but on the debt side.
First of all, we need to define “rich.” There are people who work for their money, like doctors, and small business owners who go to their shops and restaurants every day, still working for their bread and butter. Those are not the ones being referred to when people say: Tax the rich. They are not what you might call “working rich.” You can work hard and, with luck, make a million in two years. But to make a billion you have to steal the work of thousands and thousands of others, most of whom earn so little they struggle just to survive. Take this one step further, and just apply a little common sense. Who is better for the economy? If one person has a billion dollars, how many pair of Levis do you think he can buy? How many times does he eat out at a local restaurant? Now if you spread that billion over a hundred million people, how many times do restaurants get more customers, how many things do people buy in stores and on the Internet? One person keeping a billion dollars he has stolen is not a very good thing for the economy, but a hundred million people spending a few dollars extra every week is a boon for local business. Let’s not forget that in the past the real rich were taxed at rates as high as ninety percent. Also, the income tax scale only applies to income over a certain amount, so you don’t even touch the so-called “working rich.” And, finally, the true rich don’t pay taxes now. My wife and I, who are barely middle class, paid more taxes last year than did Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. So I’m not even arguing that the super-rich should be taxed more, but they are not even paying their fair share of the money they hoard. And before anyone says: Yes, but they don’t have access to their money, you don’t understand how stocks work. Stock prices are driven up by predatory practices, by paying people as little as possible, which raises the value of their shareholdings. Those shares can also be given as bonuses and part of the compensation of employees. There are plenty of ways to share the disgusting wealth of the super-rich with the people who actually run the businesses.
Who is going to regulate the printing of money? If it is a single currency, then why can't the government of Zimbabwe print billions and distribute them? Then the economy of the whole world will collapse.
This sort of question comes up nearly every day, so try a few different terms and you'll get lots of answers.
No, not much. There are about 330 million people in the U.S., and 95% of that is about 313 million people. Assuming Bezos is the richest person in America with about $200 billion, and dividing it evenly means that each person would get only $639. This is not even a month's rent for most people, and the Fed has already spent trillions on stimulus and support for the economy. This would probably lead to a slight rise in prices, but not much. On the other hand, if he sold all of his Amazon shares, that would of course cause a crash in Amazon and would probably cause a crash in the stock market, but that's a much more complex discussion and I don't go into it.
Production budget doesn't include advertising. The rule of thumb is that a film must earn about twice its production budget after advertising to be considered a profit.
I think there is far more than enough. The new agronomic methods have been a virtual miracle. The only thing wrong is the distribution... and if you send to very poor countries food and materials (which we do), their corrupt governments prevent that it goes to the people.
Unemployment figures only count those who are actively looking for work. If someone refuses to work for a given wage or is not looking for work, they don’t count in the unemployment figures.
But nowhere near the impact that some employers and those arguing against a living wage claim it has. Let’s take some numbers from Subway. Their footlong turkey sandwich costs usually $5.89. The total cost for the food is $1.65. The cost of labor and other expenses comes to $3.04. Now, it takes my local Subway artisan two minutes to make a footlong sandwich. (Don’t ask why I timed it.) If the lunch hour is crowded, then the artisan can make about 30 sandwiches per hour. For each sandwich he is paid 50 cents. So the artisan is making $1.50 per hour. And if we were Kris Kringle and gave the artisan a raise of $5 per hour, then it would add... a whole 17 cents to the price of the sandwich. There is absolutely nothing else in the equation that changes. Now, my $5.89 footlong costs $6.06. And for the artisan, that raise of $5 per hour is a big fuckton deal. I’m not saying the franchisees shouldn’t keep some of the $2.50, either. There are the costs of rent, utility bills, franchise fee, etc. And if they say they can’t pay better wages, then they’re just saying they don’t want to. EDIT: Well, I’m getting attacked by some armchair economists. They’re right. My example is a very poor simplification of the very complex economic sphere that is Subway. All the people in the whole chain of production, and all the costs of supplies, will be pushed upward by a raise of just five bucks. And of course, the artisan spends much of the day slicing tomatoes and baking bread. He doesn’t make sandwiches all day. That $2.50, the part that goes before the $1.20 profit and after the $1.65 cost of food, that’s where the tomato slicing comes from. So, with all the wages and all the costs pushed upward in the chain, and with the addition of some of the tomato slicing costs being passed on to the consumers, the price of your sub could rise by a whole dollar, or even two. Would our $6.89 or $7.89 footlong seriously alter the demand curve? I’m not sure what Subway’s price elasticity is, but I’m guessing it would be quite steep. There would be some consumers who were buying the $5.89 footlongs, but they wouldn’t buy the $6.89 or $7.89 footlongs. And lower demand will mean lower sales, and so on, and so forth. These are all all valid points, and my original example was a gross simplification of Subway’s economics. But now, to improve our model, we have to come up with another, much more difficult question: What would be the total economic benefit of giving all the workers in our Subway economy a raise of five bucks per hour? The tomato slicing artisan, the artisan, the person who delivers the turkey, the guy who feeds the turkeys, all these people get raises out of that $2 rise in the price of the footlong. And now, these people can (more easily) buy a footlong of turkey sandwiches each day, instead of that meager depresso sandwich they brought from home. My basic point is still the same, even though the economy of Subway is too complex to be included. Raising wages does have an effect on prices, but much less than the naysayers claim. If you believe the naysayers, a 50 cent raise in the minimum wage would change everything and kill our economy. Not true.
The costs for society, especially in countries with public health care, outweigh the tax benefits.
You lend me a thousand dollars for a year at a yearly rate of 5 percent interest (we’ll assume for simplicity that there’s no compounding) then in a year I owe you the original thousand plus 5 percent—that is, after a year I owe you 1,050. True. But interest is mainly a compensation for risk. There is a risk that in a year I will not be able to pay you back the whole thousand (or any of it). So if you lend me the thousand at no interest, you risk losing something important—and there is no reward. So you would only lend it to me if I were a close relative, or your best friend, or had dirt on you. But by charging me interest, you create an incentive to lend to me, which can offset the risk of me not paying you back. And that’s why in general the riskier the loan, the higher the rate of interest. Interest is also a compensation for the fact that during the year you lend me the thousand, you’ll have less access to that money. (That’s called the “time value of money.”) And finally, interest is a compensation for the thing you asked about—inflation. Inflation is an increase in the price level. A yearly rate of 5 percent inflation means that prices generally have risen by 5 percent during the year. So you lend me the thousand at 5 percent interest, and in a year I pay you back 1,050, but there’s also a yearly rate of 5 percent inflation, so now you have to pay 1,050 just to buy the same stuff that last year cost you only a thousand. In practice, you didn’t gain anything; it was as if you had loaned me the thousand at no interest. And that’s why the expected rate of inflation is usually incorporated into the interest rate. If you had known in advance that there would be a 5 percent rate of inflation during the year, you would have been justified in charging me 10 percent interest instead of 5 percent to offset the effect of the inflation.
A bubble is when the price of an asset goes through the roof because the price is based on unreasonable market growth. In the current situation, houses are becoming more expensive because of a number of things: lack of homes on the market, health risks, private companies buying up entire neighborhoods and supply issues. It is unclear whether we are in a bubble, but I personally think we are.
There’s a strange law in the United States that says if your house is destroyed, you can get FEMA money and insurance, but only if you rebuild in the same place. If you move somewhere else, you lose your money. That creates a vicious circle of rebuilding in places that are susceptible to disaster, whether it’s from natural causes or climate change.
One hides two types of income abroad. The first is unrecognized or black income. Such as drug money, shady crypto gains, etc. And the second is legal income on which one does not want future passive income or capital gains taxes.
Inflation occurs because it is an inherent feature of our monetary system. Banks are lending out more and more money to businesses. The Central Bank tries to control this lending and bring it down to about 2% a year. This is done because otherwise we risk deflation. Deflation is very bad for the economy because if prices are falling, then putting all your money under your mattress is a better investment than starting a business, which can fail. Moreover, consumers will put off purchases. Why buy a car today, if it will be cheaper tomorrow? Deflation can occur very quickly because the more money is put under the mattress, the fewer coins there are, and the higher the value of each coin, the lower the price of everything. In short, we want Inflation to occur so as to prevent people from speculating with money.
A few things. —They pay the dealer, not you. It all works out at the time of purchase. You can get the loan approved ahead of time, but it's not like you get $ 20,000 and go have fun. —They hold the title to your car until the loan is repaid, which means that if you sell your car, you have to pay off the loan first. —Depending on your credit, whether the car is new or used, you may find that a loan from the dealer is better than a loan from a bank (no bank will give you 0% interest on a new car). —The biggest thing to watch out for is prepayment penalties. If I pay off the car in full two months after buying it, is there an extra charge? Because I shouldn't have to pay all the interest. And the amount of other charges (how much late payment and other charges are there, etc.). Most reputable banks have no such penalties. But some car loans do.
The Federal Funds rate is the base interest rate charged to all depository institutions for loans made by the Federal Reserve Bank. Banks borrow in some way or other from the Fed, which money they may then lend to customers for buying a house, for instance. The bank has to pay the Fed interest on these loans. Another source of money for banks is the customer deposits they receive. Those depositors are also interested in earning interest. Thus the bank is charged money to lend it to a borrower. So in both cases, the bank’s borrowing costs rise, and its cost of borrowing rises, resulting in higher interest rates charged to borrowers. You pay more than the bank pays the Fed for borrowing money. The same thing goes for the interest rate the bank pays on the deposits, which are always lower than the interest it pays on the loans. This is called the net interest margin, which is the most important profit center for any bank. This profit goes to paying expenses such as salaries, pensions, rent, etc. So if the Fed raises rates, then the bank has a higher cost of funds, and that cost gets passed on to customers through higher interest rates. At very low Fed rates such as we’ve had recently, the margin I’m talking about is pretty hard to maintain. Banks can’t offer higher rates on loans when rates are low, but then they can’t offer very high rates on deposits either. But in order to attract deposits, they have to pay some interest.
Well, the Bill of Several Bills runs to many pages, and I am not quite sure what you are referring to, but “free equity” is a financial calculation. For instance, if you undertake a building project, e.g. a toll-road, when the road is half-built it is said to have a certain "revenue value" which is not realised because no traffic is using it yet. When the road is completed, this “value” will be the amount of revenue the road brings in each year. That is why this “value” increases in small stages while the road is being built, in order to avoid some rather odd bookkeeping whereby the day before the road is finished some large amount “magically” appears. If the road costs $100 to build, by the time it is half-built you may have spent £50, but maybe £40 of this “value”, so you have only £50 left to spend on the road, but £90 of “free equity” which you could use for other roads. In the end, if it costs $100 to build a road which will bring in £80, the road is an investment. It may be a good investment and the government is willing to invest £20, but it is not in the government's interest to invest the full $100 and then give someone a "free road worth £80". The calculation of “free equity” makes the government's investment (which generally does not include this “free equity”) appear more accurately on the books.
No, there’s no benefit to the company. Either the company donates on the customer’s behalf, which is rare and so doesn’t allow them to claim a tax deduction, or the company donates in its own name and so must claim the income tax. This means there’s no net benefit.
It makes money more expensive to borrow and more attractive to save. This decreases spending, and thereby reduces the demand side of the forces that cause inflation.
Suppose you wanted to buy a painting hanging in a gallery. Some guy comes up to you and says, “Look, I’ll sell you this piece of paper, which says on it that whoever holds this paper will own the third painting on the left in gallery room 303, and that’s the one you’re interested in.” You say, “Fine!” and give him the money and he gives you the paper. Then you have a paper that says you own a painting! Hurray! However, you’re not allowed to do anything with the painting, because it’s still hanging in the gallery. And you’re not sure that the guy who sold you the paper actually owned the painting, and then the gallery may have moved the painting around, and then your paper will point to the wrong painting, or maybe the gallery may have shut down. And all that piece of paper probably required burning up 80 acres of Amazon rain forest. But NFTs are just like that, only digital and hip. They could be useful, but for now they’re just being sold from one trader to another, hoping to get more money from it later.
Because tax agents and corporations lobby Congress against any law that would simplify it.
It is being paid. Owning someone else's debt does not mean that you can call it in at will. When you borrow money from someone, you commit yourself to repaying it. Hopefully, during the interval you can earn more than you owe and repay your debt with interest. This is what the U.S. is doing. One reason why the United States is so highly regarded is that it pays its debts, and people are sure it will. And as to who owns it, most of it is owned by Americans. The balance is owned by foreigners.
Cheques are handled by a 'Clearing House' after your bank has received them. Here they are checked as to whether the Cheque is a valid one, and whether there is enough money to cover it.
It's like a regular job. It's a self-employed form 1040 once you reach a certain amount.
Theoretically, yes. Either through inflation or simply by devaluation, that is, requiring that all dollar bills be exchanged for lower-value ones. Such a currency adjustment has been needed in countries that have gone through hyperinflation, such as Venezuela, which exchanged its useless regular Bolivar bills for Bolivar "Fuerte" bills that kept their original value, but weren't marked up in the thousands and millions. A true deflationary policy is very rare, because it usually has terrible consequences. Imagine if your "fixed-rate" mortgage went up every month, and every dollar you own kept growing in value, no matter how hard you tried to spend it. Nothing gets done, no one spends, and the people who are in debt lose everything.
In a store, you can call the bank and ask for a withdrawal of 100 crowns from your business account. And then you can tell the bank exactly what denominations you want, in coins—how many 2s, 2s, 50ps, 20s, 10s, 5s, 2s, 1s, 50ps, etc., that you would use for your change in the shop. And when you come, they’ll count out the rolls of coins and put them in a bag for you to carry away.
Regardless of the country, bank regulations require banks to have a certain amount of cash on hand at the end of the day (or at closing time, as it is in your country). The amount of cash varies according to the money their customers have deposited with them. So if you transfer $100 from your account, then your bank needs to hold a bit less cash at the end of the day. If someone deposits money into your account, then the bank needs to hold a bit more cash. This explains why, in the past, banks insisted on a long delay in transferring money, long after it was possible to do it in one or two seconds. By keeping this delay, a bank was always several days behind the accounts in the registers. Now, for example, if I transfer $100 to your account on Monday, but the transfer isn’t completed until 5 p.m. on Thursday, then each of our banks has about three days to make sure that they have enough cash on hand. If you’re transferring money to someone in the same bank, then there’s no magic involved, it’s just a matter of whether the bank wants to transfer it right away or not. (For example, if you bank with Bank A, and you send money to your friend who also banks with Bank A, then it’s a matter of bank policy as to how quickly the money will transfer.) For interbank transfers, an app like OSKO works because your bank sets aside a certain amount of money to be withdrawn at the end of the day to cover the transactions it’s a part of. Other instant-transfer apps, like Zelle, work the same way. The main reason this was possible is because money has gotten so cheap. It’s very likely that the bank wouldn’t have earned much interest on this money, so the bank would rather spend it on “subsidizing” a service that most customers consider a basic perk. Usually these apps have limits on the number of transfers they allow, to keep the costs manageable. Checks still take time to clear because they are handled by an ancient system that is run by the government of your country. The time it takes for a check to go through that system is often set by legislation or policy, and there’s not much that can be done about it, unless the government decides to speed up the clearance process. Banks prefer to use the check system when large amounts of money are being transferred, because the built-in delay gives the bank time to deal with large-scale transactions like the ones that are still done with checks. The banks also usually allow instant transfers of any amount, for a fee. This fee partly covers the cost of the additional cash the bank has to hold on to at the end of the day.
It's a combination of many factors. Here are a few of them: Interest rates are so low that banks are willing to lend a lot more money to people than in the past. The five-times salary is not unique. As a result, in competitive housing markets, the speed of the rise is increasing as people compete with each other. Higher prices also increase rents, and as banks (reasonably) demand the same percentage down payment from people who currently rent, those who are renting have no chance of securing a down payment, although they could afford the loan. Then the wrong housing affects: more luxurious houses make far more profit for the developer, and there is a whole army of people who, after having ridden the increasing prices, are now able to easily afford the deposit on the luxury house. Rising house prices are seen as a good investment, there has not been a house crash in recent history that has not been overcome in a few years. People who invest in houses (rental) drive up the price, make it even more profitable to invest, and drive up the price. Houses are one of the few investments where the bank lends you money to invest. A lot of people can borrow several hundred thousand to buy a rental house. If you wanted to borrow several hundred thousand to invest in the stock exchange, you would be laughed out of the bank. Many landlords do not earn much money on the rent, it's not exactly easy since it's a competitive market, but they earn money on the rising prices. People are also crowded in the cities, there is a demand for houses, but there is nowhere to build more. Most countries where the prices are high do not have a shortage of houses - just a shortage of houses where people would like to live. Maybe working from home can correct that. In the UK, however, it has led to a lot of prices rising in the countryside because many are fleeing from the cities.
We like to live in houses and eat every day. That costs money. And working is the quickest way to get money.
It is the income you continue to receive after the work that earned it has been completed. The best example is a royalty. You write a song and get a certain sum for the song and a certain percentage of the royalties on it. The Y% is residual income, because you earn it after you have sold the song. It also means the income that is left over after the payment of debts and personal expenses in personal finance. It is the residual income that is used to assess the creditworthiness of a borrower. If you are asked about your residual income, the lender wants to know your salary minus all known debt (student loans, car payments, etc.).
Technically, the bank (or company) that you have invested in uses your money as capital to run its business. So, in exchange, the bank pays you a small amount for the use of its capital. This is what was explained to me as a child, when I first put money in the bank. In a similar way, but at a higher rate, if you borrow money from the bank, you pay interest to the bank for the use of its money. It could be completely wrong, but that’s how it was explained to me, when I was only a bit older than five years old.
The debt ceiling is the ceiling on the debt owed by the federal government. It is like the credit limit on a credit card: they can only borrow up to that ceiling. It is raised by Congress passing a bill that raises the ceiling and the president signing it.
Inflation. Something is only valuable if it is rare. So if I had a first edition of Percy Jackson's Lightning Strikers signed by the author, it would be worth more than a blank sheet of paper, but not so much when you need a penny to pay for your lunch at school. There are only twelve of these books in the world! People are willing to pay a lot for one of the twelve books! So this book would be worth, say, a thousand dollars. But then you learn that the author of Percy Jackson, Mr. Riordan, has a box of 500 more of these books signed by him. So now there are 512 copies of this book instead of twelve. People are no longer so willing to pay a thousand dollars for one of my books. Perhaps only forty dollars. Now that there are more books, my book is worth less. It is the same with money. If you print a lot of money, it will be worth less. The money is not set in stone. There are many countries that have tried this, and it usually ends up being a problem. If you print a lot of money, a bottle of milk can go from $3 to $300,000. But the real question is, why don't we just fix it? And that's partly because we'd have to completely change the way we live in the world, and many people don't want to do that.
The European Stability Mechanism is not actually an EU institution, but an international one. @@@ It helps only countries that use the euro, not the non-euro countries of the European Union. @@: its role is to stop the contagion spreading through the whole eurozone, should one country suffer a financial crisis.
If you have a substantial savings and have been a high-income worker the whole time, it may be worth setting up a new business in the Caymans or wherever, but your savings would still be meager, since you are not as rich as the people we hear about. You would still have to invest regularly in your business, and there would still be a lot of cost in terms of time to keep it compliant with Cayman law.
A bit wider field than just repaying a loan (according to the original agreement). Using an example: A borrows $100 from B and promises to repay $120 in two years. At the end of the first year, A buys the loan back from B, maybe for less than $120. Of course, this is a repayment, but it is also an action that may not have been foreseen by the original agreement. A: As you know, loans are complicated deals. For example, a company can issue 10-year bonds for 10% and buy them back if they so desire. A: For example, if a bank lends them money at 5%, they can borrow at a lower rate and buy back all or part of the bonds on the market in order to lower their costs.
In the US there are three credit agencies (Equifax, TransUnion, Experian) that receive information from banks, credit card companies, loan companies, electricity companies, etc. and these three agencies take all this information and calculate a number between 300 and 850, which is used as an immediate indicator of how trustworthy a person is. For example, if you have a credit card that you use and pay off every month, and you own a house, and you have not been late for several years, then you probably have a high credit score. You can also get a loan because it is considered less risky to lend you.
The matter is far more complex than what your question suggests. To begin with, Africa is a vast continent. Extreme poverty, hunger, and armed conflicts in some parts of the continent is not surprising. As it is, such problems also exist in North America. At the same time, there are areas of prosperity, growth, and industry in Africa, too. But these areas are tens of thousands of miles apart. Besides, on the whole, Africa is poorer than other continents. And this is mainly because of the long history of colonialism by powerful empires. Decolonization of Africa did not really begin in earnest until the 1960s. Even then, colonialism was replaced by superpowers using African countries as battlegrounds in their proxy wars. During this time, the outside powers kept trying to divide and rule the African countries. This is how they prevented the people from rising up against their oppressors. In addition to the economic and humanitarian exploitation, the countries are torn apart by internal ethnic, cultural, political, and religious conflicts triggered by these external powers. If these problems were not addressed, poverty and hunger would not be resolved either. Without the capacity to build and maintain the necessary production and distribution systems, these African countries would not be able to produce enough to feed their people.
Generally, for a loan, forgiveness means that the loan is cancelled and that you no longer owe that money. So in the context of student loans, the forgiveness amount is the amount you will not be required to pay.
This doesn’t apply to your average daddy’s or mum’s little corner shop, but big companies like banks usually operate on a global scale, and even if their origin and global HQ isn’t in the US, they’ll still have dealings there. So they either pay the fine or stop trading with the US. Many opt for the former, but you can see companies threatening to leave if, for example, the legislator introduces a new set of regulations. Edit: I found the American branch. It’s called Commerz Markets and is based in New York. This is their website: https://www.worldwide.commerzbank.com/en/home/inhalte/ Niederlassungsseite_5555_jsp
Here's an example. Imagine that you're in the fourth grade and you sell candy. You have twenty classmates, and ten of them like candy. So your potential market is 10 students. Now, if you sell each candy bar for $1, that's 10 potential buyers. Your potential market is worth $10. But your classmates are so fond of candy that they each buy two candy bars every day, so your market is actually worth $20. That's how much you sell each day. Now, since there are 180 school days in a year, that makes your market worth $20 a day, or $3,600 a year. That's your local market, and it's worth $3,600 a year. Now, there are about 87,000 elementary schools in the United States, and you'll find kids selling candy bars in every one of them. There are 87,000 x $3,600 = $315 million. That's the total value of the candy-bar industry in the fourth grade. But in any industry there are many local markets, so I'm assuming that there is only one product in the industry. Now, you can apply this formula to the electric-car industry. If you do a bit of careful research, you can figure out how many people are currently interested in buying an electric car, and you can figure out how that number will change in the future as prices rise. You can make a rough estimate of the value of the industry.
A bond is like a loan. The government or a company borrows money from the buyer and pays an interest on it. Say you buy a 10-year bond at 5% interest per year. Five years later, you may want to invest in something else, or maybe you want to switch your money from stocks to bonds. The bond markets are where you can sell your bond to other investors, or where investors who want to buy bonds can buy them other than directly from the issuer. The prices of bonds fluctuate with the rate of interest, so that the market-based yield equals the coupon rate plus the rate of interest, based on the risk of the bond. Bonds that pay less interest than the prevailing rate sell for less than their face value, and those with higher interest sell for more.
Getting a lot of money attracts attention. If someone is willing to give you a lot of money, then it has to be for something legal. One can sell them something worthless and get a lot of money for it. But the value of this something must be subjective, otherwise it would be clear what one was doing. The value of art is subjective, therefore it can be used for money laundering.
- There is. Humulin is also generic under the name of Lispro. But it's a recent generic. Because when a new drug is developed in the USA, the generic cannot be done for twenty years. Humulin was developed at the end of the nineties, so it is now just getting rid of the protective mask. The other major complication is that insulin technology has changed a lot since the nineties. The nineties had a very bad result with the already available types of insulin. Do you know that in the nineties they were still using crushed pancreases from animals for diabetes? The drug companies spent billions of dollars on developing new, better and cheaper forms of insulin. They did not have any good artificial ones. In the noughties, the situation has changed a lot. They have long-acting, medium-acting, very concentrated, etc. These all allow both patients and doctors to better control blood sugar than just a moment of humulin. And since these have been developed recently, it will take many years before there are generics for them.
But exclusive economic zones are only for countries with a coastline. Mongolia or Rwanda therefore don’t have them. And it’s quite simple, every country has its own exclusive economic zone if it is 200 miles from the coast. If the exclusive economic zone of two countries overlaps, they simply share the territory. So, for example, if there were two countries separated by a sea that was 300 miles wide, each would have an exclusive economic zone of 150 miles if they shared it equally.
Atrocious overproduction and (presumably, at least where you live) sufficient facilities. If you need a certain quantity of something each day, but you can have ten each day, and you can have ten more if necessary from the place next door, then you can never run out.
It's because most games with micro transactions have a different business model: "free to play" or "freemium". Free to play means that games are free or have a symbolic value of $ 1 - 5, and make money from micro transactions. The other business model is to make customers pay more for the game and make the most money in one go. One of the two business models may seem more popular for you than the other depending on your gaming habits, but that's not true. Free to play and freemium games are the rule on mobile devices, and consoles and PC games are the rule on consoles and computers. Both business models are profitable.
A lot of manufacturing has gone over to just-in-time logistics over the last half-century. The idea is that instead of having a large warehouse where you can store a lot of the raw materials you need for the factory and all the goods produced, you instead make sure that your inputs arrive just in time for when you need them and that your output is ready to go to the next factory just in time for it to be picked up. There are a lot of advantages to this, including a shorter time-to-market, no costs for warehouse space and so on. Just-in-time logistics only works when you can predict future supply and demand. If you ordered a new webcam because your old one broke, then it would be too late to start ordering cobalt ore from Congo to be refined and sent around the world to produce your webcam. The companies need to predict that someone is going to buy the webcam at around that time, and they have to make sure it's available when you order, or at least closer to the end of the supply chain. But what's been happening for the last year and a half is that global supply and demand has been too volatile for anyone to make a reliable prediction. And the entire system of global logistics is so precisely fine-tuned for profit that any small hiccup can result in world-wide shortages.
What you are referring to is generally called the labour theory of value, and it has at its core the idea that the value of a thing is defined by the socially necessary labour which went into its production. Thus, the inherent natural value of a thing, say a litre of water, plus the labour of making it, bottling a litre of water, produces some sort of approximation to the value of the thing itself, a bottle of water. But this does not necessarily translate into the price of the thing, as Marx himself theorized on the problem of the transformation of the value of things into their prices, and in the reverse that the wages for labour which are paid to labour are not necessarily equal to the value of labour when that labour is applied to transforming a good. This is about as far as you can go without getting very very deeply into the general theory of value and prices, which is beyond the scope of ELI5 but suffice to say that the theory of value as it is understood by the labour theory of value is at best a controversial one.
- A stock's price is objective (though constantly changing during the trading hours). A stock's value is subjective and is calculated by each individual person, depending on various things, including the price, but also on the company, the industry, the products, the management, the strategies, etc.... If someone says a stock is overvalued, he's just saying an opinion. He means that the average value most people give the stock is too high, and therefore it is bought at a price above the "true" value (true for the person who is saying this). If a stock is truly overvalued, its price is likely to go down when the value of most people changes.
The Department of Education will give money to the states, and the states will give money to the schools, which will reduce the fees they charge for pre-k. Many states currently pay for 3 hours a day of pre-k, and this will give them the money to pay for the full day, including lunch.
What it actually is: it is only the meeting of the World Economic Conference, a rather ordinary conference. The main thing is to discuss changes that can be made for the betterment of society, to come together to negotiate, and so on. What conspiracy theorists think it is: it is the backdrop to the meeting of the powerful, intellectuals, and privileged individuals, who will converge to take power by pretending to be for the common good, but in fact consolidating their own power. It's nothing new, every ten years or so there's a new 'the powerful elite is meeting to take over the world'. It used to be the Council on Foreign Relations, or the Bilderberg Group, or the World Trade Organization. It makes a kind of sense that it is exactly how a powerful elite would consolidate its power, by meeting together, making secret plans, and claiming to make only innocuous public plans. And it is true that history is full of things that seem good for the common people on paper but turn out to be terrible for them. So it's probably a bad idea to call it the big reset, because it makes it sound like the old things will be wiped out and replaced with new things, and for conspiracy theorists, the old things not only still work, but taking them away would make them worse. But it must be said that it's not like that. It wasn't like that when it was the Council on Foreign Relations, and it isn't like that now. Don't fall for the conspiracy theorists' mumbo-jumbo. If you want to laugh at them, laugh from afar.
The fact that the USA doesn’t have free medicine, so they pay what people in other countries would pay if the money didn’t go to...
Imagine you've invented ice cream and an ice cream maker. Now you go to the bank and ask for a loan, since you don't have the money for milk because you spent the money you had on the invention itself. The bank doesn't know what an ice cream maker is, nor does it understand the concept of ice cream, and it doesn't expect to get anything out of the deal. Imagine now that ten people are so taken by your ice cream idea that they offer you money to buy milk, because they have confidence in your invention and are willing to exchange the money for shares in the event that X number of other people are as taken with it as they are. Now you have milk and no debt (since you've sold shares, you don't owe money to these people, you've actually sold them shares), and your business can go on. Generally, banks don't like to lend to fledgling companies, and established companies don't like debts. For people over five, shares are like real estate: there are lots of different classes of shares, including shares with debts or “convertible bonds,” with different rights, etc. Not just anyone can buy your shares or sell them.
OSHA is responsible for safety and health. A union also fights for fair pay, paid leave, and so on.
Those artists, programmers, writers and so on have all signed a contract that says that “everything they make during the course of their employment with the company is the property of the company” when they were hired. If you don’t want to give the company ownership of your creations, don’t work for a company that does that. But since most companies work that way, it would be very difficult to find a job.
I don’t think this works for companies, but it does for individuals. Suppose you’re Jeff Bezos, with $200,000 in shares in Amazon but with a modest salary of $80,000 (which is how much he actually makes). So if you want to buy a big house, you have two ways to go about it. One is to sell shares so you have enough cash to buy the house. But then your income will rise a lot and you’ll be taxed on the sale of shares. ... A lot. Two is to borrow money against the shares. You let the bank charge you on a portion of the shares and you use that to buy the house. As you haven’t sold the shares, you have no income and therefore no tax. Anyone can do this if they have an asset they can give as security to the bank—like shares. Like houses. Like jewelry. Etc., etc.
Black friday is just a different way of displaying their merchandise. Even the prices you pay are more than what it costs to produce and deliver, with the exception of some rare loss leaders. Black friday focuses on quantity, not profit per unit. If I sell a sandwich for $5, and I normally sell it for $10, I make $5 per sandwich. If I sell five a day, I make $25. On black friday, I sell the same sandwich for $8. That's only $3 profit per sandwich, but I sell 20 sandwiches. I make $60, which is much better than my normal day. It's a bit more complicated in the real world, but for ELI5 I think it's enough.
It is because not every price increase is a bubble. You cannot know that something is in a bubble. There can be a new normal. If "the market corrects itself" turns out to be "this asset was much too cheap and will go up even more" then waiting is a mistake. If you wanted to get into cryptocurrencies a few years ago but were waiting for the insane bubble prices of over a thousand dollars per coin to finally come down to a reasonable two-dollar price... well, you would still be waiting today.
If a restaurant’s price rise causes it to lose business, it may lower its prices to try to be competitive again. Otherwise it’s difficult to imagine a situation where a business would voluntarily lower its prices permanently.
You may not want to work when you are old? to work to the point of death is not something most people strive for. At that time you need some kind of financial support, and there are many ways to arrange this, depending on where you live. A pension is a savings and insurance together. You pay in, the money is invested and you get a monthly payout once you reach a certain age. It is usually more effective than letting the money sit in the bank, because a) it earns interest for you and b) it is independent of your length of life. How would you budget $300,000 when you are 70 years old and can live anywhere between 5 and 30 years?
Sell the old house for a profit, and that will help you to pay the old mortgage. For instance, if you had a $200,000 mortgage, and you sell the house for $250,000, you can still afford a down payment of $100,000 on the new house.
One must understand that the unemployment rate is “people with jobs divided by people who want to work.” If you are out of work but not actively looking for a job, you are no longer counted as part of the workforce and therefore do not count as unemployed. In this way, it is possible that there are more and more people who don’t want to work but unemployment doesn’t go up.
One of the things people don’t understand about national debt is that most of it is owed to private citizens. If you have money to invest, one of the things you can do is buy government bonds. If you do this, the government will give you the money back (with interest in 1, 10 or 30 years), but you also have to pay them interest on the money you borrow. There is no reciprocal debt from the government to you. If the government should stop making interest payments, you would lose your money.
Because they deal with the real instruments that have value—stocks and bonds. When you own a stock you own a piece of a company. You have a right to its profits and assets. A bond gives you the right to be repaid in the future with interest. These are the basic instruments of financial markets, and they deal with them through a variety of tools. Unlike Ponzi schemes, however, the underlying instruments produce value. Companies produce goods and services and thus profits.
It is not a company, it is a technology. There is an organization called the BlueTooth SIG that is in charge of the standards, but it is a non-profit association of 35,000 companies. It doesn't sell anything and doesn't make any profit. It's just a meeting place for the manufacturers to get together and be sure that the products will be compatible and that the consumers will know that the products will be compatible. Generally speaking, the introduction of standards like Bluetooth reduces the risk of monopolies, since consumers are much freer to choose among different vendors' solutions.
Why? Because that’s how restaurants operate. At a fast-food restaurant, you pay for the whole meal up front, but in a proper restaurant, people constantly ask for more drinks, desserts, etc., thus causing the bill to rise. If you’d paid for the whole thing up front, you might have felt less inclined to order a second drink, dessert, etc.
This question is very close to violating rule number four, so I will first answer it as you asked and then in the more proper way. Non-technical language: The 2008 financial crisis was caused by the banks loaning money to people who couldn’t afford the loans they signed up for. This “subprime” lending eventually led to a big wave of mortgage defaults in 2006 and 2007. This was a problem for the whole US economy because all the hedge funds and other banks were trading debt between each other in order to make a profit by betting on the future value of the debt. (I might be wrong about this.) As the number of defaults went up, the people who had invested in the mortgages started losing too much money and that caused a huge loss in value and therefore more defaults. The domino effect I mentioned above led to job losses all across the economy which exacerbated the problem even more. To a five year old: Banks have some pretend money that they lend out to people so they can buy a house. They decide how much a person can borrow by how much they make and how much debt they already have. But the banks were lending to people who didn’t have any business borrowing as much as they did and who couldn’t ever pay it back. So the banks and all the other people who were investing in the loans and making money from the interest started losing a lot of money because the people couldn’t pay it back. All these people losing money basically control the whole economy, so when they lost money, the economy crashed.
Not necessarily. The buyer is not always the seller, and the seller is not always the buyer, unless they are moving into a rental. Besides, the market is local. So a buyer/seller in one market is not necessarily a seller/buyer in that market.
We can convert the natural resources that exist into a more useful form. And we can discover new ideas that make the work easier. For example, rocks turn into concrete. A building is worth far more than rocks. Someone can discover how to build a digital computer. This is a new wealth. Another can discover how to build a digital computer with a smaller amount of material. This is new wealth.
This is a question of economics rather than science, and so it depends on where you are. The most important point is that more people want the end product, so the demand for it is greater, the supply of producers is greater, the price falls. In order to sell an item with a small profit, such as end sugar, a factory must sell a great deal of it, while with base sugar, which is sold in smaller quantities, the profit has to be larger to yield a similar revenue. Also, some countries restrict the parts of the cane that can be grown as raw sugar and may insist on the specific name.
Well, all those who work for the government will probably not be paid on time, even if they’re on critical duty and still have to go to work (they’ll still be paid, just not until the shut down is over). Military personnel usually still get paid, either through sympathetic banks or emergency authorizations to pay only military personnel until the shut down is over. Then there are services that aren’t deemed critical that won’t be available, like national museums, national parks, and other services. The US Postal Service, for example, will still operate, although it will be without pay until the shut down is over.
In the grand scheme of things, the degree of wealth and poverty between the different parts of the world has not varied all that much. Great civilizations have risen and fallen, bringing prosperity and wealth to various parts of the world. China was often one of the richest regions in the world, the Middle East was an economic power during the classical and Islamic period, and Africa had some wealthy kings, etc. But America has generally lagged behind in wealth. Why this has been the case is a bit complicated. Not only does the ocean between them restrict trade and technology (important trade links were established between Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North/East Africa) but there is also the theory that the lack of tameable work animals in America seriously affected the labor potential of the native tribes. In the meantime, animals tended to replace humans in agricultural labor, which led to more jobs in commerce, industry, and the arts. It was only with the advent of the industrial revolution that Europe was able to surpass the other parts of the world in technology and wealth. According to Maddison (a British economist), by the year 1600 China and India accounted for 51.4% of the world's GDP, but their population was only 47.5%, so they were not only bigger, but also richer than the average population. India's share of world GDP in 1600 was 22.7%, in 1820 it was 16.1%, and in 1870 it was only 12.2%. But India did not get poorer; the growth of their economy was still 22% in the sixteenth century and 21% in the seventeenth. The difference was that Europe's growth was too great. Similar things happened to the rest of the world. So the real question is why did the industrial revolution start in England and not in another country, and why did it happen only in Europe? That's really a very difficult question to answer. There were a number of factors, such as the agricultural revolution in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the easy availability of coal, the political situation, etc. Once the industrial revolution had taken off, Europe was able to use its technology and wealth to conquer and annex the rest of the world. The countries that Europeans settled (such as America, Australia, and New Zealand) became rich, but the countries that were settled and exploited (such as Africa and India) did not receive the technology and wealth to start their own revolution until several centuries later. That means their development lags far behind Europe and the countries it colonized.
The price can decrease when there is more demand, but that means that the supply must increase accordingly. The more something is wanted by people, the more they are willing to pay for it.
Because crude oil prices move up and down, they're buying oil they won't get for a long time yet, not just the stuff they're selling now, and there's the law of supply and demand at work. Take this as an example: Suppose you sell rubber balls. Every day you take your twenty-dollar bill to the ball manufacturer and buy twenty dollars' worth of rubber balls and sell them for thirty at a park. Then one day the manufacturer tells you that next day, the balls will cost thirty. So you buy twenty dollars' worth, but you know that the next day they're going to cost you thirty and you'll have to have the money to pay for them, and you need your ten-dollar profit to pay your bills. So you increase the price of the balls from thirty to forty. Then your profit is twenty dollars, but the next day you can afford to pay thirty, since that's the new price. It's the same with oil. When oil goes down, the gas stations don't just drop their prices as quickly as oil. They drop them more gradually, so they can make more profit.
It is because the English language uses the Latin alphabet, including the natural letters J, V and W, which have a counterpart in Latin. Now the Latin alphabet was perfectly adequate for the Latin language, but it doesn't have some sounds that other languages, including English, use. So many languages that use the Latin alphabet add diacritics to extend the alphabet. For example, Czech and Lithuanian are two examples of this method. Why some languages add diacritics and others use digraphs is a question I cannot answer. But it is an interesting question.
This means son. Just as English names often end in son, Scottish names often start with mc, Irish names often start with o, Spanish names often end in ez, Arabic names often start with ibn or bin, etc.
*p is a suffix. Why couldn’t *p have been a suffix? It may or may not be possible to reconstruct their meanings, but the whole of PIE, PS, PAA, etc. is full of such monoconsonantal suffixes. I agree that the PS form is probably inherited, based on many similar words in PAA. And for that matter, PIE and PAA have an enormous number of cognates (compare for example PIE *h2ówis for sheep with PAA *aw for goat or sheep, or PIE *men- for to be, to remain with PAA *mun for to be, to remain).
Haha, the Finnish text is my MA thesis. My advisor and I wrote a more general defense, which was published in the first volume of the [Brill's International Journal of Eurasian Linguistics (https://www.brill.com/view/journals/jeal/vol_1_no_1] (https://www.brill.com/view/journals/jeal_1_1_article_p46.xml). I'm probably not allowed to do so, but I can send you an initial draft of the dissertation when I get home. In short, there are several very strong arguments to support the initial position of the front vs. back.
[This post] by Geoff Lindsey mentions this. There is also a variety of RP still more distinct from modern LOT, namely //, that is, low, unrounded and short (i.e. different from PALM only in length). Yes, that’s it.
another posting which makes controversial statements without attribution and which may or may not represent the views of some of the named experts. It also cites debates that may or may not be ongoing, or have been settled for decades.
It’s strange; there shouldn’t be a c, because there wasn’t one in the Middle English aqueinten. I suppose someone decided to be exact with Latin, so they stuck in the c, since it comes from the Latin accognitre, which has a c. I suppose they didn’t remove the q either, thinking it would be too drastic. It may have been thought that it would follow words like acquire, since their Latin and Middle English roots already had a c, so that it is not a mystery why acquire has a c.
The Greek prefixes for the first four numbers do not derive from Greek. When the run of new stems was exhausted, people then turned to the “method of numbers” and took the Greek prefixes.
I think you underestimate the difficulty of coming up with a new research topic in such a well-studied language as Japanese. But if you have to find out about it on Reddit, it may be a while (as in years) before you have the background and resources to add something original to the discussion.
Your program will be tailored more to Spanish, with perhaps some overlap in other romance languages. It will probably be more focused on practical linguistics, but that doesn't mean it won't have good theoretical material. The same is true for a school's hispanic literature program.
I am curious to know how one can conclude that there is less imperialism in a language compared with that of the two greatest empires in the world (England and Spain). Am I missing something here?
It's the same in French and Spanish, but it's written more conservatively to preserve the traces of the Latin language.
I heard Persian for the first time from some Persian-speaking foreign students in my first year in university. Since then I’ve heard it several times, but I still think the same. It sounds gentle and supple to me, better than the popular languages such as French, Japanese, and so on. Arabic, on the other hand, sounds harsh. I’m not saying that Arabic is a bad language. And I have to say that I find the song you mentioned very boring. But the Persian music you heard was very enjoyable.
The same as the question: what was the first thing in the world? Is it money? Probably, but I do not know exactly when. The French language was probably based on base 20, as we see in the higher numbers — for example, 70=soixante-dix (sixty-ten) and 90=quatre-vingt-dix (four-twenty-ten).
I don’t know what institution this might be, but generally it’s nonsense. Yes, phonetics is different from other central departments of linguistics because it is an etetic discipline and *very empirical. It’s not the case that linguists and phoneticians disagree about methodology but not about theory: they’re two different disciplines. I don’t think there’s any serious inter-disciplinary rivalry between phoneticians and phonologists; they seem to get along well. Do you really mean that phonetics and philology are at odds with each other? There’s a point in arguing that in some respects and in some cases there is a rivalry between philologists and linguists.
How odd, that last phoneme is very rare. Perhaps it's a loanword? Could you please post your results as text? I can't make out the last phoneme. Is it ew?
I have no idea. But have you looked on YouTube?
It’s probably Frisian.
General American. It’s a conglomeration of accents that’s popular across the country and includes California and Ohio. It’s even a target for some second language learners who want to acquire an accent.
When I hear certain Dutch dialects my brain thinks it ought to understand, but I don’t understand.
The prepositions?
It's not that big a deal, fortunately. I speak more languages without gender than those with gender. Even between French, Spanish and Italian, there are many nouns that are not the same gender, and they are all derived from Latin. It's not really the language's root, but the culture. Even among the Germanic or Nordic languages, it is also difficult to get along. The only thing that is more or less the same is the languages that do not have gender distinction, such as English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
I’m a linguist who has studied Austronesian Alignment. I think it’s beautiful. But it’s also interesting that the speakers themselves don’t have to know about it. They do know about it intellectually. Would it be useful to go into it further? Q: To the best of my knowledge, all or most of the Philippine languages have fully developed systems of focus. A:
Neither. I’m a native speaker and a linguist, and as far as I know, the only meaning of the word “friendship” is “the relation between friends.” Because English is a Germanic language and compounds are quite common, one might well infer from this that it was a ship “for friends,” or that a ship could be “a friend.” But that would be poetic or a pun, which would require some context, so I would say monosemantic.
How read-able your writing is depends a lot on who you intend to read it.
In Spanish the gender is sometimes changed, sometimes it is not. This is a matter of personal taste and choice. There are many examples of both. Sometimes the singer is a narrator, so it doesn't matter if the gender doesn't match the singer. Sometimes the singer acts as a character, and then it's okay if the gender is changed to fit the singer.
Sound symbolism? The specific case in your examples would be an iconism, I think.
I would advise examining the construction of the novel and how it is translated. For instance, you could take note of the place where the object is described in the novel, and look at how the two languages use spatial prepositions.
Well, that sounds very interesting. Can you give some examples?
The English // is /t/ or /d/. In my native language, Portuguese, // is always a rhotic, spelled R. I knew a girl from Brazil whose name was Moara; she taught us Americans how to say it perfectly by pronouncing it like “Moata” or “Moada”.
There are over seven thousand languages in the world, of which the great majority is underdocumented. A book of this kind on all languages is therefore unthinkable. If you want a good introduction to *some* languages, you might like to try The World's Major Languages, by Bernard Comrie.
Have you looked at the article on the wiki, the movie, or the song? Each of these has a list of references and external links to do more research.
yes, they are called reference grammars.
[This one?]
I think you're closer to the truth than you know. A consonant and the vowel that follows or precedes it are not discrete entities, but are formed by a smooth transition as the tongue and other parts of the mouth slide into their proper positions. The vowel will "weave" into the consonant, as it were. For instance, when the Mandarin x, k, j is said, the tongue is in a position analogous to that for a //, so it goes from there. Similar transitions occur with the p, t, k, but they are not so easily noticed. This warping of vowels during the transition is one of the auditory cues that come from the tongue; each point of articulation has its own. (They are particularly important with the voiceless consonants, since there is no ejective burst to help distinguish them.)
Distinctive features: Jakobson, R., Fant, C. G., & Halle, M. O. (eds.). (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1960). The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Vol. 27, No. 2, pp. 338–352. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 447–55. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Vol. 23, No. 4, pp. 675–690.
No "more objectively better" or "more objectively worse" grammar, morphology, etc. All languages can communicate, but some have less common grammar, morphology, etc. Even some widely studied languages have uncommon features:  and  (the so-called "th" sound in English) are in fact rare phonemes in languages.
Basically a job translating documents. But if you don’t want to work for the government, then don’t. It’s also not an easy job to get.

Could it be that many Guatemalans are bilingual in Spanish and some indigenous language?
It's probably one of three things. * Some weird typographic accident. Completely unintentional. * * * * They were looking for a slash, but couldn't find one and decided to use this instead.
In the Basque language, there is no difference between the Spanish spoken in Zamora and Vitoria except for some of the usages, such as good day (agur) and thanks (eskerrik asko), congratulations (zorionek), and a few more specific things. (A change in the spelling of certain words from Ch to Tx and from K to C.) One could say that the difference lies in the accent, which is recognizable to natives, but to a Spaniard from the south, both would be simply “Northern accents.” Spanish has dominated for several centuries now, so it can hardly be called a recent phenomenon.
The air must be pushed in from the back of the tongue without going over it, and the tongue must vibrate against the lower lip. As far as I know, it's impossible.
What doesn't she know if she's a university teacher? For one thing, Google Scholar, but you have to know what you want to read... If she doesn't have an institutional ID, there's always Sci-Hub.
There is a great book by Walt Wolfram and Natalie Schilling called American English that contains a chapter on African-American English and may be useful to you as a general introduction. For more focused reading you might want to check out The Labov Report: Language in the Inner City. These two books would probably be good places to start, but they can get very linguistically technical. So if you are not already well versed in the field, perhaps some of the other recommendations would be more appropriate for you.
A political party is a group of people. Like in a restaurant you ask for a table for four.
What kind of linguistics are you interested in? If you like the historical linguistics, there is John McWhorter's 'Language Family of the World' on Kanope and Prime.
Look at cases of creolization wherein pidgins grow into real languages as a result of children learning them as a mother tongue. There's the fascinating example of Nicaraguan Sign Language, which came out of a group of deaf children in Nicaragua.
usually, the word edition is synonymous with version, that’s why it’s called a ‘version.’
There are leaps here that confuse you. 1. The principle of loyalty does not preserve markedness. Faithfulness preserves resemblance with the underlying form. It has nothing to do with markedness. If it did, we wouldn't have to think of the principle of loyalty at all. We would describe everything in terms of the principle of markedness. 2. "Since the principles of markedness reduce the number of marked features" - that is only true if the principle of markedness takes precedence over the principle of loyalty. Remember that the OT principles are erroneous, just like the traffic regulations, where it is punished more severely for more serious violations, and where certain violations are enforced more strictly. The principle of markedness can only reduce the number of marked features if it occupies a higher position in the system. Thus, markedness can increase or decrease over time depending on the way the system is organized. 3. "I'm thinking that markedness and information are something like synonyms here. " There is no reason to think so. VC is a more marked syllable structure than CV. They are equally possible syllable structures. They do not differ in how much information they convey. Markedness has nothing to do with information.
yes, many, and most of them distinguish also between x and.
Parthian and Middle Persian coexisted. Middle Persian is an ancient language and is part of the family of southerly Persians. It evolved into the modern Persian language, and thus is a southern Persian language, while Parthian, probably, left no direct descendants but nevertheless left a mark on the linguistic sphere of the great culture of Iran, especially Armenian, which may have more loanwords of Parthian origin than Persian. And that is why we know so much about Parthian from Armenian. Thus we can say that Parthian, which had a longer life in the Caucasus than in Iran itself, lingered a while longer there and then disappeared without leaving any direct descendants. It had a significant influence on Armenian, and to a lesser extent on Persian.
Persian. There are many Persian words in Turkish that have been so well camouflaged that it would amaze you.
With a short read and a short read... I understand the whole problem with all caps to be that ascenders and descenders help readers to quickly split words and all caps text lacks this information. From what I've read, I don't allow acronyms without tagging the full name or phrase, because not everyone knows what they stand for (and they also have a problem with all caps, because it doesn't have a handle). A quick search on typography and linguistics shows some academic articles on this subject, so it looks like someone has already done something in this area. Is this right?
I don’t know if there is a special word for a greeting, but the word for phrases that are uttered more for the sake of common social acts than as a means of actually conveying information is called a “phatic expression.”
According to Edmund Gussmann, "trz" is a "consonant combination which is not an affricate," he introduced the symbol [t-] for trz, and [t] for cz. [t] is an affricate, while [t-] is a consonant combination where a plosive is followed by a fricative. * Should it be [t-] without the overhang? I would use the "Wikipedia transcription": * cz * - [t], trz * - [t] / - [t]?
In Asia, the Chukchi female dialect is distinguished from the male dialect in a number of unpredictable ways, especially with regard to an alternation between r and c or. The alternation is not arbitrary, but the result of an asymmetrical collapse of three different elements into two: in male Chukchi, *r and *d go to r, and *c goes to s, but in female Chukchi, *r goes to s and *d and c go to c.
Basically a capital C represents a consonant, but the exact consonant is uncertain, or the author may not have given the sound for some reason. And a capital V represents a vowel. Hyphens are a way of indicating the end of a morpheme. In this case it’s possible the author is unsure if the sound should be a k or a t, or something else, since the contact languages have such different forms.
I think it's true. Maybe the only point that could be made here is that it would be more interesting if this statistic learning stuff was used to test hypotheses about the role of statistics in human language ability. There's a good example of this. But I think Chomsky is right that if you are using statistics to make machines that simulate learning, then you aren't really interested in the question of how human language works.
“Free variation” is close, although it doesn’t always refer to pronunciation alone, and sometimes to the way individual speakers pronounce words. However, we could easily say that many pronunciations are free to vary in a language community.
Yes, that is just because you are a native and the script has been engraved in your brain for so many years. Just keep in mind that some of the Latin letters did not originally have the sounds they have today. Latin script has been adopted over the centuries from one language to another, it is not even from an Indo-European language.
You mean "lateral plosives"; what you are thinking of is "lateral ejective."
Japanese people sometimes make puns using numbers. An example of a particularly twisted one is: “Three nines”... “three nines”... “thanks”
It’s an accusative personal pronoun. It is the object of the preposition in.
Quite a number of Latin male nouns, including many names, end in “us,” but “Satan” isn’t Latin. It’s the English name of a Christian specter based on Jewish myths—a name that came to us from Hebrew via Latin and Greek and was spelled in three different alphabets along the way, alphabets that don’t map on exactly to our modern alphabet. So it’s pointless to argue about how it “should” be spelled. The word “should” isn’t something linguists arbitrate, and it’s been spelled “Satan” in English ever since it was first spelled.
First, I would recommend the book, “Determinateness” by Lyons. A complete work, but still easy to read. Second, the proposition that “articles are necessary to meaning” and “the articles are necessary to meaning” actually imply two different things. The first is definite. The second is vague. The first means that you are referring to definite objects; they have been introduced in the conversation, or are generally known; therefore, they are not just articles, but articles. Let’s say it binds the variable of the reference. Then, this binding may or may not be externalized according to language. Some languages have articles, others do not. But the feature “definiteness” exists in any case.
First-born girl would literally mean the first-born girl. In the Sioux language, Winona means the firstborn, eldest daughter. Edit: Jewish Passover tradition contradicts this interpretation.
'A' is a shortened form of 'da' or 'de,' which still occur in western Jamaica. Where those words come from is not certain; but an English dialectal form of the same meaning da or even the word there itself may have been the original source. (Again, note that it does not indicate 'future', but is used as a marker of non-stativeness.)
This is a false dichotomy. Creolization is no longer possible in most of the world, where creoles were once formed and widely spread. Creolization is not “becoming more and more local”, and it is uncertain what is meant by “more or less creolized”. But creoles are no longer being formed in the Anglophone regions of the third world. The questioner seems to have the idea that decreolization means moving towards US or UK English. I do not know why this impression was formed, but it is incorrect. Decreolization (if the term is even useful) means the creole moving towards the lexifier it is in contact with, which is in the case of the English-speaking Caribbean, Caribbean English, not US or UK English. But if varieties of English are lost, they are more likely to be lost from the basilectal varieties than the acrolectal varieties. The English element is still very strong, and it acts in much the same way as it does in other countries around the world where there are no creoles.
Even if you don't speak French, at the end you'll still hear a few young native speakers of Valais patois.
Among the many examples is Spanish “nada”, a direct descendant of the word “born”, from the Latin nlla rs nta (literally: “not a born thing”), an extension of *nm ntus (“nobody”), literally: “born of nobody.” The Spanish participle of nacer, to be born, is nacida, so there is no homonymy here. All the parts of the same expression were separated out: French “rien”, Catalan “res”, with the same meaning.
Mandarin is rhotic, although the degree varies depending on the dialect. The rhoticity can be expressed as a consonant reduction:  (wen) is pronounced “wen”. The rhoticity can also affect the tone of certain words, such as  (zhaopianr) “photograph”. This tone change has even affected non-rhotic dialects of Mandarin.
“Experience” comes from the Old English word for “experience,” which in turn comes from the Latin word “experientia.” The e sound used to be pronounced eh and not ee. The pronunciation changed over time (which is what language does), but the spelling did not.
Cocaine is the devils own drug.
Excuses are studied in pragmatics as a type of speech act. I'm pretty sure there's not much cross-cultural semantic difference, but much more pragmatic difference in communicative situations and the corresponding schemas/scenes/scripts/norms (or whatever you call them, there are many different words for this concept). If we speak Japanese and I drop a pen, you pick it up and I say "Thank you. " It is usually translated into American English as "I'm sorry" or "I'm sorry," but it is culturally appropriate to say "Thank you" in American English. I asked a Japanese professor about this, and he said that "I'm sorry" and "Thank you" both recognize that the other party has done something for you. In the Japanese script of the situation, it is appropriate to apologize to the person who picks up the pen, but in the American script, it is appropriate to say "Thank you" for the same reason. This is a study of the meaning of "I'm sorry" in Japanese, and this study is a study of the meaning of "I'm sorry" in American English. I don't know any good articles, but I got a lot of them by searching for "cross-cultural studies of apologoy".
The rhythmic-syntactic relationship in Chinese is a two-volume book by Feng Shengli. It explains the vast number of facts about Chinese syntax with phonological concepts such as the so-called nuclear stress rule. Let's say that many languages have no influence on rhythm and phonology on syntax. Chinese is a special case in many respects.
I have three problems with it: (a) it doesn’t have proper (as far as I know) implementations; (b) it doesn’t allow for automatic recursive derivation of analyses from raw data; (c) it doesn’t have a way of modelling paradigms. A problem I have with practitioners is that they often don’t want to model whole systems, but only abstracted parts of them. An example of this is Muller’s analysis of Russian, which consists of 5 inflection classes. I do like some of its features, like the fact that it’s totally post-syntactic.
Input. It is an irritant.
This is really interesting, thank you for sharing.
The ease of learning a language does not necessarily follow the closeness of its genetic relationship. It is usually easier for an Englishman to learn Spanish than German, although the two are more closely related.
I recommend the collexification (https://clics.clld.org/) [introduction].
Answers for the US: 1. If you are a graduate student or an academic, there are still research fellowships and stipends that you can apply for. Those are still possible to get; many people still get them. The main problem you are going to run into is the lack of academic jobs. The vast majority of grad students will not get good academic careers. 2. The problem with getting a job so that you can do documentation is that you now have a job. Getting a Ph.D. in linguistics is not something you do while you have a job. 3. The question of whether you can do documentation while holding down a job depends on many things, but if you are outside the academic system, you will not have the same access to research grants, institutional support, or a network of fellow travelers. That does not mean it is impossible, but I do not want to give you the impression that it is likely. Most language documentation research is still done by academics and people who are part of the communities. Most linguists do have some theoretical questions they are trying to answer. It is harder and harder to make a name for yourself in US academics by publishing descriptive grammars; there are very strong incentives to publish papers that are deemed to be theoretically significant. There are also linguists who do a lot of documentation over the course of their careers, but who also have interests in the methods, tools, and technology of documentation. It is a depressing state of affairs. There is not no support for documentation, but there is less support for it than there should be, and much of that lack of support is due to the structure of US academics (graduate school timetables, lack of top jobs, publish or perish, etc.).
For example, if you want to do a page about what people call their evening meal, here it is:
(That would be a grammatical term.) But I think that means “to make something into a noun”—I mean, I think it means that (but I did not learn  when I was in college). The reader cannot know whether it is  or, which is a form of omitting a particle, and if you have to make the reader fill in the particles yourself, it takes a few milliseconds more to grasp the meaning, but it takes up less space in writing, so it is frequently used in places where space is limited. Newspaper titles, for example.
It is Taa, spoken in South Africa, 58 to 87 consonants, 20 to 31 vowels, and four tones. It is really a lot. Diktyoteka: It is not the language, but the dialect.
In the Berlin dialect /g/ takes on a fricative allophone [] after back vowels, and [j] after front vowels and approximants, and as a first-syllable allophone. Is that what you are observing?
> Secondly, what is the proper terminology for all this? Is there a special name for verb conjugations that give the pronoun as part of the ending, and those that do not? The term normally used for this phenomenon is "agreement." A verb AGREEs with one or more noun phrases in its own sentence. There is also a technical distinction between languages in which the verb marking appears only when there is no full noun phrase (such as in Latin where the third person ambulat is valid by itself as "he/she/it walks"), and those where the full noun phrase is also present with the verb marking (such as in puella ambulat, "the girl walks"). Only the second case is strictly speaking an agreement. When a full noun phrase can replace the verb marking, the verb marking is probably better seen as just a regular pronoun that has been tacked on to a verb. Note that in colloquial French, the former pronouns before the verb often occur with their own full noun phrases, which seems to imply that they have evolved from regular pronouns to real agreement markings. Is there a special name for languages that have this particular type of verb marking? I am personally not very fond of terms like "the X-language." It seems exoticizing and a bit like reducing a whole language to just one aspect of its syntax. The verb markings themselves are normally called affixes (or prefixes or suffixes, depending on where they occur), or just markings (though not all markings are affixes). There are also different types of markings depending on what they do; for example the -s in English ambulates is a marking for third-person subject agreement, while the -ed in English walked is a marking for past tense. In paradigmatic languages such as Latin, however, you often just talk about the form, the particular combination of grammatical features. If a marking cannot co-occur with a full noun phrase, it is probably a clitic pronoun. A clitic is a term that some people do not like, because it is not very well defined, but in this case it means something that is structurally a separate word, but that has the phonological properties of a part of a word. You will also see the term morpheme, which means "a single phonological unit that cannot be broken down into meaningful constituents." (Strictly speaking, this also includes lexical roots as well as phonological units, but normally when people think of morphemes they are thinking of grammatical units.) However, there is some discussion about whether this is always a clear distinction. First of all, is it more common for a language to need pronouns to be separate words, or for the verb markings to be in the form of an ending? Of the 378 languages in the World Atlas of Languages' sample (a small sample, but not surprisingly), a full two-thirds (278) have verbs that AGREE in some way with one or both of the noun phrases of their own clauses. At least on the basis of this sample, which is in general fairly representative of my impressions, languages that have verbs that AGREE are significantly more common than languages that do not. Do all languages fall into these two categories, or are there other possibilities? Some variations are: * Some languages can or do mark the verb in more than one place (this is called polypersonal agreement); usually only the two main arguments of a transitive verb are affected, while three or more is much less common (though colloquial French is a three-agreement language, to my knowledge). * Some languages have verb markings that appear only in some cases, but not in others (this is usually the result of former secondary markers having become parts of the main verb); * Some languages have verb markings that are applied only to certain noun phrases (for example, a secondary marker); * Some languages have a different agreement pattern: * The most common alternative to a distinction between the "subject" and the "object" (called the "nomination" pattern) is called the "ergative" pattern: instead of seeing the agent and the acted-upon as the same, it treats the single argument of an intransitive verb as the "patient" of a verb. (*) * There are probably also other possibilities. In general, a verb must have a subject. But with all these different ways of grouping arguments, the traditional "subject" is not a useful concept in a cross-linguistic sense. (*) And a wonderful world of linguistics opens up to you.
Firstly, I don’t think so. Secondly, according to the chronology given here, it seems unlikely.
.... America. Is it a nickname?
Japanese has a lot of words that can change from m- to n-, like sabisii and samisii. As for Tokyo-style d, I can’t think of a Japanese accent that uses n for d, but there are lots of places in Japan that prenasalise voiced consonants—meaning b, d, g, z—as if a short nasal (m, n) sound had come before them. *1 And it is a defining feature of the accents of these regions (which are mostly in the north). *3 The typo has been fixed, and a grammatical note is in order.
I can explain it real simple. English is a Germanic language redesigned and twisted by space aliens who wanted to screw with the people they knew were going to study linguistics. Write it down.
You should post it to /r/badlinguistics.
Flinka flushka is a flinka-flunk (rhymes with squirm) Russian word, already found in the nineteenth century. The second edition of the Dahl dictionary (1882) contains the variants: fintiklejka, fintifluffa. The etymology is unknown; it is, however, a new word, if we are to believe Vasmer, who said that it was based on the German alliterative pair "finten und flausen" ("fint and vanity").
yes, I'm quite disappointed by that article and all the other coverage I've seen so far. Guardian science coverage is normally not so bad. Normally they'd ask for other opinions, but here that didn't happen. I'm not sure why everyone reports this story so uncritically. Is it a lack of knowledge about linguistics? Is it because it's very exciting to put Japanese in the family of mysterious languages? Is it because they like the main author's nationalist theories? I'm a non-specialist interested in archaeology, and I think archaeology and genetics have made great progress in the last few decades, so I'm willing to accept they might have found something new in this case, but I'm sceptical about the linguistics. I'm hoping the Tides of History podcast will cover it - it's a good science podcast that popularises the deep past.
There are thousands of languages with less than 1 million speakers. Good luck in choosing one.
South Indian English has words like “only” and “itself” that are essentially like the clitics in Tamil. “Only” is pretty straightforward, but the word is used in a different way in Tamil, as a focus marker, which indicates that the referent is already part of the discourse. For example, “I myself came from there” could be interpreted as meaning “I have arrived only now.” “I myself came from there” could also mean “I actually came from the place we have been discussing.” Similarly, “itself” is quite intuitive. It is a contrastive focus marker, which makes the focus item contrasted with the others mentioned. Often it is used as a substitute for “after all.” So you would hear, “He stuck to the original plan itself,” meaning “He stuck to the original plan after he had a look at the other options.” “Paris itself has enough to do.” And “down” is like “-du-” in Tamil, or “-bi-” in Kannada. “Down is what I did. You did it so quickly?” That’s all I can think of. Hope it’s interesting.
They were originally ejective.
However, this is one of the words that are going through a change of meaning at the moment. Therefore, when I describe the grammar, you will probably find lots of examples in the net, in comments, etc., that go against it. However, is very similar in meaning to "but" - they both mean, or rather imply, a contrast. However, is grammatically a separate word. Normally it is the first word of a sentence or a clause, it comes after a full stop or a semicolon. However, is normally followed by a comma. This makes it a bit different from but, which does not always make a separate sentence. Examples: I wanted to go to the cinema but it was closed. or I wanted to go to the cinema but it was closed. However, a lot of people seem to disregard this, and you often find things like: She wanted to go running, however it was raining heavily. There is also a second use of however, as an adverb, I think! It is comparable to no matter how long, no matter how much, etc. This is not as common as the first use (however = but). Examples: No matter how I tried, the door did not open.
Not heard it in Australia. I didn’t know such a construction existed. I can think of nothing more closely related than “I ain’t”—as in “I ain’t going down there,”—which is rather common, but quite informal.
Substitute and substitute are both used in athletics. That suggests the word may be ambiguous enough to require amplification. I have always used the phrase “substitute” to mean “replace.”
The distinction between a and o in the words patte and pâte is attenuated in France. That means that most French dialects do not make the distinction, not that they are close when the distinction is made. Also, you made un and in even more dissimilar from the way at least I pronounce them than they already were. Finally, don’t generalize from your own pronunciation, especially if you’re not a native speaker. Also, I’m pretty sure that originality is forbidden on Wikipedia. The only good thing about your change is that, considering the state of French linguistics or English linguistics on French (in which it seems that everyone generalizes from their own dialect), you didn’t harm anything important.
You get different languages. But generally, anything that can't be encoded in the morphology is handled by analytic constructions (constructions like the English'make' construction plus morphological marking), or by increasing the lexical resources (adding more adverbial modifiers to the action). So, for example, Tamil has two causatives, one with an ambiguous morphological structure, the other fully inflectional. The first is a purely valency-changing operation, the second has more semantic content (but still stripped of a lot of it). So, *than-* means 'to run', *thann-* means 'to run something', and with the auxiliary *a-* (lex. meaning 'put') *thann-a-ve-* means 'to make something run', *thann-a-ve-* means 'to make something run something'.
I think you're mixing up the chronology. I think the date of the Exile is several centuries before the Arab conquest and the conquest of Islam, and the different pronunciation seems to have been present at that time. According to the article on the shift of the Canaanites in the Wikipedia: It is also in the Levantine dialects of the Arabic language, and the shift was also more complete in the northern part of the country. (See also: Arabic-Language Articles.) The following is from the Wikipedia article on the Phoenician language: This also seems to confirm that the shift was more complete in the north. Maybe the phonetic influence was even greater in Tiberias Hebrew.
Not what you're thinking but what people inadvertently do. When your father talks Irish, for example, he's unconsciously making a connection with that person, and he probably does it in gestures too. It's just a way of relating to people.
The best example I can offer you is precisely of the type: “L-has acquired a lot of -isms.” But please be patient. The language in question is Spanish and I think that what happened to it was very similar to what happened to many Western European languages. Up until the end of the Middle Ages, Spanish had developed quite naturally out of Vulgar Latin. A large number of German words had crept into Romance as early as the fifth century, and from the eighth century there had been a substantial influx of Arabic words, but they had been thoroughly adapted to Spanish phonology. In the thirteenth century, the first attempts were made to establish a standard language, and this meant that Latin-Latin spellings were used for many words, but whether the pronunciation of these words was actually changed is a matter of dispute. The sixteenth century saw a flood of Latin words into the language, as poets and writers, influenced by classical and Italian models, were wont to adopt old-fashioned forms and Latin words. It was different from earlier mass borrowings in that (1) it was deliberate, and (2) Spanish phonology was changed, since consonant clusters that had been simplified centuries before were now permissible. Thus words like abstracto, transformar, exacto, perfecto, maligno, admitir all entered the language, replacing older words. But the most interesting result was that a great many Spanish words with antepenultimate stress, like rezar, to pray, and recitar, to recite, raudo, “swift”, “rapido”, “siesta”, “six o’clock”, were introduced. *
The original upper-class English accent (20th century "elegance"), which ended most sentences with a vocal fry, was characterized by a lot of vocal fry. The last sound file on the next page, just above the clip of Jacob Rees-Mogg, demonstrates this. That's a woman, but it's still heard from older men.
Maybe. Two possibilities: he will have an accent, and, despite growing up in America, will never acquire the English of a native. He might end up with a rather hard-to-place accent. I have one friend with that sort of accent: he doesn't sound foreign, but he doesn't sound native either. People who have moved around a lot during their childhood can have a similar problem. This is unlikely and an unnecessary fear. If the child is brought up in the country of his target language, he is unlikely not to reach native-speaker level. I'm not familiar with studies of such conditions, but I don't think there's any reason to think that being a trilingual would prevent you from speaking American English. The whole notion that if you are trilingual you can't possibly acquire American English is a common misconception with a decidedly bigoted undertone. Not to suggest that people who have believed or spread this idea are bigots, but I'm just mentioning the elephant in the room. I have heard the suggestion that a polyglot's vocabulary in all languages is reduced, but not to the extent that he is prevented from speaking the target language with native fluency. Besides, monolinguals with native-speaker fluency rarely know the full vocabulary of their own language.
I used it for a master's thesis and was very satisfied. Just be careful if you go to a UK university, it's free to most public institutions in the EU, but the question of the transition.
the real deal is Hellen Keller. I don't know what to think of this ridiculous comment. Either you are a troll, or you are a really offensive ass.
This week's question: In Serafim & Shinzato (2020), they describe two very similar affixes *-t°i (linking/conjunctive) and *-t°ee (perfective non-conjunctive), where *-° denotes aspiration. While I accept that the second of these is long vowel, because of their thorough analysis of the metrical properties of the texts, I'm puzzled by their analysis of the first as having a short vowel. In the cited example sentences from the Omoroshoushi, the affixes and their allomorphs were spelled consistently as follows: * *-t°i & -t°eee *= *-ti & -tie *= / * *-cyi & -cyee *= / *-ti * & *-yi *=           * (Serafim & Shinzato do point out that this last case could be analyzed synchronically as *-ti * + yes/no particle *-yi *, but that this is not necessarily the etymology.)... So, what reason do they have for suggesting a distinction *-t°i vs. *-t°ee * between these two "t"-type affixes, rather than *-t°i vs. *-t°eee *? Does this distinction hold in other languages of the Northern Ryukyu?
It could be that this corpus is peculiar to this particular corpus. Have you read their documentation?
I honestly can’t decide whether language influences thought or thought influences language. Why should it have to be either/or? Noam Chomsky affirmed universal grammar, and his proof was Zipf’s law. Chomsky is still alive. A lot of facts follow a Zipf distribution. That is a statistical fact. The same is true in linguistics, but it has nothing to do with universal grammar. No. Where do you get that from? Zipf’s law suggests that all languages can be deciphered. This is ridiculous. Maybe someone working on an ancient manuscript or a hieroglyphic text uses Zipf’s law to try to decipher it, but that doesn’t make it a universal decipherer. It is hard to know where to begin to untangle your misunderstanding of Zipf’s law, but it is fairly extensive. You have given it much more significance than it deserves. But this study on the people of Namibia proves that language influences our perception of color. This experiment does not even test children’s ability to recognize colors. The experiment tested whether they could classify the colors in their memory. You are thinking of the experiment shown by the BBC where the Himba tribespeople had difficulty telling the difference between a green and blue square. But this BBC experiment never took place. That there have been some small demonstrations of the influence of language on thought, like this color recall experiment. But these influences are very small and might not be noticed outside a laboratory. We know that language does not determine thought, because we can think and feel things that we don’t have words for. The more profound questions of whether thought is structured like language or whether (and if so how) language influences our view of the world, cannot be easily tested. The vast majority of linguists that I know would reject any sweeping generalizations in this area.
It's just the normal l, or at least that's how I pronounce it, being a native and heritage speaker.
Look up “heritage learner” on the web. There are classes for people in your situation that make use of the knowledge you have in your head to ‘activate’ your Spanish skills.
I literally wrote a thesis about this. The actual subject of the thesis is r-nasalization in Hoocik, but on page 51 I put a table of all the languages I was able to find that have a nasalized tap in the alveolar region. (edit: link removed to avoid doxxing myself.)
It depends. The term pidgin has been used to designate the means of communication used by communities that would otherwise have no means of communicating with each other. Pidgins are not natural languages; they are artificial, so they are limited in expression. They may lack certain communicative functions because they are restricted to restricted circumstances. But any natural language, that is, any language that a community has learned as its mother tongue, is just as capable as any other of expressing ideas. Pidgins may become natural languages in some cases, and in such cases the native speakers will fill in the gaps so to speak, but the nature of the process is still controversial. The natural language is then sometimes called a creole, but then there are creoles that have never been pidgins, and there is some discussion among scholars of languages as to which term is more appropriate. Solomon Islanders’ pidgin is in spite of its name a natural language with its own mother-tongue speakers, albeit a much larger number of speakers of English as a second language. Solomon Islanders’ pidgin is not just a simplified form of English; in fact it has features not found in English, like clusivity. The difference between the two is that the second person plural in Solomon Islanders’ pidgin is always inclusive of the listener.
By analogy, I think, with the plurals of parentheses and hypotheses. It's also true of biases.
This symbol derives from a small et in the Latin of ancient Rome, (Et tu brute?) the apostrophe before the e. As it was sometimes used after the letter Z it has been counted as the 27th letter of the alphabet at some periods, and it would have been like the English 'a' and 'I' in being both a letter and a word except in the Latin language. It has been dropped from the alphabet of course, but is not uncommon in European languages, as Latin had a strong influence there. Now perhaps it has spread to other languages with the expansion of the world’s communications, and the ubiquity of the Internet. Here’s where to read more:
1. He literally cites a study that demonstrates that speakers of a gendered language have their perception of an object influenced by its gender. You can say that this has no connection to human gender, but it does, empirically, at least according to this study. 2. He explains how he couldn't find any convincing scientific explanations for grammatical gender, especially as he says only a quarter of languages have it. Of course he doesn't mention any literature, but a quick search on Wikipedia shows there's at least one study that confirms this. I do agree, however, that it's a bit unscientific and anglocentric for him to dismiss it as "useless". He never argues for abolishing grammatical gender, though. 3. After he finishes his quick summary of grammatical gender, he goes on to discuss how there is an "ungender" pronoun in English, which can be used to refer to people outside the gender-binary spectrum or just for cases when gender is either unclear or irrelevant. If he had argued for abolishing grammatical gender, he would've had to explain how English speakers would have to stop using the singular they and the few gendered words. 4. Even though the grammatical gender of other languages is kind of derided in this video, it is at least properly explained, with academic sources. You're not the only one who's been offended by this, which is why he had to close the comments section because of the irate speakers of gendered languages in it. But native speakers of gendered languages are probably also aware of the sense of absurdity that goes along with grammatical gender. As a French speaker, I know that it's sometimes joked about, and being corrected for using the wrong gender of a word as a child is confusing (even though this is also a prescriptivist issue). I don't really understand why you're getting so worked up over a three-minute video. He's not asking you to start speaking differently in your language because of his linguistic preferences (which is just to be more inclusive when referring to people of different gender identities, nothing particularly controversial). Besides, it's funny that you say "It would hardly make sense" when you've deliberately made sentences in English without articles in it. That being said, I do agree that the grammatical gender stuff isn't perfect. It detracts from the main message of the video, which is the singular they. But it's not just me who thinks so. Tom Scott has put a correction in the description, maybe you should have paid more attention? Anyway, it's understandable that you'd be offended because you're not the only one, but the whole thing isn't as bad as you're making out.
In UG, I'd recommend Mark Baker's 'The Natures of Non-Configurationality'. This is the paper that inspired me to become a linguist, fwiw. You can get it free from the internet. It looks at a number of languages that are quite different from English, and suggests that their differences follow naturally from universal grammar principles, which are applied in slightly different ways, with quite different surface features.
Does anyone know of Japanese universities with a strong linguistics program? When I checked, I found a lot of linguists in the Japanese department, but there were very few departments of linguistics.
I'm bad at all math and I like both phonics and syntax. The human brain is a funny thing. We all like different things and are good at different things.
Definitely. Beijing, for example. The “j” should sound like a “dz,” but everyone pronouns it like a French “j.”
Not all, but... complicated and incomprehensible case system, where a case can be expressed by many different endings, and one case by many different endings, depending on plurality, gender, form, etc. Decretion often alters the stem. The relationship between case and real-world usage is often vague and arbitrary. To the contrary, in Uralic and Turkic languages the relationship between cases and endings is more or less one-to-one, the functions of the cases are much more clearly delimited, stem changes are rare. The only caveat is that in these families the cases have many different forms, depending on vowel harmony, but their use is generally regular and intuitive.
In English, onomatopoeias are often made up on the spot. For the record, English natives will likely think your native onomatopoeias are delightful (and they may understand them anyway) so there’s no need to learn ours. But in my experience, there are English courses where they teach onomatopoeias. I know the Swedish words for quack and bark. There’s a list on Wikipedia and you can look them up by searching “sound a dog makes,” “sound a door makes,” etc.
Here's one: Oxford Words (searched with Google) for "gag": "Middle English, perhaps from Old Norse gagháls, 'neck thrown back', or imitative of a person choking." It could be an example of false onomatopeia, it may be a derivative of an old Norse word with no relationship to choking, but it could also be a real onomatopeia. That's the best I can do. But wait, I just found this:
I don't really have a question, but I'm having a minor existential crisis: I'm a language student, and have just finished my second year at university studying Slavic languages (major in Russian, minor in Serbo-Croatian). My native language is Dutch. In September I'll start the preparation for my final thesis, which I'll probably defend sometime later in the year or early next year. A few months ago I discovered that I was very interested in historical and comparative linguistics, especially when it comes to Balto-Slavic, after attending a basic lecture on the subject in our Slavic philology class (it dealt mostly with Old Church Slavonic). I'm particularly interested in the so-called "unexplained centumization" of certain Slavic words (Russian камен * k2em), and in general, everything that has to do with the Rk law, even when it comes to Slavic languages. I also think there are a few interesting research possibilities in this area. My main worry is this: I'm too late to the game. Is it too late for me to start studying this subject now, at the beginning of the academic year in which I want to do a final thesis on it? On the one hand, I'm very happy that after what feels like forever (two years) I've finally found a field and subject that interest me, and that I don't have to settle for something that's only halfway interesting to me. But at the same time I feel like I'm really far behind most of my friends and colleagues, who already knew what they wanted to study when they started and had a whole year to explore and prepare for it. Everyone seems to go for politics, literature, or socio-economic issues. As far as I know, I'm the only one in my department who wants to do linguistics; there's a doctoral student in Old Church Slavonic, but she's expected to defend her thesis in December, and her mentor is the same professor who introduced me to the subject and who wants to supervise me as well (I've emailed him about my interest and we've also talked in person, but only once). But there's something about him that bothers me. I had already heard rumors that he was very casual and negligent in supervising students, and when I asked the OCS doctoral student about it, she confirmed that she had gone through a whole procedure to change her mentor to a professor from a different department because he was so ill-informed, discouraging, and generally uninterested. But since her subject (OCS) and mine (linguistics) are so different, I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt. But also because of this, I feel like there's no one I can ask for general advice from. I don't want to be the person who, by showing interest, asking for help finding literature and learning concepts, makes him feel obliged and anxious, and I'm not sure if I should even do this. When I talked to him in person, he seemed very kind and happy about my interest. But I've also heard that if he doesn't find a new student to supervise after the OCS doctoral student finishes, the whole department could be shut down because of a lack of interest on the part of the students and the fact that the university doesn't want to squander its resources. This makes me think that he's only trying to lure me in to save his own skin. I know it's not a good idea to be influenced by people I might have to work with. But this is a major life decision that will also affect my mental health and probably even my future career (even though I'm well aware that it's very difficult to make a career out of historical linguistics), so I really need to have a good mentor. Besides that, he doesn't seem to care at all that I'm a complete novice; I don't know how to judge, but doesn't a man of fifty seriously think that I can gain a lifetime's worth of knowledge in six months? Or am I overreacting and exaggerating? I started reading Beekes and when I got to the end of the book I ordered Fortson's book, which I found in the book recommendations section of this subreddit. Is this a good start? Thanks for reading, and I would really appreciate your (realistic) opinion, advice, or point of view on my situation. Also, if you have any specific recommendations for me, I'd appreciate that too.
The noticing hypothesis arose from Professor Schmidt’s own reflections while learning Portuguese.
Not really. Similar phonology No, it’s just a common Chinese influence. For the main question. It is not entirely unlikely, and some have expressed the view that it is possible, but the problem is that the number of cognates is very small. Even if Koreanic and Japaneseic are related, the separation is so long ago that there is very little evidence to be seen. In addition, we have a very small number of early texts from Korea, and the texts are written in the character, which makes it difficult to know the phonological form. If you want to read something, you can try the works of John Whitman, Marshall J. Unger, and Alexander Francis-Ratte. If you want to know the counter-argument, I recommend the works of Alexander Vovin, which are available for free. As a counterargument to the common grammar, it is usually said that grammar can be borrowed between languages. The relationship between the Japaneseic and the Koreanic is approximately three thousand years old. Since the Yayoi era (currently estimated to be around 87 BC), Japanese has been borrowing writing from Korea. The early Yamato had close relations with the kingdom of the Baekje, and it is said that the population of the south of the river was a mixture of Japanese and Japanese, and that the Japaneseic population slowly became a mixture of Japanese. So the language contact has been seen.
This is not an absolute rule, as some have claimed, but a natural tendency, due to acoustical reasons. The association of lip rounding with the back vowels is a natural consequence of the lower harmonics of the back vowels. The rounding and protrusion of the lips lowers the resonant frequency of the vocal tract, adding to the lowering effect of the lowering action of the back tongue. An unrounded back vowel is therefore less clearly distinguishable from the other vowels than a rounded one. Another similar tendency, mentioned in the article, is that the high vowels will also be more frequently rounded, because it is easier to round the lips when the jaws are closer together.
No. PIE is only the most recent stage that we can trace through current scientific knowledge. It is very likely, although difficult to confirm, that PIE had sister languages that, like modern Indo-European, could be traced back to a proto-language, and that those sister languages also had sisters languages, etc. Everyone cannot know when homo sapiens began to speak. Some argue that the Neanderthals could have spoken.
Icelandic. Icelandic is known for having few loanwords, but rather coining new terms based on existing native words. I don't know about Hungarian, but Finnish does have a lot of loanwords from Latin and Greek roots, especially scientific ones, although still less than many other European languages.
Probably more productive to go to forums for specific ethnic groups in the US. Most of the examples of Welsh and Irish being used in America will be in church services. There is a recent dictionary of alleged Irish loanwords in American English, which is a bit relevant. I don’t have the name or author but it was published within the last fifteen years by an Irish-American professor in New York who is not a linguist. It is a fascinating collection of possible Irish loanwords, but there are a few clearly unsupported ones. The author claims that English borrowed cross from Irish, which is a historical impossibility, because the word comes from Latin and entered Germanic and Celtic as a Christian term, and Ireland was Christianized later than Britain. Ireland was evangelized by Saint Patrick, who was Welsh.
an alternative possibility: It's a way of performatively showing that you're consciously avoiding // and, instead, using a more coordinated, highly controlled pronunciation that's a tad less smooth, so it's totally unnatural. Would like to see if there's any other evidence for this. Edit: Some supporting evidence: “Hark the herald angels sing. The new king has born our world. And man shall live no more to die, by Christmas-day he shall die. ” e as // in angels, o as // in forever, a as // (again?) in Christmas. I'm bad at IPA vowels, so corrections welcome.
*The* is a word that behaves similarly, at least most of the time, inasmuch as individual identifiability is an important part of its use. It’s somewhat different, however, in that they depends on not knowing the referent well enough to have the information needed for he or she, while the only requirement for the referent is to be known, without regard to whatever else is known about the referent. Other words with similar functions are “a certain” or “some (or other)” or the formal use of the generic “one”. Again, not exactly the same, but still connected to questions of identifiability. I don’t think they’s use for “individually identifiable but with partial identity information” is so terribly odd in such company, especially as there’s no other decent alternative.
I would have said Swedish influence, but then I don’t know why Swedish changed   to , but not y to ü.
You don't recognize it as a different type of finger in your language? Do you not differentiate the thumb from the other fingers in your language? It seems a little odd because a thumb is not a normal finger.
No, it’s not quite the same thing as saying no to “Do you mind?” but I know what you mean. I have no answer for you, but it might be worth looking up the German word “doch.”
The question cannot be answered if you do not know a) the kind of work performed b) the location where you live c) whether you will receive additional benefits d) the currency in question.
Wh-words are actually not spelled with an "h" at all. The Old English word "why" was *hwy*, which came from *hw * in the early Germanic *hwaw*, and the Old English word for "what" *hwt* was pronounced with an "h." I think it was only in a spelling reform that *hw * became *wh *. This is not an exclusively Irish thing; not all Irish people preserve the "h," and many British and American dialects also do.
'I believe that 4 and 5 are almost indistinguishable, because once the airflow stops the vibration of the vocal folds stops too. Of course, one might argue that there is a very short, 'infinitesimal' (see 'IntoTheCommonestAsh's reply) gap between 4 and 5, so fast that we don't even register it. So I would say that [t] lasts from '5 to 7'. '4 to 7' is (again, thanks to the same redditor) the inclusive duration. However, what is fascinating about IPA is that it gives the impression of a perfectly serialised set of units, each of which'starts' and 'ends'. In reality, all these articulatory actions overlap. (In 2, the closing of [t] begins while [a] is still open.) Coarticulation makes it very difficult to separate the different elements without the kind of abstractions and'simplifications' offered by IPA. However, if one looks at a graphic score that plots the articulatory movements against time, one can see the overlap.
Yes. The conventional description of PIE bh dh h is that they were pronounced like the velar plosives that survive today in many of the languages of India.
The way you're using it suggests a dialect of English, possibly an African-American dialect. It has nothing to do with education or intelligence. It's just another way of speaking English.
A professor of mine was studying Kartveli phonology; he is from Québec, but he learned Russian to study the language because there is a lot of material on Georgian that has never been translated into English or French. If you know Russian, then you might try searching in Russian.
They are both voiceless fricatives, whose sound source is a jet of air passing over some part of the tongue, which is forming a constriction with the upper articulators. That sounds like a homework question!
For one thing, no. There is no /th/ in Russian. Russians who speak English as a second language find it difficult to learn this and pronounce it more like a /s/ at first.
The core idea is not difficult to understand. I think it’s the fact that ergative is used in many different senses—like the case ending, the semantic structure, the syntactic structure—without making it explicit that it’s the same word being used for different senses. Also, the fact that I don’t speak a language where ergative is the case, so I can’t have a direct example, and that whenever ergative is mentioned it’s immediately followed by special jargon like “agent,” “antipassive,” “syntactic” and other jargon I’m not used to seeing.
I would have thought that the pidgins of the Pacific, Tok Pisin, Bislama and Pijin, have a source of evolution in the native languages of Melanesia.
Very interesting! Thank you for sharing :)
I'm most interested in analyzing how languages change over time, but I only seem to be interested in the Sinitic language for now. I'm also interested in cross-language effects, but I don't have the time and energy to explore it now, such as the spread of Balkan [18] in Balkan.
What might be worth noting, though it doesn't really touch your question, is that "soccer" comes from association football, just as "rugger" (archaic) comes from "rugby football" from the English schoolboy slang. It's still in use in English-speaking countries where other types of football compete with soccer (even in the UK to some extent). What I'm trying to say is that it's not an example of the idea in question.
Yes. This is common for me with the Romance languages, especially. Often I can overhear and half understand the language without knowing what it is.
Catalan is not a dialect but a language. The same applies to Galician.
Those with a puff of air at the lips, like y, o, a, i, e, but instead of using tongue height, tongue backness, and lip rounding, which you’ve probably already realized, is just an approximation. A better approximation (but still an approximation) is that vowel quality is determined by the first three formants: F1, F2, and F3. In general, F1 is higher the lower the tongue, F2 is higher the farther forward the tongue, and all three are higher the less rounded the lips. Thus the rounding of the lips can compensate for opening and dropping the jaw and F1 is essentially unchanged.
There is much that has come down from the Norse into the English from the early Vikings; but, even before, they both belonged to the same tribe of West-Germanic peoples.
The beginning of the acceptance of the Indo-European language family as we know it was Sir William Jones' speech to the Royal Asiatic Society in 1786. Sir William Jones, a British civil servant, who had studied Sanskrit in India, noticed that there were so many similarities between Sanskrit and Greek and Latin that he thought they must all be related.
The Diachronica doesn't contain any examples of k  n, but there are some examples of k   in some dialects, so I would not exclude the possibility of such a change over time. And there are also examples of   k in some dialects, so it's not impossible that this change could take place: k   n.
My own opinion is that, with the explosion of the Internet, there is a steady supply of stupid forwards and memes on Whatsapp, making claims like “Sanskrit is the oldest language in the world”, “Sanskrit is the mother of all languages”, and my personal favourite, “Sanskrit is the best language for coding”. There is also the fact that, for centuries, the British were the rulers of the country, and many people have a sense of inferiority towards them. There is also the fact that Sanskrit was under British rule for a long time.
Derivation is the process of making new words out of existing roots, it can be almost instantaneous. Descendants are merely later forms of the original word; they necessarily come into existence by time, which distinguishes them from derivations. Hound is a descendant of hund; hounds is a derivation from it (by adding the plural suffix -s to the root hund). PIE had a very extensive system of derivation using roots and affixes. Some of these derived words later fossilized into roots themselves, which makes descendants from derivations.
“One thousand twenty three” is an American thing, and it sounds really awkward to me. British people always say “one thousand and twenty three”. The latter option, “ten twenty three,” is far more common with years, I think, and perhaps with money, like 10 twenty-three. In Welsh, this doesn’t happen because its vigesimal system is too limited. When it comes to expressing years in Welsh, the only option is to separate each digit out, like un naw wyth saith, which is literally “one nine eight seven.”
I don't think it has. It has diverged greatly in the last few centuries. The reason we can converse “without any issues” is because people from all the locations were exposed to, and assimilated the standard English. That standard English is not as different from another as, for example, the English from the midwest of the US and that from the north of England. But I would say that divergence has been slowed by exposure to standard English through the media, education, and interaction as respighi points out.
We cannot help you if you do not specify the information you are looking for.
English, maybe. People call everything a bee, casually. Look at reddit.com/bees, how many people post pictures of wasps and hornets, asking what type of bee they are. They’re not really similar. Generally speaking, people are careful observers of nature. Since the beginning of time, they’ve lived with bees and honey. It’s quite possible that they noticed that wasps and bees aren’t similar, and they made separate words for them.
The IPA is capable of writing intonation, which is a big part of what makes a question sound different from a statement. Edit: I thought that in all languages intonation was used as a (sometimes redundant, sometimes exclusive) way to mark questions, but apparently not. Sorry for the confusion!
Similar to ''Dig'' in the United States, but less "Nasty" and more "Brash" or "Irascible" than its American equivalent. It does not come from any particular region of Britain. For similar questions, you can try / r / AskUK.
All of the misconceptions you have mentioned have been voiced by speakers of Semitic languages who aren’t too involved in Semitic linguistics. All of them are wrong, and we semiticians (Westerners and native speakers of Semitic languages like me, but I’m not a semitician yet) dislike them and I’ll try to correct them, one by one. How would a native speaker of one or more Semitic languages who has studied the grammar of his language explain to someone the way vowels work in his language? All Semitic languages are consonant-based languages. They have consonant roots on a mainly vowel stem. This stem, however, has a great deal of meaning and a good way to understand Semitic languages. For example, in West Semitic languages, the stem aC1b2c3 represents the perfective aspect of the present tense for the simple verb. But if you put any consonants in this stem, the meaning changes if you change the vowel and your verb becomes an intensive or passive or a participle. As I mentioned earlier, in Hebrew the verb sh-m-r is a verb meaning “to guard.” For example, shamar “he guarded,” shumar “was guarded,” shimer “he guarded” or shomer “guard.” So here is the meaning that the vowels carry. But both the consonants and vowels are necessary to determine the meaning. The role of vowels in encoding meaning is less important in Semitic languages than in IE languages. There are many minimal pairs in IE languages and in all Semitic languages. For example, in Hebrew there are sefer “book,” safar “he counted,” sofer “author,” siper “he spoke,” sapar “barber,” sipur “story,” and super “supermarket.” There are no less minimal pairs in Semitic languages than in IE languages. Semitic languages don’t have real vowels, but instead approximants. Each of these approximants is a variation of a consonant, rather than a vowel. The approximants are a, e, o, etc. —In Arabic, some dialects have up to ten short vowels (let alone long ones). And some non-Semitic languages also have three short vowels, like the ones in Proto-Semitic. So why do we claim that Semitic languages don’t have real vowels? The concept of vowels was not yet developed in the minds of the Phoenicians when they developed their writing system. The idea was introduced into Semitic languages by non-Semitic speakers who adopted the Phoenician writing system for their languages. But when the consonant n was combined with a long vowel a (due to other phonological developments that removed the glottal stop and lengthened vowels in certain positions), the first two letters n and j were used to write u and i, respectively. It was a natural internal development of Semitic writing systems without outside influence. By the way, not all Semitic languages have an abjad and the first written Semitic language, Akkadian, wrote out all the vowels. And the system of roots and stems in Semitic languages, like in all North Afroasiatic languages, is not specific to Semitic.
I'm a Spanish speaker. From the Wikitionary I see that the -ar ending of par and perar comes from *yih1r-, *yoh1r. This is the case, and in Spanish the cognate is hora, taken from Greek by the Romans, and in English it is "year" (native Germanic) and "hour" (through Latin and French). The word for day I'm not sure of, but if it is related to the Persian di- (as in diruz, yesterday, and diab, last night), it comes from *dhihyehs, and in this way it is related to the Spanish ayer and English yesterday.
I believe it is a matter of personal taste. Personally, I would not say that the sound // is a phoneme in English. It is probably different for different speakers.
Latin of the classical period has lots of them, some of them quite long, and some even nested in others. These are particularly difficult because they are not punctuated. And there was a poetical convention that placed the verb at the end of the sentence. It’s possible to get through a whole page of parenthetical asides before you find out what the sentence is about.
There's a good idea. I speak English well, but I'm not English at all. Somebody has to get the name of human languages straightened out.
That is, it's actually very common in probably all languages. It happens all the time, stops are not always pronounced as stops in daily speech, fricatives and approximants are very common. We can observe that in American English, for example, as the research by Warner and Tucker (2011) shows, it was found by Barry and Andreeva (2001) for six languages, and I am currently finding this for Spanish. Look up phonetic reduction if you want to know more. Journal of the International Phonetic Association, 31: 51-66. See also: The variability of stops and flaps in spontaneous and deliberate speech. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 130(3), 1606-1617.
The fact of the matter is that there need not be any reason for a feature to remain. Just as in the evolution of species, there are vestigial organs, so it is with languages.
I found a really interesting book called “That’s Not What I Meant!” by Deborah Tannen really interesting. I had to read it for a class and I found it fascinating. I don’t know if it’s exactly what you’re looking for but it’s an interesting sociolinguistics topic.
Irish makes the same distinction between “tá” and “is.” “Tá Liam ina mhinteoir” would indicate that Liam is temporarily a teacher, but “Is minteoir é Liam” would suggest that a teacher is a permanent part of Liam’s nature.
A linguist is a person who studies languages in a scientific way. I was first a translator and then a linguist. I wouldn’t have called myself a linguist in the old days.
I love that man. The evolution of language is my favourite linguistic subject.
In southern Appalachia. The word is pronounced borri. He lent me his shotgun—he borri’d me ze shotgun. The Spanish verb prestar means both to lend and to borrow (“take something from someone”). The German verb leihen means to borrow, while ausleihen means to lend.
Why not? They both get the job done.
It seems to me that you are mixing up two distinct subjects and identifying them as having a single common source, if you will. The first subject is lexical compositionality, that is to say, the extent to which the morphemes in a word are perceived as parts of the larger whole. The second subject is whether a given writing system is pictographic, that is, whether it reflects the physical (real world) appearance of the concepts, persons, etc., that it designates.
I would go by example. There is a word for not feeling pleasure, and that’s anhedonic. So your word would be anhomocodic. (Wonderful, two people with the same tax code!)
(Layman) In Tagalog, the verb changes form depending on whether it is a deliberate or an accidental action. What is this phenomenon called? Even after a minute of Googling I couldn't find a description. For example: ***Nasunog*** yung dokumento. ***Sinunog*** yung dokumento. This document has been burned. *** What is this phenomenon called and what languages have it?
I’m not sure it’s the “typical” American pronunciation. It’s more like a Philly or a Jersey accent.
The Dutch Meertens Institute has an etymological register for all Dutch names (and first names). They say that Jeijsman is a variant of Ijsman. Iesman is a variant of Ijsman. Unfortunately they do not give the meaning. ([https://www.cbg-familieamen.nl/nfb/detail_naam.php?gba_naam=Jeijsman&nfd_naam=Jeijsman 'I'&info=analyse+en+verklaring&operator=eq&taal=])
I'm asking myself whether other people have noticed this, or is it just me. Unfortunately, a lot of people still haven't got over the idea that linguistics only deals with the structure of language, and not with the actual utterance of it. On another point, though: do you think it makes sense to regard sociolinguistsics as a peripheral, marginal part of linguistics? Why or why not? Definitely not. Language is a social action, it is part of culture; if we want to take the "core" of linguistics away from the social and cultural context of language, then we must surely have abandoned the whole point of trying to understand language. Not only is sociolinguistsics a core part of linguistics, it ought to be a core part of all the other linguistic disciplines. It is also a practical mistake to do so. I don't know if you've heard this saying before, but there's another idea of "contrary" and "contrary" which is (was?) (I think I hear it most often from older people) used as a kind of euphemism for core and non-core. And I've heard that in some departments (not the ones I've been to, I hasten to add) there is a tendency for linguists to divide themselves into "contrary" and "contrary", and the two groups behave rather badly towards each other. I think this is a disgusting habit. Also, the attitude that sociolinguistsics is not so "core" as other branches leads to the departments hiring fewer sociolinguists than the other branches, and this has a number of dire consequences. For example, sociolinguists are usually the ones who are best at explaining linguistics to people who aren't just language learners and conlangers. In my experience, sociolinguistsics classes are more attractive to students than other linguistics classes, because they are closer to the student's own lives. Finally, the work of sociolinguists is often more immediately applicable to social issues and can have more positive social consequences. So the attitude that sociolinguistsics is less important than other branches of linguistics is not only a narrow-minded attitude, but it is one that reduces the actual social influence of the linguistics departments.
There are many sub-specialties in linguistics. You sound as if you were talking about syntax. You could try searching for “syntax” and the language you want to study. Also I like Langfocus on YouTube for learning examples of grammatical constructions and their history. I like John McWhorter’s books about linguistics, but they’re more of an overview than a textbook.
[On the intelligibility of fast synthesized speech for individuals with early-onset blindness] is a related topic. It deals with synthesised speech in particular.
In my experience (as a second-language learner of French, probably somewhere around the C1 level), present-day French keeps schwas in specific contexts, but not necessarily in "careful" speech. For example, in the French version of the nursery rhyme "Frère Jacques"—which I learned by rote in English and in French as a child, without realizing until I learned French as an adult—the name of the title character is divided into four syllables. The rhyme wouldn't work without it, but of course, most people wouldn't classify a nursery rhyme as "careful" speech. What you will find in more carefully spoken French is an increased tendency to elide syllables. Some elision in French is obligatory, but many others are optional and only used in careful speech. schwas do block elision, and they will come out in careful speech; but in my experience, it would be unusual to pronounce them outside of a few specific contexts.
The influence of other languages can result in changes in syllable structure, but the change can also occur spontaneously within languages. It is a natural consequence of the way sounds are changed that some languages end with more vowels and others with more consonants. Taking English for example, many words which once ended with a vowel no longer do so because the schwas were lost at the end of words. Hence the ‘silent e’ in words like ‘time’ and ‘hate’. Many varieties of modern English have lost the r and l from the end of words like ‘fare’ and ‘bowl’, resulting in words like ‘dock’ and ‘counsel’ ending in a vowel. The varieties of American English that we have to deal with take it a stage further and eliminate various other consonants such as ‘t’, ‘d’ and ‘n’. You don’t have to change from ending with a vowel to ending with a consonant, because other changes are possible: ‘kazo’ could turn into ‘kaz’ or ‘kao’, and ‘kazog’ could turn into ‘kazo’ or ‘kaoz’. In the course of time the relative frequency of vowels and consonants will shift.
No one is right all the time. We all have some misunderstandings; it’s not a matter of linguistics, but of human nature. A part of learning to learn is knowing how to deal with sources that aren’t fully reliable, corroborate what you can.
But I’m wondering, what’s the reason for wanting to expose your child to every possible sound? For the third language, I would probably say Arabic. There is no doubt that there is another language that is even more different from both Chinese and English, but I think Arabic is a useful language and will add some diversity to your child’s... resume?
First of all, not all Paraguayans speak Guaran. But even if they did, it is unlikely that they could understand most of the place names in Brazil that derive from Ancient Tupi. * There is a phylogenetic relationship between the two languages, but modern Guaran is a completely different language. *It is important to note, however, that most of the toponyms we recognize as coming from Tupi today were merely made up by non-Indians during the nineteenth century. The intention was to "valorize the indigenous heritage" to a certain extent, and to favor Tupi as a real language for the nation, instead of Portuguese. * A very romantic idea.
It seems to be so. I eat: the verb  is the root, affixes are  (imperfect) and  (first person). By changing the prefix  for  (subjunctive), the verb remains the same; it only becomes plural. There is no fusion of affixes, as in most of the indo-European languages. I don't say it's a lot agglutinative, but there is agglutination.
“I see,” said the blind man in the ear of the deaf man. The lame man jumped for joy. When I was a child this was a popular reaction to senseless information.
In classical Arabic the letter now called Sin was pronounced like the letter Sin in Hebrew, and Sin as Shin. The old Hebrew Sin and Shin are the same thing, before Sin merged with Shin; the Aramaic alphabet also had those values. The classic Arabic language had no s sound; this is why  was not an Arabic letter. The closest it had to the modern s sound was the emphatic Sin, before the sound shift of the Middle Ages, which turned Sin into Sin, and Sin into Shin. When Greek and old Semitic languages transliterate each other, the unaspirated sounds are always rendered with the emphatic consonants, and the aspirated with the simple ones. Hence the emphatic Sin in falastin.
It’s a regular occurrence, and it’s not particularly surprising. The truth is, there’s no particular reason to expect that any phoneme will stick around forever, especially one as lightly loaded as //.
The problem is that one relatively short text does not have the same word density as a large sample of English texts. Zipf's law is a statistical law, which requires a larger sample (millions of words, the article on linguistics contains only 9000 words). In other words, it is not advisable to put words into order by their frequency in a sentence, for example, "I have a car. " All words here are different and have the same frequency (1). The sample is too small.
Wiktionary (or Wikipedia) depends on the sources it uses and cites. For some languages, Wiktionary uses some well-known etymological dictionaries as sources, and tends to be very detailed, with some oppositions, etc.
I think it's because of the continuity of Galician with Portuguese. In Galician, vós is still the second person plural and verb conjugation in some places resembles that of Portuguese.
The Index Diachronica may be helpful.
I'm looking for a grammar of a Tibeto-Burman language that was posted here on reddit, three or four years ago. I hope someone recognizes it, before I start sifting through hundreds of grammars. What I remember is that the inflection on the verb was mostly or entirely separate from the verb, on its own word, phonologically independent, but otherwise containing only inflectional material, like they were syntactically dependent but phonologically independent clitics or like a construction using an auxiliary verb where the auxiliary verb has vanished, leaving only a cluster of inflections without the base. There was also something noteworthy about the classification system, which I believe was prefixed to most nouns and more detailed than a typical gender system, but I can't remember it. I can only remember what I read here, and my favorite thing about the grammar was that it used verbs with “ee” as a stem, such as “dom” or “keyilan”:
Good luck with that.

forgive and sin are also Germanic.
Italian has distinctive consonant length (there are geminate consonants in medial position, and there is also a syntactic double in the initial position), but it does not have distinctive vowel length.
It’s hard to say, you’d have to make sure they hear you right. I’ve noticed a lot of British people think rhotic means ‘long a’ and deny they pronounce rh in words.
The relation of grapheme to phoneme is not a peculiarity of the languages, it is a peculiarity of the writing systems. In fact, it is useful to separate the structure of the language from the structure of the writing system. The language can exist without the writing system, but the writing system needs a language to exist. The writing systems are essentially an invention. Therefore, I am not sure if there are languages without what you call ‘irregularities’. There are lexical borrowings, for example, or idiosyncratic features, or paradigmatic infelicities, or syntactic ambiguities, and so on.
The use of "mama" and "papa" for children is very common in the Arab world as well.
Imma is not a slang at all, it’s just a contraction of “I’m gonna”, which is a contraction of “I’m going to”. The eastern languages never had the need for such a contraction, because they didn’t need five syllables to express that concept. But they do have informal contractions like sobie - sa or trzeba - trza.
British people save more money on salt by not salting their food. This is a way of flaunting that wealth in speech.
Proto-Germanic is not a very feasible option. You will find many sources for Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse, which are well documented and have many resources for learners. They are more attested than proto-Germanic, which has no usable attestation (we have only reconstructions, and you will not find any practical resources to learn it). I would go with Old English or Old Norse.
Indefinitely, no problem. In formal writing there are, however, conventions about how long a sentence should be.
Deosil or'sunwise', and widdershins or 'opposite of that' were the English equivalents of 'clockwise' and 'counter-clockwise'.
I can’t pronounce it. If you want the IPA, which I recommend, it should be: knöks mn. I admit I’m ignorant of XSAMPA. Other phonetic systems are arbitrary.
the language is learned in the first instance by seeing objects, and having a native point to them and name them.
I've always been interested in this, since it's the opposite for us Spanish-speakers when we speak English. It often happens to me that a word that ends in e (elefantei, grandei) ends up as ei (e.g., tacous, Mexicou).

What’s the point in trying to talk properly, and not like a freak?
it was never dropped in Ireland, where it is commonly used informally as a plural pronoun. e.g. "How are ye?" pronounced as a long "i" (e.g. as in "ask")... Sometimes even with the corresponding possessive: "I don't want to go to my house, let's go to ye're house...". Not sure if this is the same "ye" that OP cites, or a later innovation. There are several other languages which have been called out for that particular deficiency. "Ya'll" fills that gap in American English.
In Japanese, for 'ancient' Chinese (by which is meant before the Revolution of 1911) Chinese people, they are generally transliterated as follows:  (Confucius, Chinese: Kongzi, year of birth: 551 BC) –>  (Gongya),  (Zhu Xi, year of birth: 1130 AD),  (Juhui),  (Isuseong), and  (Liu Xiucheng, year of birth: 1823) –  (Isuseong) – * (Huai Lingyan, who resigned the constitution, and whose real name is only in that case, “si”), (Huai Lingyan) * (Tzuyu, Chinese: Ziyu, year of birth: 1998) – (Juhui), and (Jayu) – (Jayu) – * (Jackie Chan, Chinese: Cheng Long, year of birth: 1954) – (Seongryong) – (Gongya) – (Chow Yunfat, Chinese: Zhou Runfa, year of birth: 1955) – (Seongryong) – (not infrequently, Ziyu) – * (Chiang Kaishek, Chinese: Jiang Jieshi, year of birth: 1883), * (Janggaeseok) * (and * (Chiang Kaishek, Chinese: Jiang Jieshi, year of birth: 1883) – (Janggaeseok) * (Chiang Kaishek, Chinese: Jiang Jieshi, year of birth: 1887) – (Janggaeseok) (Chinese: Zhou Enlai, year of birth: 1902) –> (Sino-Korean: * * * * * * * *)
I know Swedish and think it means "Looking down on Horsens and the inlet." Lid is an old word for slope, hill, etc. This is the only part I'm not sure of, but it's the best guess I can come up with. Sigt = view. Over is the right preposition in this context where English would use "at." Horsens is a city in Denmark. Og = or. Fjorden = the inlet. Horsens has a rather big inlet. To my knowledge, "og" is used in Danish and Norwegian, so I would guess it is Danish archaic. P.S. I don't think that the gene-tests are accurate enough to distinguish between such closely related populations as Germanic-Dutch and Germanic-German. I wouldn't expect high glossary results.
It depends on the name. Some sound fine, altered slightly (e.g. John, which is masculine and ends in a consonant). (I will give John a meal. (John is in the dative.) Names with unusual endings are not altered at all (e.g. Henry, which ends in i). We even have a special category of foreign loan words that don’t change their form according to the case: coffee, kangaroo, taxi, subway.
I think the best example is the genitive's in English. It can be put anywhere, even at the end of relative clauses. So it's a morphologically independent word. But phonologically it's just a part of whatever it's on.
The History of English Podcast is great if you're interested in the history of English. It's a long series of lectures, and the host begins with Proto-Indo-European. He's currently on episode 154, and he's just gotten to the point where he's moving from Old English to Middle English, so it's pretty thorough and covers a lot of history.
The opinion of linguists is that Valenciano is the southern dialect of the Catalan-Valencian dialect continuum. Valenciano is very similar to other Catalan dialects, especially the ones spoken in western Catalonia. It is probable that during the Reconquista Catalan migrated south, as Muslim lands were conquered by the Crown of Aragon and some of them were settled by Catalan-speaking Christian subjects. This is how other dialects were spread throughout the Iberian Peninsula: Galician-Portuguese and Leonese in the west, Castilian in the center, and Aragonese and Catalan in the east.
I think that names that mean “beautiful” are quite common. Linda, Bella, Belle, Jameela, etc.
you’re an American so learn whatever interests you. If everyone learned their spiritual ancestral tongue, we would all speak PIE. Whatever language was spoken 2,000 years ago is not tangibly connected to your genealogy or your ancestry. Do as you will. But what a strange question to ask.
It is a form of the California Vowel Shift. A similar thing happens in Canada with the Canadian Vowel Shift, which is a variation on the theme.
Essentially, there is no concept of “ancestral language” in the original question. How would you define it?
No. In the first place, I wouldn’t say Arabic varieties are different languages. Mutual intelligibility exists on a spectrum, that’s for sure, but it is not at all difficult to quickly learn a new dialect. I am a Tunisian and I can understand all Arabic dialects from western Algeria to eastern Syria. I might stumble over a few words in Moroccan, Iraqi and Yemeni Arabic, but I can understand them pretty well. In my opinion, we Arabs exaggerate our differences too much. Getting back to the question, I don’t think it’s necessary to standardize dialects in the Arab world. Modern Standard Arabic is not a native language for anyone, and so it functions as a unifying language. Everybody has to make an effort to learn it, irrespective of their native dialect. Imagine if each country was to standardize its own dialect, which variety would it choose? In Tunisia, for example, the dialect spoken in the capital would probably be adopted as the official dialect. And so people born in Tunis would grow up speaking the offical language, while I, a mixed southern and Sahelian Tunisian, would have to learn a new official dialect. And why would that solve anything for me? Fortunately, the native speakers of Modern Standard Arabic are long gone and no one would try to force it on anyone as a native language. But why shouldn’t Arab states try to force their central dialects, which are more widely spoken, on their people as a native language in the name of centralization? What you are implying in your question is that each country has one dialect, but each country actually has dozens of them. For example, eastern Syria has a dialect that is closer to Iraqi than to Syrian. Some parts of the Maghreb are almost the same dialect, northern Jordan and southern Syria have the same dialect, in the coastal area of Syria the Sunni and the Alawi speak different varieties of the coast dialect, while the Christian coastal dwellers speak a completely different dialect, closer to the one spoken in Damascus. For all these reasons, I think that the official language in all Arab countries and in all Arabic-speaking societies is Modern Standard Arabic, and I fully support the status quo.

I don’t think many of us are taught it unless we take a linguistics course or a class where we’re taught to do an accent, like ESL or maybe even an acting class.
This is a question that can be solved at www.wiktionary.org. There it is said that cipolla and cebolla come from the Latin cpulla, which is the diminutive of cpa, which is an unknown word and possibly a loanword from a language of unknown origin. And it could be related to the ancient Greek  (Kápia), the Albanian qep and the Welsh cenhinen.
As I understand it, the shape of the letters corresponds to the shape of the thing that makes the sound. So, even though the letter “e” is used to represent two different sounds, the shape of the mouth that pronounces it is essentially the same, and therefore it is also a faithful shape.

But this judgment is a social judgment, and different people have different judgments about what is 'correct' or 'incorrect.' Closest equivalent is'socially constructed.' But that is more sociological than linguistic, to my thinking. 'History' is also one without an English equivalent. It means that a language has existed over many generations, and has undergone changes on all levels (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, etc.). Words are created and lost. This ties into the notion of 'Rivalry': the changes do not occur consciously by the individuals using the language, but are made gradually and naturally throughout the history of the language. 'Rivalry' means 'Arbitrariness of language' on its own. We do not normally say that language is arbitrary. We say that the signs or forms of language are arbitrary, but that is really the same as saying 'Arbitrariness of the sign' rather than 'Arbitrariness of language.' It means that words are pronounced in a certain way, and this way does not necessarily correspond to the way things are in reality. There is no logical explanation for the fact that the English word for 'cat' is 'kitten' and the Korean word for 'cat' is'meow'; the way these words are pronounced has no connection to the concept of 'kitten.' I hope that answers your question. * * * *
As I remember the conversation, Bilbo was trying to get Gandalf to leave without being too openly hostile, so he just kept saying “Good morning” with different implications (e.g., “Good morning,” but implying “Goodbye”). It was that lack of cooperation that Gandalf was trying to point out.
It doesn't make much sense to ask what the vowels of Middle Chinese (let's call it early Middle Chinese, i.e., "early Middle Chinese") are, because Middle Chinese is usually reconstructed based on finals (finals in Chinese are called yunming), so it depends on the skill of the linguist. For example, Edwin Pullen's reconstruction of  is one of the strangest ones that you've seen, because he is a master of the theory of CV phonology. Pullen and the others use a lot of numbers to explain each other. So we have to compare different systems. This article on the Chinese Wikipedia is not the most useful, because it only presents the systems of Karlgren, Li Rong, Pullen, Zheng Zhanfang, and Baxter (I don't know who this Abraham Chan is, and his reconstruction is ugly), but if you don't know Chinese, it's a good place to start.
What do you mean by signs and understanding? Both are very versatile words.
But by saying “if they identify as deer,” you’re not a very honest interlocutor.
I have no idea what you’re talking about, but this seems like bait to me. When you claim “king” and “queen” and “chill” it’s not in “any context”—it’s in the vernacular. This post smells like a dog whistle.
a very rare sound in Indo-European languages is the initial. There is some evidence that n in a few words was assimilated to v. So rare that there is no symbol for this sound in any of the major alphabets that is not derived from some other letter.
As an avid fan of Stormlight Archive, I’d say yes, though it does depend on the context of the question. So, for example, Navani hears Dalinar speaking in the early chapters of the Oathbringer, and she writes down the sounds of his speech. If I recall correctly—and please correct me if I’m wrong—she either doesn’t say what script she wrote them in, or it says she wrote them in female script. If it’s female script, which is the only one that we know Navani can use, then what would have happened is that she used female script letters that are usually used for Alethi sounds to instead write down the sounds of Dawnchant. Since Dawnchant is thousands of years old, and perhaps not related to Alethi at all, the sounds might be entirely different. In that case, a lot of the sound differences might get lost when Navani transcribed it. We have no reason to suspect that Navani has had phonological or linguistic training. So when you say “it seems very unlikely that she would be able to identify exactly what words were being spoken”—by words, do you mean sounds or meanings? If sounds, then Navani would probably be able to identify most of the differences pretty well, even if the language is thousands of years old. But no, she wouldn’t know what the words meant as she wrote them down. Female script is phonetic—you write down sounds. Male script is written to convey meaning. It would be much harder to write down a foreign language in male script than female script. So if your question is, would they be close to translating the whole language before Dalinar tells her what he was saying, then the answer is no. But if you’re asking whether they would be able to translate the language after they’ve matched the Dawnchant sounds with their meanings, then yes, they would know a lot of the language, given how much time he spent speaking Dawnchant and being recorded. So the answer is possibly yes, but let me know if I’m misunderstanding what you’re asking.

In my experience, no. My parents, who come from different countries (Ecuador and Germany), have lived in the U.S. for more than 20 years and still speak perfectly good Spanish and German.
There are a number of petty arguments, or battles, if you like, both between the functionalists and the generatives. I believe the more important battle is the belief that a large part of sociolinguistics is mere apologetic work or community service without much intellectual merit.

This is Balkan nonsense. This is an exaggerated version of the fact that Old Church Slavonic and Church Slavonic are based on the Slavic language spoken in the eastern Balkans (sometimes called Old Bulgarian). There is no Slavic language that derives from OCS/OCS, but the languages of the Slavic population of the Orthodox Churches are abundantly enriched by loanwords from OCS, sometimes replacing the native equivalents, the most affected of which is probably Russian. Orthodox Christianity came north from Greece, and he passed through Bulgaria, so he brought a lot of OCS vocabulary to eastern and southern Slavs, but hundreds of years before, Slavic languages spread out from their cradle in the eastern Ukraine and spread in all directions before the turkic Bulghars came to the area of Bulgaria and amalgamated with local Slavs, losing their native language. Is Bulgarian and Proto-Slavic intelligible? Not significantly more than any other Slavic language. This Bulgarian is mixing up Proto-Slavonic with Church Slavonic.
It’s about the association of social class and lexicon, the imposition of [latin/romance grammar on a germanic language like English?]

I’m working on a degree in linguistics! I’m enjoying it a lot, and I love this subreddit because I can see interesting discussions on topics that I don’t cover in my studies:D
These are not entirely separate phonemes, since they don't change the word into something else when attached to the end. They are more like paralinguistic modifications of words.
The International Phonetic Alphabet was established in order to give a representation of all possible sounds in the human language. There are many details which are not in harmony with it, but if you want to know how a word sounds, that is the only true scientific basis. The reason some words are difficult to translate is that certain ideas can be expressed by a single word in one language and need a whole book to express them in others. For example, Tao, a Chinese religious and philosophical concept that has been the subject of study for centuries, cannot be translated into English as “the way.” Even such a simple word as “family” may mean quite different things in different languages and cultures. What is a family for you? Your direct family, your tribe, your clan? What does it really mean for you?

The two main systems for British English are the conventions used by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Oxford uses  while Cambridge uses e. In this table you can see the differences between the two conventions:
But the 17th century was a long time in English history. English in 1601 was different from English in 1700. But since you say "Shakespeare's time" and Shakespeare died in 1616, it makes it a bit narrower. Most of the early 17th-century sources are still very conservative, retaining the Middle English palatal-velar (or uvular) fricatives. Examples are William Owen's (1605) "Key to the Spanish Tongue", and the two-volume Gil Logonomia (1619, 1620). There are a few East Anglian sources, suggesting that the loss of the fricatives came from East Anglia. One example is the schoolmaster Coote of Suffolk, who wrote in his English Schoolmaster, published in 1596, that "the gh in written words is but lightly pronounced by most people", and that in written final syllables "some counties make the sound of the gh pronounced distinctly, and in others not at all". He also writes that "Daughter" without the gh is "the barbarous speech of your common people". All information in Dobson, English Pronunciation 1500-1700, p. 985–8.
There are two kinds of verbs in English. I don't know whether there are three in other languages, but there isn't any that I know of.
There's really not much difference. There are some areas, for example, where there are non-Russian populations (such as Daghestan), but these people don't speak Russian but rather another language. But if you're talking about Moscow and Vladivostok, no, it's pretty much the same Russian, without much variation. I've lived in Voronezh, close to the Ukrainian border, and served in the army on the island of Kunashir, close to Japan, and there were no communication problems, even though we were a dozen or so different nationalities all in one building.
Basically, any commentary on the Bible is an analysis of both the original language (mostly Greek or Hebrew, but sometimes Aramaic) and the philosophy behind the translation. So you would have to be more precise about your religious goals. Maybe you could find a subreddit that reflects your religious beliefs and post this question there:
Arabic has influenced Spanish, for example.
What is the question? You have successfully broken up ninasoo into morphemes. One (the base) denotes the reading and the others (the affixes) denote the number and the tense.
There are many ways languages develop novel phonemes. To give you an idea, one of the most common is when allophones of a sound lose their conditioning environment, and the allophonic variation becomes a phonemic distinction. Here's a good example. The proto-Germanic language had two words for mouse, mus and musi. Later, in Old English, the /u/ in the plural was elided to /i/, giving mu:s and my:si. Then, the plural ending was lost, giving mu:s and my:si. At this point we have a new vowel phoneme represented by the minimal pair.
I’m not sure. But it’s possible to imagine a sleeping cat as a real, living cat, or as some sort of teddy bear shaped like a cat. “My son always brings his sleeping cat into bed with him.” * This interpretation may be a bit far-fetched, but it’s the only one I can see for the sentence, “He takes his sleeping cat to bed with him every night.” However, in my example, “a sleeping cat” is a compound, but I assume that the sleeping cat in the original post is a noun plus an adjective?
[1] No, I don’t think so. The phenomenon of language attrition is a recognized phenomenon, but it is not necessarily a linear or inevitable one. First, in today’s world, having no access to your native language at all is only theoretically possible. In fact, it would be difficult to go to a foreign country and *not* encounter your native language.
Generally speaking, linguistics is a descriptive science, which does not seek to give a prescription. It does not concern itself with telling people how to use language, but only with observing how people actually use it. So, to answer your question, no, linguists will not have “solved” it. Anyway, what would be their basis for deciding the matter? English does not have any regulating body. The nearest solution you could get is by consulting dictionaries, but even in dictionaries, the words are generally pronounced as people say them, not as the lexicographers themselves would pronounce them. So I would just like to give you my own experience: I have heard “char” very often, “car” only rarely, and “care” never. I know that in some American English dialects, “carry” is pronounced the same as “Kerry” and “Carey” (both words rhyme with “fairy”), but in my English dialect, the word would start with “char” but end with “are”. So, in my experience, the most common pronunciation is “char”.
Among the English accents, this varies a little, but it is not rare for the final /z/ to be uttered as a completely voiceless [s]. The way it differs from a normal s is that the preceding sonorants are usually a little longer. For example: falls [fzfs]  false [fs]. There may also be some distinction in the strength of the final s (the one in false is longer, more breathy, higher), but the length of the sonorants seems to be the main difference. Notice that it is a very nice fact that only sonorants in English can be followed by z or s. The rest (the stops, essentially) can only be followed by one or the other, and so the ending is gs or ks is not permitted.
It’s all Greek to me! The word “language family” is a broad term that refers to any group of languages that have a common ancestor. Some families can also contain other families. There is no precise distinction between a “family” and a “dialect,” as they are both just different names for the same thing. The distinction between “primitive” and “evolved” languages is also very vague. One term that may be helpful is “primitive language family,” which is sometimes used to refer to language families like the Indo-European family, which has no close relatives.
Icelandic. I don’t have personal experience of the language, but I understand that it has changed very little from Old Norse, partly due to geography, partly to intentional cultural preservation. I have been told that the Poetic Edda, written around the year 1200-1300, is quite comprehensible to modern Icelandic speakers, if a little oddly phrased.
Does anyone know if and how X-bar syntax explains the alignments of Austronesian languages? It seems to me that if it does, a case could be made for the order of dp-np-tkp. The 'ang' and 'ng' of Tagalog sentences, for example, seem more relevant to the comprehension of the whole than determiners in English, but I'm a layman, hardly versed in these matters.
All the non-rhotic cities in England used to have rhotic accents, so there was no special expectation that their accents would turn rhotic; the social forces that spread non-rhoticity were also able to suppress rhoticity, and they were already in the ascendant—non-rhoticity was vogue. In general, it would seem that when it comes to choosing between a new and an old feature, new accents would prefer the new feature. * I have no particular evidence for this, however. One of the important things sociolinguists know is that innovations often travel from one city to another, so it would be quite natural for Liverpool to adopt non-rhoticity.
You can search the subreddit. This question comes up every week or so. The unfortunate answer is that most linguists think there might be a small effect on cognition, but not many people believe that language has a large effect on cognition.
It is unethical to experiment on people in such a manner. I believe that such experiments have been conducted on birds, but I could not give you a reference.
I believe there is a Judeo-Persian language that is currently spoken. Here’s one example of a source:
To start with the ‘adjacency’ part: The mapping from tree to string is usually called ‘linearization’, invented by Richard Kayne in The Antisymmetry of Syntax (for a more readable introduction, see the relevant parts of Understanding Minimalism); the basic idea is that a (semi-)semantic relation on a tree maps onto a sequence relation on a string. There is of course nothing to prevent you from linearizing each treelet in a different way, but that isn’t important. Remember that empty strings are allowed in tree structure. It is perfectly possible that a movement might produce an empty string in the place where the V was originally located, and that the resulting string is not adjacent to the V in its new phonological context. In my view, you do not need constituency tests to establish that V and O are constituents in the syntax. In any case, the tree structure fits the lambda calculus nicely, and that is good enough. (In any case, the notion of a constituent is an internal notion of the theory.) If you really insist on doing constituency tests, ellipsis may be easier than movement. Movement seems to produce a free-standing effect in VSO-OSV languages (I’m not sure about this; I’m not very familiar with VSO-OSV languages).
The sz in mismo signifies that the sound is a s that changes towards the end into a s. This happens when a speaker does not time the change of sound from voiceless to voiced with the change of sound from s to m; there is an “anticipatory” voicing of the s at the end of the m. The   I think means voiced h, or h “airy.”
They were closer to Bulgarian/Macedonian. Old Church Slavonic was based on the Old Bulgarian language spoken around Thessaloniki, and Middle Bulgarian was the principal language of the Second Bulgarian Empire, which ruled over much of the present-day Greek lands.

I’m strongly reminded of Iyarica, the speech of the Rastafari, which is familiar to any listener of Jamaican music. This is slang. Like all slang, its purpose is to separate in-group from out-group—what is cynically called “virtue signaling.” In the in-group, its use fosters loyalty, intimacy, and group consciousness, while out-group members are made to feel excluded and bewildered. Slang is especially common in groups that require strong bonds of solidarity and a certain degree of secrecy and separation from the surrounding world: gangs, new religious movements, fraternal orders, and professional guilds often have their own. Freemasonry has an enormously extensive glossary of secret terms. They are based on a re-working of the old guild speech of medieval stonemasons; the KKK uses ridiculously coined words that start with K. (They call their treasurer Klad.) Yeah.

I don't think there's a general term for it, but I think there is for it in Arabic. It's the same in some other languages.
I think it's normal and predictable. Vowels are a little fuzzy around the abstract point, and this space overlaps a little. When someone speaks a vowel in an overlapping area, listeners interpret the environment, and it is assumed which phoneme they were trying to use. The assumption is made by asking which of the possible phonemes I heard. If the word in the environment makes sense, the assumption is made that it was the phoneme. These inferences are so automatic that it takes special circumstances to recognize that a given ambiguous vowel is ambiguous. I'm not a phonetician, but the chart you made looks like a chart I've seen before. I don't think it's so bad that you overlap like that.
Opaque orthography or deep orthography is a better search term. For example, if you search for this title: Predictore di riettura in urdo [Predictore di riettura d'urdo: ha des deep ortografia? ] [doi: 10.1002/dys.1474]

There is some of the vulgar Greek left, mainly in dramatic texts. The Attic comedies, for instance, use a more ordinary language than the speeches in the law courts.

I think you’re describing what sociolinguists call a lexical style.
Yes, yes, yes. There are already some pretty good automatic cognate-detection systems with a high level of accuracy (as high as 90 per cent), and there is ongoing work on the automatic reconstruction of language families. Here is a good recent review:
Those who speak English decide. The dictionaries can decide to include them or not, but no one decides for sure whether they are or aren’t a word. And yes, it’s a word, “paucity,” even though you don’t use it.
((according to Chomsky himself)): "Chomsky presents the Minimalist Program as a program, not a theory, according to Imre Lakatos' distinction. " [source: en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalist_Program] I think that's the way it's done now, because it's the most recent development of his work.
It is common in the Indian languages, such as Hindustani, to end a sentence with "Once" or "Once in a while." So one can say, "Koshish karo, Ek Baar," which translates roughly to "Try it once." Hindustani is an Indo-European language, but the same thing happens in my native tongues, Tamil and Kannada, which are both Dravidian languages. So one can say, "Oru Vaati" in Tamil or "Ondu Sala" in Kannada.

A single contact between two languages or a group of languages can easily cause the one or the other language to change. It happens all the time. This is what causes linguistic areas, where several languages from different families have similar typological profiles due to centuries of contact.

It’s probably because it’s kind of complicated to explain why you should say “I” in one place and “me” in another, but a superficial difference is enough. This is where the absence of cases (overt) becomes a problem: it looks arbitrary from the outside. Explaining the difference every time it arises is a pain, and makes you sound like a teacher. So most people just ignore it when someone uses the “wrong” word, because the sentence is still comprehensible, so why bother. It’s strange for us who speak a case-marked language, because we can see the difference between the two words more easily, but I expect it will be accepted as correct usage in the near future—languages change.
I think it was a joke. In the English-language Wikipedia and various legal dictionaries, the v is said to be for the preposition against.
A language may have a stress-timed rhythm, in which the stressed syllables are longer than the rest, or a rhythm-timed one, in which each syllable should have an equal duration. For instance, when an Arabic (syllable-timed) speaker talks English (stress-timed), if the latter is not very good at English yet, he may do this. The stress-timedness of a language is not acquired by every L2 speaker, though some of them may acquire it.
I am not sure whether this analysis makes sense, because removing the article does not make it vocative, but simply no articles with nouns in the vocative case, that is, not only with names. Catalan has an antivocative article in normal use, and it is also used in colloquial Spanish and Portuguese. I believe I have seen it in Italian and French, but I could be wrong.
It depends on whether you use the model with two tubes, or a resonance tube. The second tube nomogram in this document shows the relationship between the position of resonance and the length of the back tube for the vowel ee. The placement of each formant depends on where the constriction occurs, and on the vowel. This figure shows how the formants relate to the “perturbation theory”. The curves on the midline show the speed of the airflow. At the points where the airflow is maximum, there is an antinode. When the tongue creates a constriction at the antinode, the formant is lowered. When the constriction is at the node, the formant is raised. If you mean that you’re trying to infer them from the tube models or perturbation theory, then it’s best to learn the formants from memory, since it’s difficult to figure them out by ear without some kind of model, since the number of variables and concepts is too high. But there is a somewhat intuitive relationship where high F1 is low and high F2 is front. You can also consider the closeness of F1 and F2 as an indication of backness. A low F3 often indicates some kind of rhotic sound, and sometimes the fronting of the vowel, though it can be seen from F2. There’s been no clear indication in the literature that F4 has any special relation to articulatory segments. It’s often not reported.
But it's hard to help you without knowing what you already know. Have you seen the "complementizers"? They would probably be used for subordinating conjunctions, which would end up in the "specifier" of the sentence, like in the examples here and here. For coordination, there are different ways to represent it, e.g. a flat tree with [[X and Y]] or a tree with more branches. If you are doing this for a course, you should ask your teacher how to represent these things, otherwise there is no right or wrong answer.
Yes. This is called the ox-whistle merger.2
Yes, I would say all of your suggestions. I think that continuous slurring comes from a deficit of certain motor movements and/or a slurred or slowed production of the articulators. It can be temporary, induced by one's own actions, such as a drunken state, or permanent (such as the one caused by disease). We cannot say: "slurring is characterized by X, Y, and Z," because motor deficits manifest themselves differently in different people. I would call it "unpredictable articulation." However, I am a speech therapist and not a linguist, so I would like to hear other views.
Leaving aside the fact that the PIE peoples were almost certainly not literate, and if they were, they didn’t use any living script, almost nothing would be intelligible. At most, a few very basic words such as “father” or “moon” or something like that might have some meaning to a listener, but they would still only be able to recognize what was being pointed at. That is not the case with any of the Romance languages to this day. English speakers can only guess at the meaning of a few words, which are no longer entirely analogous, since many have lost their original meanings over time. Old English was only spoken a thousand years ago, while Latin, which by then had become very diversified, a mere two thousand years old. Hence, the earliest time at which it could be said that there was something like PIE. Is about four thousand years old, of which half has no written literature. Then again, the other thing to remember is that no one actually spoke PIE. It is a rough (though educated) guess at the most likely ancestor of words, sounds, and structures. Whatever people spoke back then was most likely a long way from any reconstruction, with its own dialects and accents. Edit: There is more IE material older than I thought. I thought everything that old was Afroasiatic, à la Semitic. My bad.
Be careful that you don’t accidentally uphold the stigma of rising intonation. I’m asking myself why you’d want to? But you can measure your pitch with Praat, which might help you see what’s up and what’s down.

I think a word that might be of help to you is receptive bilingualism. This is a rather common experience. There may be any number of reasons why people don’t have the opportunity to practice speaking a language. It’s a skill that can be lost or never developed, apart from understanding it.
I don't really understand your question, but I think that the book The Anthropology of Names and Naming by vom Bruck and Bodenhorn and the Oxford Handbook of Names and Naming would be good places to start.
There can be a habitual-perfective aspect. The English progressive (“was”) is not necessarily habitual, nor is the simple past necessarily perfective. In the sentence, the verb “was watching” is not a definite, defined action. On the contrary, it is stated that it is repeated every weekday after school. If it omitted that, it would indeed be a perfective action, but it is not in this case.
Vulgar is a generative language tool for fantasy writers and role-players. Create unique languages for your race of peoples in a single click! Vulgar simulates the rules, irregularities, and quirks of real languages, from grammar to sounds to vocabulary. The Grammar Editor is primarily a rich text editor that lets you write about your language in plain English. However, it also has a "grammar table" feature that allows you to automatically generate grammatical features (affixes and words) that can be used in the Translator.
No, the essential source is not the 1975 paper by Siebert, “Resurrecting Virginia Algonquian from the Dead: The Reconstructed and Historical Phonology of Powhatan.” He has a few misreadings and some biases in his treatment of some aspects, e.g., palatal r, which was changed in Powhatan to r just like in all other Eastern Algonquian languages. (Though often spelled t, it represents a voiceless flap and is frequently spelled r as well.) It is the only published source on the subject, but it has some errors, and I would be wary of using it for certain purposes.
English phonetics is hard, but French phonetics is easy. Since French was not a requirement for my minor, I took it anyway. Self-study is easy after you’ve mastered the basics, but I’d definitely buy some phonetics books in your native language to get used to the IPA and the like. Learning the IPA and phonetics jargon sparked my interest in linguistics.
[Ramses (r-m-s-w) means 'born of Ramses'.
It is clearly fake, as the trains shown were not in existence in 1818, and on the reverse it is clearly a signature of Edward VII, who did not become king for another 90 years. The font used throughout the document is modern, and the quality of the printing is clearly modern. There is a You Tube video that proves it is a tourist fake, and the owner has been given the proceeds of the bond.
I don't work with Minimalism any more, and this answer is mostly based on a conversation with Kobele, so take this with a grain of salt. A major reason is that Minimalist grammars are very restrictive. For example, they are properly formalized, so it is very difficult to extend them, and a lot of the work on Minimalism is about extension. So this makes Minimalist grammars unappealing to many Minimalists. Another reason is that Minimalist grammars are rather simplified when compared to Minimalism proper, so that many workers don't "recognize" the theory in them. One can do formalizations in many ways, and it's hard to know how to do formalizations in Minimalism. Now as for the new formalization by Collins and Stabler, I don't know.
Is there a German phrase that can be interpreted as "Switzerland is not a lake" in English? The phrase wir suchen dich is translated literally as "we are looking for you", but I have seen the ad in which you are talking about and it's a real laugh. I think that the closer the languages are, the more likely it is that there is such a combination, otherwise comparisons between more than two words are just nonsense. One fun thing in the Czech and Polish language is ukat szuka - you know that SZ = ukat. On Polish sites you often see szukej, which means "search", but in Czech it means "to piss", but as a command. The spelling is different, but it is well known that SZ = ukat.
I’m no expert, but I would think it’s because of the utility of the word, which is the main thing that makes it successful, and it certainly applies to lol and brb. On the other hand, pwned can be classified as a separate sub-category because it’s based on a typo, it’s intentionally misspelled, and that’s all it has going for it. As for rofl, it was a super-lol, and in my experience it was only used sparingly. But I’m not saying that my experience is typical. I would add that “lol,” “brb,” etc., existed long before the texting culture came about, and they were merely carried over. But I assume you’re not implying that the development of texting was responsible for it. And I’d rather not imply that, I suppose.
No, of course. “Core” means “aesthetics.” There’s “nightcore,” “cottagecore,” “glitchcore,” and even “traumacore.” It has been applied to a new trend on Tik Tok—“Americacore.”
You might record a longer message so that there is more to go on. In a speech pathology setting the Caterpillar Passage (https://goo.gl/UhhGtxG) is often used.
I believe there is. The singular is indeterminate, as is the 'few' that is found in the Pacific, in the Americas, and even in other parts of the world. Some Australian languages have a super-plural, to stress the idea of many. Many languages also don't distinguish numbers at all. But I think the closest thing to what you mean is the collective plural, where words like 'plant' (children) and 'coed' (trees) are the 'default' form, as it were, the mass form, with the singulative plentyn (child) and coeden (tree). The first are usually translated as 'plural', but are indeterminate. Incidentally, it's a common enough thing for English to be used in the way you're describing: a law that speaks in general terms of children or trees, for example, can imply one child or one tree, and 'nil' (zero) can be either singular or plural.
Wikipedia’s article on English orthography is helpful for questions like this. The relevant contexts are: – before final r or r+consonant – in most instances of “wa-” – when a word ends with a stress – and of course there are various exceptions that don’t follow such a clear rule.
For the same reason that it is harder to learn ballet as you get older... It is linked to motor function—the movement of the tongue, the position of the glottis, lip action. When you get used to certain movements, it is harder to change.
This is not a linguistic issue, but a cultural issue. Both of you are right.
If you mean theoretical linguistics, then the latter is a pretty wide field, just as the former is. There are those who work on statistical and quantitative analysis, not really related to theoretical linguistics. There are those who are interested in building abstract computational models, which relate to the theoretical linguistics of formalism. In particular, think of automata theory, which is closely related to the elaboration of formal grammars, and hence to the theory of generative grammar. Or think of the model-theoretic formalization of the theory of binding and government (e.g. the recent [prize-winning article by James Rogers A Descriptive Approach to the Computational Nature of the Entire Governing Logic of Meaning and Modality]). These subjects are also counted as computational linguistics, and are quite close to the study of theoretical linguistics.
Sardinian. It’s the first language to stray away from the ‘Latin tree’.
Routledge Press has lots of them. They’ll probably be more academic, but the selection is still worth a look.
Some say that a child’s native language can be any language, but if it is a language with a proper grammar and it is learned by rote, a language is a language.
Truly Wiktionary. The American Merriam-Webster has accurate American pronunciations, but they don't print the IPA. Dictionary.com has IPA, but its pronunciations are weird. It's as if they set the Philadelphia dialect as the default. (The average American pronunciation is /pad/.) A quick check of American English is to look up the word paradise. If it starts with a p-, it's bad. (The p- sound is very regional in the U.S. but common in England.)
Canadian: s:, :, about: :, and General American: :, :, and :, with the stress on the first syllable.
I think you mean lexical semantics. In passive voice, the agent (the doer) is the object and the patient (the subject) is the agent. So, yes, semantically it is a switch. But syntactically it is still SVO.
This is possible in non-rhotic Southern US and in AAVE.
Some of you may be interested in the lives of Gonzalo Guerrero and Gerónimo de Aguilar. These two were some of the first Spanish people to learn the American Indian languages.
The nearest thing I can think of is the Shavian alphabet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavian_alphabet
Do you mean rare among languages, or rare in that particular language (in the sense of being rare in words)? If the latter, my first reaction is that it doesn't: what makes a phoneme more likely to merge is for it to have rare features, not to be rare itself. fe is a rather rare phoneme in English, but it's just the voiced equivalent of /f/ and, as far as I know, has no tendency to merge. On the other hand,  and  are fairly common in English, but they're merging with f and v in many accents—possibly because they're the only dental phonemes in the language (and therefore the rarest).
Let me ask this question, then (I’m an utter amateur): if you do an automatic computer-driven extraction, won’t many of the words come out in a conjugated or inflected form, requiring some kind of normalization?
Unfortunately, the office has been closed. Hello. The blackboard says: Undesirable and subject to dismissal: asking if this is correct; seeking advice on how to speak or write; if you have any questions, please ask via modmail (https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/linguistics & subject=My deleted comment & message=I am writing to you about the following submission: redd.to/linguistics & subject=My deleted comment ; message= Thanks! )
In a certain sense, English does have a V2 system. The verb is in the second position in questions such as 'What is this?' Also, we have 'Neither do I, nor do they, nor do I' and so on. Naturally, the system is not as developed as German and Dutch, but it would be misleading to say that it does not exist at all. Wikipedia has an article on V2 systems. You can find more examples for English there.
It is because abjads and abugidas are writing systems, not languages. A language’s family is no indication of the writing system used. Most Chinese speak Chinese but the Dungans and Hui Muslims use cyrillic, and some also write in Arabic script.
Is there somewhere I can find a list of noun-verb pairs where the final consonant differs in voicing? For example, use (noun) and use (verb), sheath – sheathe, bath – bathe, half – halve, etc.? Is there a special name for such pairs?
That's the slang, but it's a valid slang. And linguists have been shouting for years that slang exists and that it is real, but only in recent years has it started to break through into public consciousness.
I was a linguist with the Army (cryptological linguist, military occupational specialty 35P). A linguist means a bilingual person with a skill to do translations. You work in a monitoring room, translating foreign language intel in real time, or at other times docs and reports. This is what you do with DoD, CIA, NSA, etc. It can be an interesting job, but most of the time it's just boring. My language was Korean, so most of my work was listening to the field exercises of North Korea.
It must be the result of the Germanic invasion of the Romance countries. France was invaded by the Franks, Spain by the Visigoths, Italy by the Lombards. This brought the names of the Germanic tribes into the languages.
Is this implicature?
It didn't survive very long in Italian, but for example, the third person singular pronoun esso is used to refer to an animal or thing. This article goes into more detail:
It is singular in Hebrew and, I am sure, it is plural in Spanish and French. It is an interesting question! It proves that in language there is nothing which is not open to discussion. Does a language have the plural?... Add: I just remembered that while in Hebrew we use the singular for "the 1st and 2nd floors," we use the plural for "in all." That is pretty.
In the standard dialects or their closest relatives, they are not merged.
Almost none. There are a few words which have been suggested as derived from the Mundas, but nothing definite. This is to be expected, since the Mundas probably came to India about the same time as the Aryans, and on the other side of the country. The other Austroasiatic languages are even more remote.
I also wondered why the third person was the only one to have a special treatment. I did some research, and this is my hypothesis, if anyone can correct me, I'm happy to hear it. According to the Wiki, the accusative and dative pronouns of the first and second person were indistinct from each other in Old English. However, I remember seeing a'mec' and a 'hiec' before, which were apparently the accusative forms at some point, at least in the East Anglian dialects. The first link says West Saxon had already merged the accusative and dative pronouns into one dative form, so maybe that's what spread to the third person. The second link says West Saxon later became the basis of standard English after the Norman Conquest, so it could have spread that way. It's funny, though, because the cognates of the first and second person in East Anglian apparently went on to form the modern first and second person pronouns in German and Icelandic, and at least the pronunciation in Danish, which only distinguishes subject and object. However, Dutch is apparently ultimately descended from the Proto-Germanic dative, just like English.
One influential model says they are accessed both ways: See Seidenberg, M. S. (2005). Connectionist models of word reading. Current directions in psychological science, 14(5), 238-42.
Are you talking about orthography, phonetics, or phonemics?
I don’t quite understand your question. Could you elaborate? Are you referring to the relationship between language and ideology? A field like sociolinguistics may be what you’re looking for.
How do you say it? I say'skwirl' because it takes away that annoying extra syllable.
Why shouldn’t isolating languages use compounds?
This is from a French dictionary, the Tresor de la Langue Française. Its third entry should give the different meanings of “Galicia”. At the very bottom, the etymology and its sources. This may be useful:
Because their official names are not written in kanji or hiragana.
I don’t like apostrophes, and I am genuinely apprehensive about Enklish’s apostrophes. Unfortunately, it’s the standard, and I’ve no choice but to use it. But why should I defend the use of apostrophes in a language that will be using them much more often? The case of the first sentence above is much more readable if the word is divided into two parts by the “k”. I’d much rather that we get rid of the characters and use the Arabic script to write Chinese.
It may be a good starting point. I think you would need to be able to read Spanish to be able to find information on Silbo Gomero and Chinantecan.
They're mostly talking about the Mongolian, Uygur and Tibetan languages, but non-Mandarin-speaking Han Chinese are also being harmed. The position of the Yue, Wu, Min and Hakka is pretty bad.
There are data and discussions involving creoles where it doesn’t seem quite correct to say they come from pidgins. They are probably the direct descendants of the parent tongues, which have a more rapid development due to outside influences. This is different from the “classic” idea that pidgins become native to children growing up in them. There’s more about this in this article:
This is an example of how AAVE is not monolithic. I understand the AAVE of Pittsburgh, but this one is almost beyond me.
Probably IPA would have been better than attempts at spelling out words in approximate letter shapes. As I am English, my attempts at spelling out words may not be the same as an American’s.
Do you mean those new-fangled pokemons?
I run - ran - ran.
A good question. A little research in the library data base shows that it was the book "Geschichte der slawischen Sprache und Literatur nach allen Mundarten" [History of the Slavic Language and Literature in All Mnd Types] (1826) by the Slovak scholar Pavel Jozef afárik that might have helped to popularize the German expression (Alt) "Kirchenslawisch"[1] ("Old Church Slavonic"), for instance, where afárik speaks of "Alt-" ("Old-") "Kirchenslawisch". [1] The next year we encounter the use of "church Slavonic" in the introduction to the English translation of the Serbi Poems.
I’m not a neurobiologist, but a psycholinguist, so I’ll stick to the linguistics arguments. First, I’m not aware of any linguists who claim that word meaning is rule-based, at least not in the present day (rule-based arguments tend to be focused more on grammatical and morphological operations). Second, many linguists, myself included, claim that word learning is based on experience, i.e., that a child comes across a series of objects that have been given the label “table,” and the child comes to associate this label with the object. This is a bit of an oversimplification, as it gets much more complicated and difficult at the more abstract levels (words like “thought” or “society,” etc.; see Tomasello’s chapters on this in his book “Constructing a language,” MIT, 2003). As for the specific hypothesis about language, as for your example, I think it’s plausible that “table” would have a number of different meanings (probably not controversial), which would be narrowed by the preceding word “myst” or by the context, etc., and this is where there’s probably some controversy. As u/abottomful has mentioned, there’s an entire branch of linguistics devoted to these issues, the branch of Semantics, which contains a vast amount of material on this topic. I would strongly recommend looking into some of these sources (if you’re not familiar with semantics, then maybe you should get a textbook on semantics. Otherwise, the wikipedia article is not bad either: I’ve written this in a hurry, so if I’ve made anything unclear, please let me know.)
"Jammed" is a word that comes from "Jamb" and should be "Jambed." Citation required.
Who are all these non-specialists you meet every day who ask these questions about generative linguistics?
Dutch, apparently borrowed from English, uses the exact same expression! But it is a slight difference: in Dutch, they throw people in front of the bus.
This Wikipedia article explains the Buddhist (and other) concept of “admirable friendship.”
Because the above answer was a little terse, I felt like illustrating it. Here are the first two sentences from the Dutch Wikipedia page on traffic signs: * Zes naamsentrafiekende kenmerken. (Traffic lights are one of the three kinds of traffic signs that the traffic manager can use to regulate traffic on the road. The other two kinds are traffic lights and road markings.) Translating it into German somewhat literally reveals the resemblances: * Verkehrsschilder sind eine von drei Arten Verkehrszeichen, die die Strassenverwaltung gebrauchen (((inserieren)) kann, um den Verkehr auf der Strasse zu begleiten. Die anderen zwei sind Verkehrsampeln und Strassenmarkierungen. * And, in fact, nearly all the words are cognates. (In German, the Germans prefer the word "Strasse"; Dutch uses "straat"; and although the Germans have the same noun "Strasse" (as we do in Dutch "straat"), the Germans have the word "Weg" (German "Weg") for "path." "Wegbeheerder" is an altogether Dutch word, since beheeren has no cognate in German, and is rendered "verwalten": "Verwalten" means "to manage." And although German has the word "Lichter" (light) for "signal", the Germans also use the word "Ampel" (lamp) for "signal", although German also has the word "Lichter" for "light".) Of course, this is only one example, but the Dutch and German languages are really quite similar. Edit: Fixed as per the comments below. See the comments for the original.
I can pronounce all the other trills.
Mark and Luke are coming home. Mark and Luke! This vocative case would make the difference in emphasis quite clear.
Why does Wiktionary give Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions for certain onomatopoeia in Mandarin? For example, it says xi-li is *seek-li, when I feel the "fry" sound is precisely the openness of the schwa and the [i] in Mandarin that is the most iconic. Is it just my bias because I'm a native Mandarin speaker? Does the sound also exist in other varieties of modern Chinese, especially those with different vowels and tone stop codas? Is this word attested in ancient Chinese texts, where all readers would have pronounced it as the stop tone? Generally speaking, do most of the Mandarin onomatopoeia derive from Middle or Old Chinese, such that reconstructions are justified?
I don't know if you're doing that deliberately. Because some of the phrases are contracted, like "it's," I was wondering if you could focus on one word like "it is."
No, but that sounds like something that Human–Computer Interaction / User–Interface research might be interested in. Here’s a CHI paper on modeling learning of new keyboard layouts.
Non-literal speech, yes.

Are you in the Great Lakes states? I'm from there, and what you explained sounded somewhat familiar, so here are some facts from the en.wikipedia.org article on North American regional phonology, in the section Inland North. The North Central States (or NCS) are distinguished by a chain shift of six vowel phonemes, and it involves:...
The German lyrics roughly translate to: "The winter is wonderful, and I love my cap, but put me in the summer, and I will turn into a puddle. " (I have some difficulty with the singer's accent, so I can't quite get the verb to be "put") This is so that "mutter" rhymes with "pfuitz".
There’s no evidence that the cancellation of words is anything new. It’s a recurring theme in the book “1984,” and has been common practice in radio and TV studios for many years. This is a post about words and a new way of thinking about them, what they represent, euphemism treadmills, derogatory slurs and political correctness. Trying to get to the bottom of what a word is and what banning them serves to achieve.
For the second question, I see that even in my native language, Czech, words are introduced for this meaning often enough. Here are a few examples of many (in quotation marks): hust "solid", pehnan "over the top", zabit "dead", top (from English), rocket, etc.
The development of technology is basically exponential, in part because the more technology you have, the easier it is to develop still more. Technological advances occur every day, they are just released once a year. Electric cars have been something we could make for a long time. But there are still many companies that can’t get a return on the investment. One problem is that the grid is not ready to support the number of cars that the EVs can produce. Also, if everybody went electric, that doesn’t solve the problem of fossil fuels if the power came from coal.
The instruction is compiled into a human-readable, ostensibly logical sequence of instructions, one instruction per line. The instructions may have from zero to two arguments, depending on the instruction. These instruction lines are then translated into machine language by simply finding the corresponding instruction code for each instruction depending on the number and type of arguments. The microprocessor knows which instructions have arguments, how long each argument is, and what each argument means. Then the instruction with its arguments is read in as one instruction.
The short answer is that instead of printing all four letters of the name "John" in the phone book, they print just one letter or one symbol, which is less space.
At the ELI5 level, they are: * The CPUs are specialized in executing instructions. There are a great many different instructions that the CPUs can execute, so they are quite complex, but in general they contain 1-4 central processing units, each surrounded by a few layers of fast memory that queues up small quantities of data and instructions for the central processing units. * The graphic processors are specialized in calculating arithmetic with integers. Because if you take a scene in a game and you try to animate it and walk through it, the arithmetic you need to deform objects (so they look like they're animated from your point of view), calculate where the light is coming from and where the shadows should be, how clothes and hair should be blown by the wind, and so on, all of these are simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) but applied to very large matrices, because in the end your display is a tens of thousands of rows and columns of pixels (color, brightness numbers) that all have to be refreshed at least 60 times per second. So the graphic processing unit is specialized in performing simple arithmetic operations very fast with large matrices of integers. And for that it has some two thousand or so simple arithmetic units, plus the fast memory to feed them data in parallel. * Mining cryptocurrencies requires the same arithmetic with integers (like graphic cards), but not necessarily large matrices of small numbers. So the graphic card is better suited to this than the CPU, but it can be further improved by using graphic cards with special arithmetic units specialized in calculating hash functions (pumping a series of numbers into a specific equation as fast as possible). * ASICs are essentially specialized mining machines that do not contain any of the 'unnecessary' elements such as good graphic performance or a good CPU, but are stuffed with as many of these specialized cards as possible to make them perform the arithmetic as fast as possible and for the least amount of power as possible. If you're familiar with computers and you're asking about the actual differences between the chip architectures, I'm not sure if that can be explained at the ELI5 level, so I apologize.
Sadly, they can't. A player with a 60 kbit/s connection is on a ’90s phone-line connection, and at that speed you can’t do anything on today’s Internet. But under normal conditions, two players on opposite sides of the planet can play the same game at the same time, if the game’s mechanics allow it. When the game is hosted on many different servers located around the globe, they could be linked together. In that case, all you need is enough speed to reach the server nearest you, and the servers will do all the heavy lifting and deliver the data across the planet to other players.
Even at ELI level this is still a bit tricky to explain. But in essence, the functions of the logical circuits can be imitated by the functioning of the transistors, which then imitate the mathematical circuits. Then they can store electrical charge (which is the basic memory), and regulate the flow of electricity. From the basic components one can build up into ever more complicated things. If you want a hands-on way to see this happening, I think NAND is a great tool that can demonstrate it.
[This is a ten-million-song card][1] the micro-SD card's storage capacity. The size and shape of micro-SD cards are industry standards, but the memory capacity is based on the density of the memory circuit. The old card had a low memory capacity because it was difficult or expensive to manufacture a smaller memory circuit. Now, with the development of science and technology, it is much easier and cheaper to manufacture smaller memory circuits., the same size card can store more data.
Your IP is an address assigned to you when you connect to the Internet, so that the servers and so on can know where to send you files or anything like that. It's not a part of the device.
It all depends on the game. Let's take chess as an example. When the bot makes its move in chess, it can have around 100 different moves. It can look at those moves and decide which move will give it a higher score. The score can be calculated by a formula that takes into account, for example, the number of pieces (each piece has a value) and the threat to those pieces. The next step is to increase the artificial intelligence, and it is easy to tune up in two ways. First, it looks further than one move. Instead of looking only at your own move, it also considers what the opponent can do next time and calculates the score. Second, it is also possible to change the calculation of the score. A basic score may be to take as many pieces as possible. A more advanced score may take into account how many pieces it has to lose to take those pieces. And a further advanced score may be to protect your pieces as much as possible so that your opponent does not have an easy takeover. On the other hand, in order to be able to increase and decrease on the fly, you have to have a separate program that looks at the chances of winning, and if it is not good enough, it will raise the difficulty, and if it is too high, it will lower the difficulty. If you want to use something like a rocket in a league, it may not be so clear as a chess board, but you can use it as a metric, for example, "How soon can I get to the ball, "How soon can my team get to the ball, "How soon can my opponent get to the ball, "what team do I have the ball on, and if the ball is in my team's hand, or in the opponent's hand? and then decide on what to do. Moreover, you can change the frequency of checking artificial intelligence. For example, if it is a chess game, it is necessary to make a decision every time. If it is a rocket league, it may be possible to make a decision every five seconds, two seconds, one second, half a second. This may make the shooting less accurate because it will try to shoot while looking at the metric that is a little old.
It is in a simple way, with two sections. First there is a transformer that converts the line voltage from 110/220 to the correct low voltage needed by the notebook, this is written on the label under the battery. It works like this: There are two coils, one with more and one with fewer windings. When the electricity is running through one coil, it generates a magnetic field, which is transferred through the other coil, causing an electric current there. The ratio of windings determines the step-down or step-up ratio. The second part is called a rectifier and converts the alternating current to direct current. This is usually done by a set of four diodes, which are electrically a one-way valve. It is important that these diodes are arranged in such a way that whichever way the alternating current is going at any time (the current alternates 50 times a second), it is always shunted through the same path, so that it becomes direct current. There are other parts such as sensors, smoothing caps for ripples and other irregularities in the power quality, etc. But that is the basic part of every notebook charger, plug pack or whatever.
They were written in machine language. The human programmer would then convert the “program” into a series of instructions to wire the device. In the earliest days, this meant literally inserting wires into the system which changed its wiring.
You're getting the answers to a theoretical question. In practical terms, it's just a question of terminology. And it depends on where you work what you're called. You can have a programmer who does the job of a software engineer, and vice versa. And there are many engineers who program.
The first bits of everything were written in assembly language, according to the architecture of the particular CPU. Then higher-level languages were developed; think of it as a cake, with the instructions that the CPU itself understands at the bottom (assembly language) and everything else on top. This is, of course, very simplified.
Not that it’s so much harder, it’s just that there isn’t much demand from the average home, so it’s not offered much. A home is much more likely to watch four hours of Netflix streaming in a day than it is to up-load four hours of youTube streaming. Picture a highway that’s wide enough for eight lanes of traffic, but that only supports four lanes of traffic. This is the ISP’s Internet connection to your home. It could be set up with four lanes going one way and four lanes coming the other way, but that wouldn’t let them do their min-maxing with numbers, or the advertising “bigger is better.” If they adjust it to six and two, then they can say “Look, guys, we’ve got six lanes going in!” and people buy it because it’s a higher number, so it can support three devices at once or whatever.
Because, as the saying goes, the numbers don’t lie. Data gives us historical data and trends that shape and forecast the future, so that it’s possible to make projections.
It is because they are switch-mode power supplies, that is they convert the power from the wall, i.e. 120/240 volts AC to a voltage between 12 and 20 volts DC. The power brick is full of many electrical components such as resistors, caps, inductors, silicon chips and integrated circuits that cut the power when things get too hot and other similar things. The two main components that make it heavy are the transformer and the heat sink. The transformer converts the input to a lower or a higher voltage and consists of copper wires wound around an iron core, and therefore they can be heavy. The heat sinks are pieces of aluminum that cool down the mosfets. They have good reason to be big, but if you have taken one apart, you will notice that they do everything they can to get it as small as possible.
JPEG-XL is a new image format that uses advances in the field of digital image compression, developed over the last 30 years. It also assumes that computers are 30 years faster, so it's better. But WebP, JPEG2000, JPEG-XR, AVIF, and a whole lot of other formats also tried this and only got some use, despite being better than JPEG in some ways. JPEG-XL looks like it may actually completely replace JPEG (and PNG) on the Web because it does everything perfectly, is standardized, is free, and is widely supported and has some clever features that many other attempts have neglected. Especially that you can take your existing JPEGs and make them smaller for new users, while serving old users, this avoids a lot of chicken-and-egg complications for new formats. There have been a million smart engineers who have tried to make web sites faster, but they have only managed to catch up with other smart engineers who try to make things work more effectively. This is a pretty big advance, but as a general end-user you probably won't notice it, it will just be one of the things that makes the web a bit better than before.
This is a pretty neat way to encode information into a picture. You will notice that all QR codes have the same features, that is, a large nested square in three of the four corners, and a smaller nested square in the remaining corner. These landmarks allow the reader to determine the size and orientation of the QR code. After that, the rest of the QR code is a grid of black and white squares that represent a series of ones and zeros. This is a gross oversimplification of the encoding method, which is very complicated and has a high degree of redundancy. For example, the reader can work with some of the squares hidden by the company logo on the screen. It can be decoded as a web address or an app url.
There is a difference between the two standard forms of USB, A and C. A is the kind of USB one finds on a computer, and it only supports a maximum of 5V, which is suitable for charging a phone with at most 10W, because it needs too much current to do the job through the tiny cables. USB-C supports Power Delivery, which means devices can tell the charger what voltage they need, and if the charger supports it, it will provide it.
- J&amp;J works the same way as flu vaccines: they tame the virus to produce the antigen (a fragment of the spiked-particle). They multiply the tame virus using eggs, because the virus needs living cells to grow. MRNA vaccines are multiplied in a biochemical reaction (in vitro). They only contain the code of the antigen. In a nutshell: J&amp;J gives you a factory to produce the spiked-particle, while MRNA vaccines give you an instruction manual.
Imagine that you have a Word file. It is a perfectly readable document, except that everywhere the word "the" is expected, you see the letter "Z". Now at the top of the Word document you read: "Z = The" So you go and replace every occurrence of the letter Z with the word "the". Now the document is readable again, but it's probably not much bigger than before. This is how gzipping and dezipping work.
it's not about CPU, as in a cpu-based computing device. It's just about playing against a player who's under the control of a machine.
A good analogy is an office, which is very carefully designed, and has features (like desks, water coolers, and staplers) that do very specific things (very specific) and are located very specifically. A program designed for a particular type of computer is like a worker who comes to work *very* precisely, and is accustomed to seeing the features above in their very specific places. If you move even a single thing around, it gets confused and starts screwing up. So the basic thought is, “A console is a small office, but my PC is a much bigger and more powerful office. Can’t the workers just go to my office and work as fast?” Unfortunately, no. It’s big and full of the newest and most powerful office equipment, but none of it is in the right place. The very-detailed workers can’t work because nothing is where it’s supposed to be. There are two choices: 1) Rearrange your office, or 2) Move the workers. The first option is to fire all your old workers and hire new ones who can work in your new office. In this analogy, this is the equivalent of rewriting the programs to run in the new environment. This is a long, expensive, and labor-intensive process, and in the end you have a single program running in your new environment. But the second option is to duplicate your old office in your new office. Then all your old workers know where everything is and they don’t need any retraining. That’s an emulator. But there’s a problem: in most cases, it’s just not very efficient. When you duplicate your old office in your new office, you don’t just rearrange everything to look like your old office. You have to keep everything exactly as it was, because otherwise you confuse your workers. To do this, you have to get some sheet-rock and build a complete imitation of your old office in a corner of your new office, and you have to fill that copy with exactly the same things. And everything your fake office needs from your real office has to be supplied by your real office workers. Does the fake office have a sink and running water? The real workers have to go to their own sink, and scoop out water by hand, in buckets, and dump it in the fake office at a precisely controlled rate, to make the fake office think it has running water. Does the fake office have a clock on the wall that you look at? The real workers have to look at their own clocks, perhaps convert the time to a different time zone, write the time on a card, and hold the card up at the spot where the fake office would normally have a clock, every time someone in the fake office tries to look at the clock. You get the idea. This makes duplicating a whole new type of computer in your old computer very inefficient, because of all the little lags. And even a big and powerful enough computer has a hard time supplying all the services the fake office needs to run at full speed, even if the fake office is small.
how can reddit know the reason for your grandmother to buy a gaming pc?
Docker provides a standardized way of developing, distributing and running software. It is a reliable way of providing interoperability, because the standards are so strict, and "it just works" because you can't do anything that native code can do. A docker image is like a hard drive that has an operating system and applications. When you create a docker image, you start with the installation of an operating system (which is usually done for you so you don't have to do it yourself). Then the applications are installed (which is usually also done for you, for example if you just tell docker that you want a popular package like Java, then it's already installed, you can use it without having to do it yourself). So inside your docker image, it's not so different from what you would have on your hard drive if you had installed it yourself. The containers, where the docker image is running, are so called because they are locked, they cannot access the host operating system or other applications, not even your network or your hard drive unless you give it permission to. And then the container only gets the permission you give it, so you can share a folder with the container and it does not have access to your other folders. This has advantages for both security (a worm that runs in the container cannot escape the container) and for stability (in a traditional environment, software has shared libraries and DLLs, so if something happens to a DLL or library, for example, because it's patched or upgraded, this can break several applications that use it). On the other hand, each docker container is completely separate and has its own DLLs and libraries, so one can do crazy things without affecting the others. A fun feature of docker images is that you can build them as layers. For example, if you have two containers that both run on a Linux base, then they share one Linux and one Java, but these layers are read-only. Each container has its own layer above the read-only layer. So what is in one container is not visible in the other, because each container has its own layer on top of the read-only layers.
The processor (the brain) can only do so many things at the same time because it has limited resources. When the available resources are used up, it can't do any more, so it's prioritizing what it can do and using up its resources as needed. Give it more tasks and it takes longer. If I asked you to make dinner, clean your room, get dressed and brush your teeth, you also have to make choices with the resources you have available.
Because ram is faster, the latency of the data lines between the memory and the CPU is important. So even when the ssd's have moved to a serial bus, the ram still has a high-speed parallel bus. That's why there are so many pins. Every command is sent at the same time, one bit per pin. But this makes the address space limited. If the CPU needs to read from the memory in excess of 512gb, it must use a line that is not available. There are simply not enough pins on the memory. The pins do exist, but the signal does not go to the memory but to the motherboard, which makes sure that only one memory on a channel is activated. That way, with multiple rams, you can have more than 512gb of memory.
real life? or minecraft? in real life steam engines are all essentially the same: the water is heated by some heat source, vapor is formed and the hot gas wants to expand, and either a steam pump or a steam piston does work.
The function keys on the keyboard are used in an Excel Spreadsheet by people who are experts in the field of “Number-Punching.” Number-Punching is one of the most common activities in the field of Spreadsheet. The use of the arrow keys facilitates navigation between nearby cells, while the Home and End keys, plus Page Up and Page Down facilitates navigation between distant cells. If you are in Excel and have activated the ScrollLock key, you can use the arrow keys to move the screen without losing your cell and so you can pan up and down to see any unused columns or rows without losing your ability to type in the cell you are in. This key was created for the sole purpose of facilitating navigation in Spreadsheet. Your next question will be why we need a key for this, because one can clearly use the mouse to scroll and click on the cell one wants. But for a long time, there was no mouse. In the ancient past, most “computers” were terminals, connecting to a mainframe and sharing its resources. In 1969, the program LANPAR was created for mainframes, and Microsoft’s DOS operating system did not support the mouse until 1982. By 1985, it was still rare for people to have a mouse. During this time, we had Spreadsheet in common use, but no mouse.
Minecraft has a thing called Redstone, which can transmit signals over distances. There are a few Redstone components (redstone torches, repeaters, diodes, etc.) that can control these signals in a way that simulates logical combinations like AND, OR, NOT, etc. Since that is all that a PC is based on, you can build redstone circuits that mimic the behavior of real CPUs.
If you think about the way the information is written on older, spinning platter-type hard drives, each bit of data is just a little region of the disk that gets magnetized or demagnetized by the heads. Now think about how the region gets magnetized. It isn’t a constant amount. The heads have only a short time to cause a corresponding induced magnetic field on the platter surface. You can compare it to painting a new drywall wall. The first coat of paint covers about 80 percent of the wall, but there are still a few spots where you can see the color of the drywall showing through. After the second coat, the coverage goes up to about 92 percent, and after the third it goes to 99.997 percent. A “1” gets written at about 80 percent; a “0” gets written at about 5 or 6 percent; a “1” after a “0” gets written at about 75 percent. With proper calibration and the right tools (both hardware and software), you can figure out, for example, what a series of “1s” after a “0” looks like, work backwards, and maybe, with a little luck, figure out what the original file was like. But this kind of forensic work is expensive, and it’s only worthwhile if the evidence at issue is something like a crime scene or the cryptographic keys to your bank account. But if you really have to do this, then you should do random ones and zeroes, not just zeros. It obscures the data with random noise and makes file recovery much, much harder. But if you only do a single pass of 0s, there are still some professional tools that can do a good job with that.
Time spent having fun is never wasted. But, that aside, it depends on the game. Some games test and improve your memory and problem-solving skills, some games test and improve your reflexes. Some games are just plain fun.
You have 100 Legos, in four boxes. Someone asks you for all the red ones. You find the red Legos in all four boxes and deliver them to the one who asked for them. Besides, you might be asked to analyze each piece of Lego and determine its best possible use. Are there 100 of them? Does one box contain more? Which colors are there? Are any of them damaged? Are any of the Legos in such a shape that they cannot be used? Does each piece have the same number of knobs? Etc. Now just change Lego for data. And boxes for data warehouses.
windows and other operating systems are not very particular about keeping ram empty. It doesn’t cost anything to delete whatever is in it, when something else needs it. In windows, the most noticeable example of this is superfetch, where windows temporarily loads frequently used applications into ram. The ram that is used for this is in a peculiar state, it is full of useful data, but also ‘free’, so to speak, in case another program needs it.
often it comes with early access, which, in my opinion, is the main lure of pre-orders.
It take time to draw the animation. It cost money to pay people for their time. More time cost more money. And it take more time to draw quality animation.
context: in the nineties, before the advent of USB, you were either using RS-232 or a proprietary jack to connect your devices. Drivers were not automatically installed, and you had to do everything yourself. USB was not without its problems at first, but it was still an era of great progress. Adapting USB-A to look like a headphone jack would be a big mistake because people would never stop connecting it to the speaker or mic input on their PCs. The smart people at Apple invented Lightning, a reversible plug. USB-C is a universal standard based on this idea.
The mistake here is that you are confusing the factory reset with the format. Deleting a large file just requires deleting the data about this file from the file table, namely, it will be removed from all the records, and the other records are arranged properly, and the records may be very large, but it usually takes only a few seconds. Factory resetting usually means deleting all the files in the machine, leaving the operating system intact, and resetting all the settings, so it will take a little longer. But the format is different from the factory reset, and only formats the file table, does not care where the files are placed, and takes almost no time.
A game engine is a kind of starting kit for the development of games. Most of the game engines contain such things as lighting, physics, some kind of asset manager, etc. that almost all games need. So game makers can spend more time developing the game than on solving the bugs of the development tool. Some engines are available to anyone (Unreal Engine, Unity), others are in-house for a company that has some significance (Rage for Rockstar).
The easy way to upscale an image is to expand every pixel in the image to three or more. However, if you take a diagonal line of pixels and make it larger, it will look like a stairway. A more complicated way to upscale is to detect which lines in the image are lines, so they don’t widen as the image is upscaled, and they remain narrow and clean. It’s the emulator’s upscaler’s little tricks like this that make it more than just a pixel expansion.
Assembly is the instruction language of a CPU. They ‘know’ that one sequence of bits corresponds to one particular operation, they have it hard-wired in. Let’s say that 00000010 means ‘add’, but it doesn’t mean the addition but rather that it expects a sequence of bits that need to be added, for example 00001000 and 0000100. The actual sequence of bits would be like this: 000000100000100000000100. It may not be that easy to read, but the CPU can read it as ‘add 8,4’. Obviously this is a simple example, but it’s really the foundation of it all.
I'll try to explain as best I can and not information dump. @@ ARGs are all very different from each other, but they all share the fact that they take place in the real world, have characters and tell a story. Some ARGs also have players who are not involved in the production, but who find clues. @@ ARGs are made either to promote something or just for fun, to tell a story. The Dark Knight had an ARG for promoting the movie. In an ARG, the creators create the characters, clues and story, while the players discover clues and thereby help the story to develop. It is hard to give a precise explanation of how ARGs work, because there are so many and they all work differently. The ARG for Catastrophe Crow does not work the same way as the ARG for Daisy Brown, but I'll talk about it another time. In general, that's how ARGs work. I hope I have answered your question and made some sense, lol.
IT is a very wide field that includes almost anyone who works on a computer. This includes service engineers, programmers, cyber security experts, and also computer network administrators.
There are billions of switches in a hard disk drive, which are turned on or off to represent the ones and zeros.
cooling. A fridge cooling a computer is much more energy-consuming than a few fans or a water pump. So I doubt that it's cheaper.
The Registry is a part of Windows where many of the settings and registry entries, both for the system and the various programs you have installed, are stored. If you delete a program, it is no longer needed, but it may not be removed from the Registry. Occasionally a program's bug can corrupt a section of the Registry. The resulting pile-up of unused and obsolete data can lead to a sluggish system or visible problems. But in most cases, it can be left alone.
A mechanical watch is powered by a spring. The more the spring winds down, the less the force that drives the watch. So if it were only a simple machine, as the spring went through its rounds, the speed of the watch would slow down as well. This is not what is wanted, and so the mechanism must be made to work at a steady speed whatever the pressure applied to it. A pendulum solves this problem in a clock, but a watch must work in any position. That’s a difficult engineering problem, and it requires a mechanism with a large number of parts.
It depends on the density of the area, and how well you can control the magnetic fields. This is an old video, but it's a good way to learn about the technology. The greater the disk, the more platters you need, but there is a physical and electrical limit to the number of bits that can be stored on each platter.
To cut to the chase, it doesn't make sense to defragment an SSD because it doesn't suffer from the same problems as spinning disks. Data is written to a conventional hard disk drive in concentric circles, from the inside to the outside, like an old phonograph record. When files are changed, they grow, but the area where the file was originally located is often filled up with other files. This is called fragmentation, and it's bad for hard disks because they have to move a physical head back and forth. The more it has to move, the slower the hard disk, so if a file is fragmented, it's making the hard disk move the heads around a lot, for no reason, and defragmenting puts all the pieces together to make them easier to access. On the other hand, there is no moving part on an SSD, and so no matter where on the drive a file is stored, it will always be accessed at the same speed. So defragmenting an SSD is completely pointless. It also doesn't help that each of these SSD cells can only be written to a limited number of times, so defragmenting just makes it wear out sooner without doing anything useful.
x86 is so called because of the initial series of chips from Intel: 8086, 80186, 80286, 80386, 80486... For 80586 Intel ran into the problem of registering a number and therefore Pentium ("Pente" means five, just like pentagon, a five-sided polygon). All the names include 86, so x86. x64 is a contraction of x86-64, which means x86 with 64-bit extensions. A piece of trivia: x86 originated at Intel, but x86-64 came from the camp of AMD and later adopted by Intel. For its part, Intel's 64-bit Itanium was incompatible with the x86, it worked only in the enterprise and was not even very successful. Finally, the Itanium was rejected and the AMD 64-bit architecture was adopted.
But you see them in megabytes per second. Basically, the difference between megabits and megabytes is a small or big “b” (mb or MB). So 800 megabits per second should equal 100 megabytes per second. But... The data is en route, just as you drive from home to the store, where your car can go 160 kph, but you only get 40 kph due to speed limits. And if you are using a Wifi connection, that will also affect the speed a little.
- How the 0s and 1s of a particular file are stored and arranged? How the system knows where the file begins and where it ends? - There is a thing called the "Master File Table" (it's a file system called NTFS, but there is an equivalent of this in all file systems) which is used to keep track of all the files and folders on the drive. It contains information like the starting address of a file, and if it's split into several blocks and where they are. - How a file can be written or increased in size without affecting the adjacent file? - If the new data fits in an existing "allocation unit", then it's just written to the same "allocation unit" and the "Master File Table" keeps track of where the file begins and where it ends. If it doesn't, then it takes the next available unit and records the information about where that unit is in the "Master File Table".
RAM is like information in your brain which is immediately accessible. Disk Usage is like a lookup in your phone or in a book. Let's say you're making a cake and need to look up the recipe. As you read the steps, the recipe is loaded in your brain (RAM). Once you have completed one step, you go back and read the next (Disk Usage) and it's loaded in your brain (RAM).
In most modern game engines, like Unreal or Unity, the animation system is separated from the underlying game mechanics, to facilitate easier division of labor between the programmer and the artist and animator. There’s no one right way, but one common approach is to have an “animation controller” that responds to the player’s actions or certain events in the game, causing the corresponding animation (set up by the programmer and set in the game engine), while the game engine handles the complicated business of rendering and animating the model itself. Many game engines also have the ability to blend certain animations, like walking, jogging, and running, so that a character can appear to move at a more organic pace, even if you don’t want your art team to make a separate animation for every possible speed a character can reach.
: In a 4GHz processor, you're sending 4,000,000,000 (4,000,000,000) electric pulses per second. Each of these pulses can only represent one instruction, and you have to wait for the instruction to come out before sending the next one. Why do you have to wait for each instruction to come out, is that you don't know how long each instruction will take to come out, and what path it will take. If you send the second instruction before the first one is out, you don't know what comes out: it may be the result of the first instruction, followed by the result of the second. Or it may be that the instruction 2 will cross into the instruction 1 and you will get the result of both. And it may also be that you get the result of the second instruction first and the result of the first instruction second. So you don't know what you get until you know the result of both instructions. When you send 4 billion instructions per second, light speed starts to become extremely important, even at a distance that small. The smaller the chip, the faster the instruction will be completed in the chip and the exit will be. The faster the exit of the chip, the faster the instruction can be sent in. The speed will not double if the chip is doubled in size. The speed will be cut in half, because you have to wait twice as long for each instruction. If you halve the chip size, you will double the speed, because you have to wait half as long before sending the next instruction. This is the reason why chip manufacturers talk about the size of the transistors. If you take two identical chips, but one has 7nm transistors and the other has 14nm, the 7nm chip is twice as fast. Intel and AMD have developed a multi-threading technique where they try to anticipate the outcome of each instruction. This could in theory allow them to send a second instruction before the first one has come out. In practice, it doesn't work very well and even in ideal conditions you can only send two instructions at the same time. If you could send an infinite number of instructions at the same time, it would perhaps be possible to make a bigger chip better. But "two" is really the limit for the moment, and it will probably be a long time before we can do better, if ever.
Chess is one of those games that has an almost infinite number of possibilities. At the beginning of the game, each player has twenty possible moves, and so after one move there are already 400 possibilities; after two moves, the number is more than one hundred thousand; and after three, more than one hundred million. I know it looks like the action on the board is slow, but inside the mind of a good player there are dozens of combinations and sequences, and it is a master’s skill to select from among hundreds the one most likely to lead to victory. Now, of course, for the 99.9 percent of people who are not interested in this infinite variety, it would not take long for the game to end. I am a chess fan, but I still lack the depth and patience to sit there and not move for a few minutes.
If you think about it, it’s not hard. In the days before hard drives there were VCRs, tapes, etc. So, any TV show that aired on the air was also recorded on a VCR or tape. In order to show a replay, the TV station would simply select the relevant section of the tape and air it again. However, you may want to know about the time before digital recording, there were reels of film. The show would be filmed in reels of film. And those films would be played. Then there were technicians who specialized in cutting and splicing different film reels. It was a little like the cutting and splicing of today’s digital editing. Namely, when it comes to changing scenes, there was a “cut,” but in the past, this was the actual physical cutting of film reels. But basically replays require recorded images. The media for these images have changed over time from film to tape to CD to hard drive to NVM. I hope I’ve answered your question satisfactorily.
It’s all a matter of expectation. We are all getting spoiled by how good technology has become. The same holds true for everything. If something gets better or if you get used to a certain standard, you get accustomed to that standard and you start to expect that standard every time, and when it doesn’t live up to it you get frustrated. Take a wealthy person who loses almost all of his money and now has to live on $1000 per month. This situation seems wretched and depressing to him because he is accustomed to having more. Take a person who lives in a poor country and has to make do with a dollar a day and then offers him $1000 per month and he thinks this is a wonderful thing.
The answer is that it's very difficult to do that kind of stuff. Source code: Drive the car to the superstore and buy some eggs. Compiled code: Set the throttle to 24%, hold it for 22 seconds, set the steering to 45° for 3 seconds, set the brake to 50%, use feet, walk for 78 paces, reach isle 32, go to shelf 2, position 8, take... It's very difficult for a human to understand these instructions. For example, there's no information about what's in Isle 32, because it's somewhere else in the program and these instructions are no longer human words. So now you need to understand what is in Isle 32, how driving works, how walking, etc., to make these instructions meaningful. For a complex program, this is a very difficult and almost impossible job. And what is the point of decompiling, what do you get from a million lines of code? This is not a secret that can be stolen, this is a program for a game, and most of them will not be used in other games. You can only use them to rob and cheat, and they have already done it. Most of the work in the game is in the assets, in the shapes, textures, sounds, videos, etc., and the actual code is very small. Let's say the code takes 1 minute to write, but it takes 1 hour to decompile. So, for a game that takes 10 people a year or one person 10 years to make, what do I get after spending 600 people years to decompile and see the source code? In this time, I can make 60 games.
Let's say I want to send you a code that contains up to 81 digits from 0 to 9 in total. I'll arrange them in a 10  10 table with the last row and column empty. Then I fill this last row and column with a number that adds up to zero on every row and column. Mod 10 means that it turns around after the tenth digit. So 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8, 8 + 8 = 6, etc. Then let's assume that during the transmission one of the digits got "corrupted." As long as there is only one error, it is possible to determine exactly where the error is and what the number should be. First, you have to sum up every row and column. Then circle every row and column that doesn't add up to zero mod 10 in this way. Only one row and one column are thus circled. The cell where these two lines cross must then be corrupted. If you now put the number that makes this row and column add up to zero, then you have corrected it. The more errors there are, the less likely it is that you can correct it, but it's still easy to cope with one or two errors. The Reed-Solomon method is just a clever way of implementing the same idea with more complicated mathematics, which makes it possible to tolerate a maximum of errors and still be guaranteed to decipher the entire message.
The only time it ever works (it really does, I've seen it), is when a switch is needed. Often, network problems that would be solved by a restart are solved by the Ipconfig /release and Ipconfig /renew commands. I've also seen it work to fix sound problems, for example when a red X appears on the sound icon.
Well, because they are reliable, while new systems may contain errors that are fatal. It takes experience with a system to be sure it will work when you want it to. I work with industrial control systems. Reliability is much more important than performance. So there is great reluctance to change a system that works, even if it offers many new advantages, if you don’t have a track record of ten years running without a hitch. A failed military vehicle is a lot more expensive and might kill people.
Cryptocurrencies require a lot of computing power to work. Instead of building huge data centers, they essentially crowdsource the processing power. How it works depends on the currency, but basically if you are the first to process a certain number of transactions or a certain amount of transactions, you receive a unit of the currency for that time on your equipment and the data connection. Bit mining is just equipment that people buy and use only for executing cryptographic transactions and thereby generating more of this currency.
in the telecommunications sense it's the number of bits that can be transmitted in a certain time. So if an ISP says it offers 300 Mbps of bandwidth, they're basically saying you'll get 300 million bits (300 MB) every second when you access the Internet through them.
Let's start with the simplest example: the two computers are next to each other and are connected to each other with a twisted pair of CAT6 cable. This cable is just a bundle of copper wires. There are many physics problems involved in choosing the design of the cable and shielding, but at first, think about the two computers are directly connected by a pair of copper wires. Send data, just use a certain voltage on the wire to represent one bit, 0 is a negative voltage, and 1 is a positive voltage, and one sets the voltage and the other reads the voltage. The two sides agree on a "clock speed" in advance, and each sends a bit every time the clock is "ticked". The Ethernet protocol is very simple, and there is no turn-taking. The sender broadcasts data to all the other computers at the same time. If it encounters a "collision" when sending, it will stop sending and wait for a random time before trying again. It sounds very simple, but in fact it works very well. When only one computer wants to send data, it can send as fast as possible; if many computers want to send data at the same time, they will take turns and send them one by one. The Ethernet can only send one packet at a time, and one packet contains 1518 bytes, which is one Ethernet packet. When sending data, if there are too many bytes, it will divide it into many packets and send it. There is no secret in packets, but only a series of bits. How to send a meaningful character from the bit sequence is decided by the two sides. These days, the packets are almost all IP packets, and most of them are TCP and UDP, which are the most commonly used transport protocol and a universally accepted protocol for transmitting large amounts of data on the Internet. However, we don't have to use the Internet protocol. In the local network, the two computers can send any bytes, as long as the other side on the same local network knows how to read it. . Finally, there are many ways to connect to other things, such as Wi-Fi, coax, optical fiber, usb, etc., all of which are different ways of physically transmitting bits, and these are not the "interpretation" of the bit.
Your gateway doesn't know. The gateway simply responds to the requests that come to it. If only one thing is happening, all its resources (speed and processing) are dedicated to that thing. If several things are happening, the resources are shared. The sharing means that each process is slower than if it were alone. The more processes running, the longer each will last.
The controller makes a physical change to the memory component. In floppy disks, it was a magnetic change. SD cards and flash drives use a NAND memory chip that traps electrons. If the gate is charged, it changes the resistance. A new, higher voltage is required to release the trapped charge. By using a higher voltage than the initial charge, but less than the new, higher charge, the controller can determine if the gate has been charged or not.
There's no one way to do it, as with anything involving coding. You do whatever you want, especially if you're using C++ and have written your own game engine. There are advantages and disadvantages to every solution, and any advantages are often countered by a disadvantage in the form of "time spent."
@@@ The CPUs are incredibly complex and delicate pieces of electrical equipment. They are not literally made of rocks. No raw or gross stone-crushing or rock-chipping ever occurred during the production. Each part and each layer was very carefully built according to exacting specifications in the scale of tens of nanometers — billions of little switches that work together.
The ARM microprocessors used in cell phones and other devices are much simpler than the x86 microprocessors used in desktops and servers, and as a result they are less capable of running some tasks. This lack of complexity means that they are a little slower in certain situations and have to be coded differently. But with less complexity comes less cost, less heat, less power consumption. Which makes them ideal for use in portable devices like phones.
Imagine you’re reading a long number to a friend. In “raw” mode, you would actually say zero, five, four, two, two, two, three, seven, seven, six, five, etc. But since that would be inefficient, you’d say: zero, five, four, then four twos, three, seven, seven, six, five. Something like that.
Taking the case of your water timer, if we go back thirty years or so, you would find a box full of logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR and flip-flops) or analog circuits, which can be used for very precise operations (for example, if a rain sensor detects rain, turn off the sprinklers). You can do some simple calculations, either with analog or logic. You can save basic settings (such as the time). But you can only do the kind of very specialized tasks a sprinkler timer can do. A computer is much more flexible. You can do any kind of data processing. You can do much more complex things. You can “remember” more information. You can change the behavior and program after you buy the computer by adding new software, which you can’t do with a non-digital gadget. Now, let’s move on to today, and today the so-called “digital” is so cheap and so small that it is now included in almost all electronics. Instead of having to make a complex circuit with dozens of logical devices, it is cheaper to use a tiny digital chip or a digital chip embedded in a larger chip and write software to do the logical operations. This was not always the case, but now it is.
a collection of switches are combined into logic gates. Logic gates are combined into adders, multipliers, etc. We create a list of two-digit binary numbers and map the operations (e.g. the 1s and 0s) to them. We can map the operations to 1s and 0s – 000 add, 001 subtract, 010 multiply, 100 move, etc. We arrange the switches into something called a “memory” that holds a 1 or a 0 if it has a power source. We can combine these into adders, multipliers, memory, etc. – no, I mean much more than that. You create a small device that accepts three numbers: A, B and Operation. It reads the Operation and sends A and/or B to the proper device, based on the list of operations we made. You now have a very basic central processing unit. We combine a bunch of simple cores, specifically made to multiply quickly. You have a graphics processing unit. Set up a huge, fast data stream between the CPU and the graphic card. Add a lot of points in 3D space, then turn them all into a 2D image using linear algebra. We can display this image on a monitor.
A hard drive that moves mechanically is made up of spinning plates made of a material that can be magnetized and demagnetized, and thus can store bits of data as either magnetized or not. A solid-state drive is made up of memory chips made of a special kind of semiconductor memory, where a particular bit is either on or off. Once changed, it stays that way until it changes again. So, when you make a change to a hard drive, you're causing it to change from one state to the other.
Google is your friend. There are so many different detailed guides that it would be pointless to explain here.
It's a little counterintuitive, but that's not how it works. A smaller CPU with a higher density of small components actually runs more efficiently. It has fewer electrical losses, which means less heat. The benefits of high density components are generally so great that the heat dissipation is actually not that bad. And it's not really that hard to dissipate heat from the silicon chip.
There are several reasons, the main one being latency, because of the lag between button presses and displaying images. Besides, regular CRTs introduce some latency which makes it harder to play. Modern emulators have a run-ahead feature that predicts several frames in advance and depending on what the player does, it will display the correct frame. That does help with the lag, but it’s hard to explain how. I prefer playing on a CRT monitor rather than on my PC, because it just feels snappier.
Starcraft 2 came out pretty late, so I suspect the game was still getting bug fixes and major patch updates until 2008-2009. Moreover, Starcraft was still a popular e-sports game even after the release of Starcraft II. The following article on Liquipedia dated from June 21, 2021, suggests that the game will still be supported in 2021.
*A car*s specs can be compared with the ones on a car: speed, traction, horsepower, etc. Each one plays a role in determining what the car can or cannot do. *Ram is very fast memory and used to actually handle the data being worked on at the time. *For instance, the web-browser you*re using to read this thread is loaded into the ram to handle the data of this page. *The common format for modern computers that can be used by normal people is gigabytes, in the range of 2 to 64 gigabytes. *Memory is sometimes used as an alternative name for ram. *The graphic chip / GPU handles, well, the graphic data and presentation. *If you see the red * symbol on reddit,* that*s the graphic chip doing its thing. If you see a picture, a movie, or anything else visible, the graphic chip is the one doing it. In general, graphic chips come in two forms: integrated graphic chips (cheap, but often powerful enough to handle basic graphic needs like web-pages, word-documents, and so on, used in low-spec office-ready computers), and powerful graphic cards (like the Nvida*s* 3080) to handle the demands of advanced 3D programs. *In the world of today, most modern computers have graphic cards, from cheap ones that still perform better than integrated chips to very expensive ones for picture/movie editors that often cost more than the whole machine. *Due to the chip shortage caused by the pandemic and other factors, the high-end graphic cards have become very expensive, in some cases even more than the rest of the machine. *For normal users like you and me, the cards can cost from 100 to 3000 kr. * *Storage memory,* usually coming in the form of hard drives and solid-state drives,* differing in the specifics but both used to store lots of data very cheaply, but with a slow access speed compared to ram. *The common formats of today are gigabytes and terabytes,* one terabyte corresponding to roughly 1000 gigabytes. * The storage memory of modern machines is 500 gigabytes to 4 terabytes. *The central processing unit / CPU is the brain and engine of the whole machine. *Unlike the graphic chip, which handles only the specialized data (like graphic data), the CPU handles almost everything. * Along with the graphic chip, it*s one of the main indicators of what the machine can or cannot do. * The prices are in the range of 50 to 5000 kr. * *Network cards / network connections: they determine the internet connection and tinker with the underlying network - your router, your repeater, and so on. * *Today*s modern machines have both cable and wireless connections. * So to simplify things, when you open your web-browser, you open reddit and write your question. * The web-browser (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, etc.) is a program stored as a data file on the storage memory. When you open it, it*s loaded into the ram and takes up some ram space (too many things open = ram full = problems). * The data is then transmitted to you by the network card / connection, often connected via cable to your router, and from there to the internet via your ISP. * The graphic chip handles the data that actually shows up on your screen, like the red * symbol on the right, the blue area of the rule-bar, and so on. * The CPU handles the actual data being processed. Somewhere a single thread of the CPU*s computation power is busy working on this very sentence. SYL -
The "instructions" are a mystery to us. It is super-chaotic, and the soft- and hardware can't be separated. (Imagine a billion blind people banging on the keyboard a billion times, until one accidentally writes a program that does your taxes.) It would be impossible to then modify the program by hand to do another similar task. Moreover, some of the brain's properties are not compatible with our material. We don't have a material that can change its own hardware while learning. We'd have to simulate that with soft- and hardware. Also, we don't know how to copy the brain's programming. Half of it is very cryptically written into our DNA; the other half is basically shaped by experience. We could try to imitate the brain's experience-shaping, but we couldn't just take the human brain's program, because we don't have access to it. And even if you only care about the hardware, the biochemistry is very, very complicated. We are far from being able to create such a material synthetically, as it is created by our DNA.
ISPs do not store content temporarily, the file is transferred directly between users for the sake of other users. The vast majority of users do not have a service with a known security vulnerability, which can be misused. Firewalls and routers make it very difficult to get access to this service without deliberately configuring it.
FLOPS - floating-point operations per second. Or operations per second in general, instead of looking at the speed of the processor, you look at the amount of work it actually'solves' in a given time. If you are genuinely trying to choose between various different processors, simply check the performance tables, where they put the processors under a standard load (by running a specific program) and record the results as to which is the fastest.
* Even though the hard drive’s free space is increased after a file is deleted, it is simply tagged as “free space”—in other words, the files are not actually deleted. * It’s like removing the labels from the spice rack without taking out the actual spices.
The size of the pins may be an issue if the specifications say so. Otherwise, it depends on the quality and length of the cable, the two devices’ abilities, and the standard’s specifications. For example, if the standard is 10MB/s, that’s the kind of speed the manufacturers are obliged to meet.
There are a lot of different data buses in your computer, each of which uses a different technology since they were designed for different purposes. The most basic data bus is the parallel bus, where every bit in the data, address, and command lines has its own physical wire connecting the parts. One more wire carries the clock signal that tells the reader when it’s time to read. This is very cheap, not just in terms of components but also in terms of timing, so it’s often used in low-latency applications. In addition, it’s useful when you’re connecting several parts in parallel, since you can easily separate the address bits from the data bits physically. The DDR standard for memory busses uses a parallel bus, as did the old PCI bus for connecting expansion cards. But to reduce the number of wires, most busses are serial. This means that there’s only one wire carrying the data and the clock signal. At each clock pulse, the data is sent one bit at a time, and the receiving part has to put together the bits into bytes if it wants to understand the data. There’s also a way to drop the clock wire entirely and let the receiver figure out the clock from the data itself. In that case, you only need two wires—the signal wire and the ground wire. You can achieve pretty high speeds, since you don’t have to synchronize all the different signals over separate wires. So the USB standard and the I2C standard are serial buses.
Basically, it's all math. There are mathematical operations which are easy to verify, once you know the answer, but hard to calculate: factoring a very large product of prime numbers, for example. This is essentially the same idea with encryption: you can turn some plaintext into nonsense by combining it in a specific way with a "key" (e.g. a password). If you don't know the key, it's almost impossible to turn it back into the original text. But if you know the key, it's easy. Which is why keeping the key secret is so important. So you might be reluctant to send the key to anyone. This is why people have also developed ciphers which require two keys: one to turn text into nonsense, and another to turn nonsense into text. With this kind of cipher, you can make the cipher key public, but keep the decipher key secret. It's much easier to keep something secret if you're the only one who knows about it. Of course, if you have the nonsense and you know the cipher, you can try all the possible keys or try to guess the private key using the public key. But there are a lot of possible keys, and predicting the private key is one of those operations that's very hard to do. Even with the fastest computers, it would still take a few years. This is the kind of thing that movie people mean when they say "decryption takes a long time"—though they often exaggerate for dramatic effect.
256 bit encryption means 256 bits of key length. Think of your house key. It may have 4 or 5 ridges. Now imagine your key having 256 ridges, and each ridge can be up or down, and you get a lock which has a key space of 117800000000,000,000,000. It would take a lot of time to guess the key with such a key length.
A pcb is simply a way of connecting components, so instead of connecting them with wires, you fasten them to a pcb that has conductive tracks between them. The pcb can have active components, such as microcontrollers, which can be programmed, but these components are still separate from the pcb.
A kind of glue-gun controlled by a computer. A wire-like device melts a material, which it then rams out of a smaller hole. All the while, the wire-like device moves in different directions, producing shapes. X, Y, Z axes.
There’s something in your operating system called the “scheduler.” It’s a piece of software that coordinates which pieces of software are run when. So it’s a hierarchy, but a relatively flat one. The scheduler is in charge of everything else. And then the programs have different priorities, for instance the mouse on your monitor shouldn’t wait for a slow calculation to finish before moving. So the scheduler makes sure that the programs are ordered by the order in which they have to be run (so that a high priority program can pass its priority on to the process it is waiting for).
It is a process by which one can create a program for a particular purpose. A program is a set of such instructions. It is a combination of several magic spells to make the computer do something. It can be very large and complex. These spells or instructions are created so that people who do not know these special recipes and spells can use the computer. They can put their questions and answers on reddit, search for things on the Internet, play games and watch cats. Edit: - I would have mentioned mobiles here too, but I am old-fashioned.
Such matters are usually done by design teams, assisted of course by digital tools. Usually the design teams consist of a number of specialties—electronics, materials, mechanics, robots, and so on. Of course there is prototyping involved, but I think it is kept to a minimum because of cost considerations. New lines are built if possible by rearranging existing elements, but sometimes new machines have to be designed or existing ones have to be modified.
Since the 50s they have been trying to get the computers to play chess, but they used to be much worse than humans. But the speed and memory of the machines have been getting better and better. Now, because chess is a relatively simple game (you only have so many pieces and you can only be in certain places), it turns out that a well-designed and fast computer can beat a human on this particular problem. In the 80s, the computer “Belle” could already play like a chess master, and in the 90s, the specialized computer “Deep Blue” beat the world champion. Today, a program called “AlphaZero” plays chess with itself for a few days, and in that time it learns to play chess (and a few other games, including Go, which is harder than chess) much better than any human ever could. But the real world is much more complicated than chess — there are many things that are really quite simple for humans, but which a machine can’t do yet.
Originally, it was read directly from the disk. But this had the disadvantage that it could be skipping if it was shaken, or the reader could be temporarily blocked, and then it would skipping. So, in the 90s, there was a "skip protection" which is similar to what you say. It reads the next few seconds of information and stores it so that you don't skip if you go jogging.
Everything that a computer can do, you need to give it instructions to do. Even just to write these letters on the screen, someone has to make an instruction to write the letters. Instructions are called “soft ware”.
Encryption systems rely on a couple of prime numbers, large prime numbers, as the basis of their algorithms. These primes are found by randomly choosing large numbers and checking if they are prime.
Some underestimated the technological development or thought that fax machines had been invented much earlier. The first truly effective fax machine was the Xerox telecopying device, which came on the market around 1966. And by then we had already had (equally effective) a color television for more than a decade. We can date a “printing telegraph” from 1843 as a mere proof of concept. It is true that the printed circuits were hand-made, but there were already printed circuits and even integrated circuits. It took a few more years before the first central processing unit was produced, but fax machines did not even need data compression. They could operate with purely analog technology, i.e., measuring the brightness of the page and converting it to a certain sound frequency, and then reversing the process on the printer. The data compression was added pretty soon to reduce the transmission time.
The reasons are twofold: 1) for a long time, PCs have been standardized. This wasn’t always the case—in the past there was competing hardware like the IBM PC, Commodore, Atari, and Macintosh, and none of them were compatible with each other. 2) An operating system needs drivers to communicate with the hardware. Since a PC is a relatively powerful device, the operating system has the resources to include a wide range of drivers. Due to resource constraints, a mobile os is restricted to only the necessary ones.
It works one of two ways. Either the monitors are all attached to the same computer, in which case it doesn’t matter since the keyboard will only operate on the one program that is in focus. Or the monitors belong to different computers, and the keyboard has a connection or a keyboard shortcut that allows it to switch between them.
Theoretical calculations ignore tiny little things that don't make a difference, but the reality of these sizes is that tiny little things do end up making a difference, and the resulting plot of measured values vs. theoretical calculations is quite different. At a 90nm node, trying to make a 20nm node means fighting thirty different quantum effects at once. You are dealing with light that is too large to make the shapes you need, with quantum tunneling across the gates, and with all kinds of other things. So you can do some lithography improvements from 90 to 65nm, then from 65nm to 45nm you can work on improving the gate oxide to improve the tunneling effect. From 45 to 32nm you can perhaps work on the Extreme Ultraviolet lithography for a little while. Solving a couple of problems at a time makes it possible to keep moving forward. It's often much faster to deal with a sequence of single issues than to try and deal with a group of issues all at once. If your car has no gas, no starter, faulty spark plugs, faulty coils, and faulty air flow sensors, it's going to take a long time to figure out why it won't start, and it's going to take much longer to figure out why if you just solved one of those issues.
Encryption means making a change to a text that makes it unreadable, but which can be reversed again by using a suitable key (password). For a very simple example (which children like to use), take a number and "add" it to each letter of the text you want to encrypt. For example, if the number is 1, every letter A becomes a B, every B becomes a C, etc. If the number is 2, every letter A becomes a C, every C becomes a D, etc. If you have the number three and you want to encrypt the word "hello," then you have: @@H + 3 = K @@E + 3 = H @@@L + 3 = O @@@O + 3 = R The encrypted word is now KHOOR, which you can decrypt again using the same method (K - 3 = H, K - 2 = O, K - 2 = R). Of course, modern encryption is a lot more complicated, and the process is based on complicated mathematical calculations and other unreversible operations. There are several ways to do this: 1. Select a suitable key for encryption.
It seems to me that it uses your graphic card to solve complex math problems and if you get them right, you get a reward.
It all depends on your system board and the skill of the technician. First, let’s take a look at what memory is. Memory is a sort of warehouse, with a whole lot of trays and bins inside, which can be filled up or emptied out to store information. The warehouse can be asked to fill, empty or check a bucket, but this takes time (lag) and you can only begin a new task at certain times (clock speed), plus it takes a certain amount of energy to fill, empty or check a bucket (voltage). So you could design a quicker layout for the buckets, so that you can check each one more quickly. Or you could design a better central controller for the buckets, so that you can get new instructions more quickly. That’s all very well, but what happens when the requests are more than the memory can handle? The instruction might be to check the buckets every ten seconds, but they take you a realistic thirteen seconds. You could work faster, but you might overturn a bucket, or spill water into an adjacent bucket, or report that a bucket is full when it is empty. And if the instructions come too quickly, you might be unable to cope, and shut down. Also, if you don’t have enough energy to check the buckets, this will cause a problem. The memory is exactly the same. You ask it to do more than it can, and you get errors in the data you store, errors in the data you send to the CPU, etc. If you provide too much energy, you might even burn something up. Modern memory automatically tells the controller how fast it can go, how long it takes to process a request, and how much voltage it needs. But every piece of memory in a DDR4 system has to operate at the same voltage, lag and clock speed. If the controller runs everything at the slowest speed, you lose performance. If it runs everything at the fastest speed, the slowest sticks might not be able to keep up. In the worst case, you have one piece of memory which runs at a low speed but a low lag (say a 2400Mhz piece of memory which can be operated at 16 cycles of lag) and a second piece which is high speed but has a very high lag (a 3600Mhz piece of memory which has to be operated at 20 cycles of lag to operate at 2400Mhz). In this case, the controller has to calculate the speed of one stick and the lag of the other – which is possible, but still messy, especially on older boards. If you want to overclock your memory, you have to take care that your two sticks have the same capacity, especially if they are of different makes. One piece of memory might be fine as it is, but it might be unstable when overclocked, whereas another piece might cope well with the extra speed. But these instabilities are not really a big problem. It’s quite common to mix and match different speeds and different makes of memory without sacrificing performance, unless you use the slowest in every slot. That’s the main disadvantage of mixing memory: if you have a hundred-dollar piece in one slot and a three-hundred-dollar piece in another, you’re spending double on memory and getting the same performance as with a single hundred-dollar piece in every slot.
Each byte is represented by a combination of eight 1s or 0s, which allows 255 different possibilities. Each possible combination is assigned to a keystroke.
The SIM card is a unique identifier for your phone. The card itself has a tiny microchip with a unique number that is hard-wired inside, and some information about which provider issued it. There are a billion and a half different IMEIs in the world. The SIM card is what tells the cellular network and the phone, "This phone is connected to this account, on this network, to this provider, and to this phone number." That's why, when you put your SIM card into a new phone, you keep your phone number. The SIM card is the only thing that makes you "you" on the cellular network, the phone is only a container that makes it possible to communicate with the cellular network.
It's the only reason why HD streaming can survive. An hour-long, well-compressed 1080p film may end up at 1 GB, while an uncompressed one might end up at a terabyte.4K is even worse. Uncompressed 4K film is 1.5 GB per second. You don't have the bandwith to stream an uncompressed film. Lossless compression is less common because the ratio of compression is relatively low, but lossy compression is used all the time. A better compression algorithm can give you a smaller file with the same quality or a higher quality at the same size, or a faster decompression speed, which is highly useful for large files.
Clustering is a generic term for a number of machines used for a single or similar purpose. They all need some way to communicate with each other, usually instantaneously, but this is not a hard and fast rule. They can be on the same local network, even on the Internet, or they can be connected but off the network and the data can be transmitted by hand, this is called the sneakernet.
It would. But then all it would tell you is whether it's possible from that one particular starting position. The problem is whether it's possible from every possible starting position. There are an infinite number of those. What's needed is a general proof, one that would hold in all cases, not just for a finite number. Wiki's got a couple of proofs for N=2 and N=3. In a nutshell: Remember that maths doesn't always correspond to reality. Mathematicians often work with any number of dimensions, since maths doesn't need to be limited to the world as we know it.
Wifi 6 is the new brand of wireless technology. You may see that some wireless devices support 802.11ac or 802.11 a,b,g,n, which is pretty clear to the general public, so the WiFi Alliance has renamed the customer-facing ones, such as 802.11ax is now called WiFi 6, and 802.11ac is now called WiFi 5. But it is not the same as 5G or 5G wifi. WiFi has long supported 5GHz connections, but the old people don't have enough data to use it, but over time, the need for speed has increased, and now most of the wireless routers have two networks, a 2.4GHz network and a 5GHz network. Wifi 5 does not support 802.11ac (it has to be ac, but I don't see the meaning of it), and Wifi 6 (assuming all the equipment is Wifi 6) supports the concept of transmitting to multiple devices at the same time.
Here is an analogy: Imagine that you have to store a number on a piece of bread. You store it by toasting some of the slices and not others. Someone asks you to erase the bread. You do this by scraping off the burnt part of the toasted slices. Do you see how easy it would be to recover the data you erased from the bread? That's what hard drives are, but with magnetized rust.
The table is just an adaptation of the memory addresses for human reading convenience. Of course, in the actual memory, they are represented in binary, but most humans have difficulties with conversions, and by simplifying the explanations, the tutors can explain the important parts without having to deal with unnecessary complications.
Whenever people need to store something, they hire a space at a storing company. Cloud storage is the same thing, only you pay for a space on someone else's hard drive.
Unlike video, game graphics are created on the spot. What you see on the screen has to be calculated, drawn, and projected on the screen in a fraction of a second (one-sixtyth, or however fast the animation goes). That’s a short time to do something that requires a lot of work. Better graphics require more work to calculate: more pixels have to be colored, more triangles have to be drawn. A more powerful system has more horsepower than a less powerful system and so it can do the more complicated calculations for better graphics faster.
it's a bit difficult if you don't know much about programming. C++ is a long-established programming language, my sources say it was released in 1985. It's a low-level language, which means that the programmer must think of something closer to the workings of the machine than in a high-level language. In this regard, a similar difference can be imagined between making cookies from scratch and buying a tube of dough, because these two resemble "low level" and "high level" language. Pointers are the name of a type of variable that represents a memory address because, instead of containing a value, they contain a pointer to the value. The difference is that "abc" is the value that can be manipulated, but "abba's apple in box A1" is only a reference to where to find the apple. C++ is famous for allowing programmers to do very smart tricks with pointers, and they are very fast. But when you do something wrong with the pointer, the program can go wrong in a very strange way, and you may not be able to tell what's wrong. C++ macros are a part of the compiler that helps a programmer make duplicated codes by allowing C++ to duplicate the code itself. If there is some tricky way to use the pointers, you can write a macro to do that, and make sure it's not done incorrectly everywhere. "Hello, my name is (your name)" is a type of macro called a greeting. If I wrote something like #GREETING("Alice"), the compiler would replace it with "Hello, my name is Alice. " In the world of programs, eight years ago is a long time. Since then, many new versions of C++ have been released, and each new version has tried to improve the way it handles problems that programmers often make. Especially the pointer-related ones have been added, so that you can use the high speed while avoiding common mistakes. This meme is from the point of view of a programmer who is familiar with the latest C++, and has to maintain a program made in 2008. That's why it's written as "in the year 2008" The programmer must understand the basic relationship between pointers and macros. The recipe book has a lot of ingredients, and the first hundred pages of the book are only ciphers, but the rest of the book uses the ciphers, for example: 1. Put the dry ingredients together. 2. Beat the butter. 3. Pour in the dry ingredients. 4. At a certain temperature, at a certain time, bake. The shorter the cipher is, the more you have to look up what dry ingredients are, what creaming butter is, what mixing means, what a certain temperature is, and what a certain time is. Now imagine that you have to make a mistake in the cipher and correct it. In other words, the programmers who used C++ in the year 2008 were maniacs who ate "Mt. Dew" and "Snack" blended together.
It keeps a copy of itself. You can count the number of ones in a byte—if it is odd, write one, if it is even, write zero. Then you can find every time a bit goes from odd to even. But how do you detect where that bit is? If you do the same trick with only the first four bits, you can find whether the change is in the upper or lower half. And by counting the first two bits in each half, and the first two in every other half, you can find exactly which bit needs to be corrected. This takes only four bits. But this is a very simple example; there are many other ways to detect and correct errors. For example, Ethernet uses CRCs that are designed to detect burst errors, when several bits in a row change from one to zero.
The Power Delivery specification requires the device and power supply to agree on which power profiles to use. A power supply that can produce a higher voltage profile than the maximum the device can support would not use the higher profile. The 60 Hz on the input is the frequency of the AC power supply. The ubiquity of devices that support 50 and 60 Hz at either 120V or 240V AC will make this unlikely.
they use LARGE data storages. The data is actually stored on special shelves, filling entire rooms with HDDs. Compression is not always the best way, it takes time to unpack and repack it and an additional read/write operation, so if you need fast access to the data, then the data can't be too compressed. And it's much cheaper than it looks. On one of the clouds I use, you can buy a lifetime subscription to a certain space for the price of only one or two hard drives with the same space. They could just as easily go and buy those hard drives, connect them to their system and allocate them to my account, and it would be just as profitable for them.
They are not usually cpu-limited, they are gpu-limited. It takes far more resources to draw a picture and display it on the monitor than to control the artificial intelligence of the worst evil henchmen, so the refresh rate of the game is typically limited by the performance of the graphic chip. The cpu therefore often spends much of its time idle waiting for the gpu to draw a frame. Nonetheless, some games such as RTS (Starcraft) or ARPG (Diablo) can put a greater strain on the cpu by managing large numbers of enemies and their artificial intelligence. Whether the game actually does so depends on how the system allocates resources, but with too many units on the screen, the cpu will have difficulty coping with the numerous simultaneous calculations required for the enemies' artificial intelligence.
The most important reason is the varying settings. Every xbox, every ps5 and every other console is largely identical in terms of hardware, except maybe for the amount of disk space. They run the same way and there's no need to allow for a difference in running. The pc is so different in performance and features that it would be more difficult to find two identical ones. The game producers have to try to create a game that looks good enough so that it doesn't seem outdated, but the requirements are also low enough so that it can be played on lower-end pcs, even if you have to change the settings a little. If they don't do this, they risk alienating one or the other group and missing out on potential profits.
Because consoles are sold at a loss because they recoup their costs through the sale of games.
Just imagine that DNA is a long chain of one particular type of molecule. Each DNA molecule is a long chain of different molecules, called nucleotides. Now, since nature uses only four different nucleotides (some artificial ones have as many as eight), you can store up to two bits per nucleotide. So that’s two bits in a single tiny molecule—it doesn’t get any smaller than that. And since cells have a natural way of copying their own DNA molecules in order to reproduce, all you have to do to copy the information is to add an enzymatic DNA polymerase and more of the same type of nucleotides, then heat the mixture. In essence. Some other steps have to be taken, but that’s the basic idea. The trickier part is to turn the information back into a form that a computer can use. Q: Does the DNA have to be human DNA? A: All DNA molecules are the same chemically. What makes them “human” is simply the information they contain. This question is a bit like asking whether all files are Word documents.
The Random Access Memory or Random Access Memory is a temporary storage for files and data. The more RAM you have, the less game data you need to load and therefore the faster the game runs. Having more RAM also means that everything on the system will use that same memory, from the operating system to the other programs you run, so having more of that memory means you have more space to store game data. But it is only one of the factors that affect the speed of a game. You can have 32 GB of memory, but if your processor or graphic card is slow, you won't get a 4K frame rate of 100 FPS on the latest games.
First, there is no agreed definition of Data Science, and it is often confused with Data Analytics and Data Engineering. Each of these disciplines is usually a specialist field, and depending on how complex the role is, it may or may not include everything... and depending on which company you ask, they may call the same job something different. “Imagine a deadly virus is spreading worldwide.” Imagine the Universities and Research Institutes desperately working together to find a vaccine. They need to collate and analyze millions of tests, experiments and observations from the 7+ billion people on the planet. “Imagine you are a travel agent, one of the largest in the world, and you receive millions of data points each day from the airlines, hotels, customers, guests, businesses, travel agents. Amongst your billions of transactions and data points, which offer is the best for which customer, i.e. where you make the most money, and how you can make more money by changing things here and there, for example, a discount for early booking. “Imagine you are one of the largest customer support companies in the world, handling millions of queries each year. Your manager wants to make the process more cost-effective. So you look at your data: X number of people, Y number of queries and Z number of hours. How can you optimize this? “In essence, you have a huge amount of data. You can either go by your ‘feel’ or your ‘experience’ or you can use the data you collect to work out what is really happening at a macro level, and where the best places to make small changes to get a big effect. * In our case, we found that instead of operating a 24/7 service, it was actually better to operate 8 to 22, with a higher ratio of live calls at lunchtime and evening, as that meant we could be there for customers at the times when they were most likely to contact us. That meant a huge improvement in CSAT, because the waiting time was cut by up to 90%. That’s where Data Science can help. “SYL”
One thing you should know is that encryption uses numbers. You probably already know this, but if not, then let’s remind you, because you are on ELI5 and it will make it easier for you to remember it. Let’s take a two-digit number and multiply it by 101 or 201 or 745301. You get the number you started with. Throw away all but the last two digits. We’ll use that number and divide it up into its factors. What two numbers can you multiply to get 201? 67 and 3. So we can use these two digits as our keys: 67 is the public key and 3 is the private key. Now we have to do it all over again. So take 61. Take the public key, multiply it by 3, and you get 183. Now take the last two digits as our “encrypted” number—83. Now we’re going to multiply 183 by our private key, 67, and get 5561. Take the last two digits and we have the original number. That’s the basic idea behind asymmetric encryption. But it’s not really possible to use multiplication, because you can figure out how it works and then reverse it. But it’s possible to do something similar using different mathematical operations. For example, you can multiply by prime numbers, and in different bases. And there are formulas to generate the numbers you need.
There is an extra step in a lossless format, a way to uncompress or encode the data, and it is dynamic, so the format changes each time. For example, you can compress a book. The lossless compression method notices that the word “the” occurs frequently in the book. It replaces “the” with a new symbol, and the archive used to decompress the file also includes the old symbol for “the.” (The redundant data is that “the” now requires three symbols, instead of just one.) So before the reader can read it, the algorithm must first restore it to normal English. This takes time.
From the man page: Whenever the system is switching from kernel to user mode (for example, after returning from a system call or putting a thread on the CPU), the kernel checks whether there is an unblocked signal for which the process has a signal handler. If there is such a signal, the following steps are executed: The process sends the signal. When a process is started, the system allocates some special functions called signal handlers to it. When the operating system needs the process to run, it first checks the signal set and sees whether the signal applies to this process. Then the handler is executed and the process is resumed, unless the handler stops it.
Certainly. Wear leveling spreads the wear on the entire disk evenly, so that each cell wears out at about the same rate. The larger the disk, the greater the number of writes you can do before you use up a 'layer' of write cycles and start over on the next one.
They don't. Computers don't understand anything the way we do. We design them so that they react in a certain way to certain inputs. Programming is the art and science of setting up the right inputs to produce the desired output. The only language that a computer really understands is machine language, that is, a sequence of on/off digits that switches on or off the different circuits of the computer to perform simple operations like adding two numbers, storing a value, comparing if a value is greater than another, etc. All compilers and interpreters translate everything into machine language and put it into the memory of the CPU, which then just blindly executes it without understanding it.
The general idea is to design fairly large templates for the various circuits needed on the chip, and then photographically or otherwise reduce their size to microscopic dimensions. Then the masks are used, along with a light source and photosensitive materials, to control how the silicon is either added to or etched away from the chip. For example, the chip is first coated with a conductive layer, then with a layer of photoresist, then covered with a mask and exposed to light, after which the photoresist is washed away in the areas that were hit by the light. Then the chip is etched with acid to selectively eat away the conductive layer, leaving behind wires where the photoresist layer was undamaged. This is of course a gross simplification, but you get the idea.
What about you, mate? A3 NAND flash chips (the ones that store the operating system) have a standard pinout. There are machines that you can put hundreds (maybe even thousands) of NAND flash chips in a row, and then program them at the same time., and then they are soldered on the logic board, which is much more convenient and faster than plugging one USB cable into each phone after manufacturing.
A hardware wallet is an independent piece of equipment, like a USB, that contains your crypto-currency (bitcoins, etc.). It's not safe, it's safer. With most crypto-currency, if you get the private key, you get the currency. It is impossible to recover it. So if you store your bitcoins or whatever on your usual Internet-connected device and get hacked, it's lost forever. And there is always a non-zero risk of being hacked from the outside on an Internet-connected device. A hardware wallet isn't connected to anything but your own computer, so the "attack surface" is much smaller... you can't hack it from outside, you have to get physical access to it, you have to attack it for a very short time while it is connected to your computer, and it usually uses specialized software and encryption, so it is harder to hack (and easier to secure) than a normal commercially available device. That's much more difficult, but not impossible. Hence safer, but not safe. You can go as far as printing your private keys on paper or something, and destroying the digital copies. Then it is absolutely safe, you have to physically steal or watch the paper.
Two things. Virtualization is not the same as emulation. Virtualization is a simulation of the real hardware, and emulation is a simulation of completely different hardware. By virtualization, for example, it is possible to use a single x86-based computer to emulate three different computers. Emulation, for example, makes it possible to pretend that a PC is a Super NES or a Sony PlayStation. ISO was originally a file used to burn CDs. It was a way to keep on the hard disk what was written on the CD or what should be written on the CD. As optical drives became less and less popular, it became more and more common to use such a file and make the program act as if it were a hardware optical drive. Today, the ability to mount an ISO file as a virtual drive is integrated into the operating system. ROM is a file that contains the contents of a game cartridge. These files are then read by emulators that emulate the consoles and pretend that they are loading into the console. But you have to remember that the memory card is not only for storing data, like a CD or a DVD, but also for implementing additional hardware, such as additional memory or a three-dimensional sound card. This can usually be emulated.
A fax machine basically scans an image, normally a document, and then converts it into a digital signal that can be sent over the telephone network to another fax machine, which will then answer the phone and receive the digital signal. Most fax machines are set to receive the call automatically and begin printing out the sent image, but it is also possible to adjust them to be answered only by a manual response, so that no faxes will be printed out unless you push the button. It is a kind of low-tech way of taking a photo with your mobile phone and sending the photo to someone.
MAINLY OLED is an organic, fluorescent-like material which can emit light of different colors in its own light, which means it is a kind of LCD; QLED is an kind of LED, and OLED is a kind of organic, fluorescent-like material; the latter two are just a different kind of chemical combination. Secondly, OLED can do high dynamic range. High Dynamic Range has several standards: HDR10 (low-cost) Dolby Vision (more expensive) An explanation of how the screens work and their advantages and disadvantages: ###  LCD, @@@ a large white backlight passes through an LCD panel, which is, in essence, a bunch of light-transmitting particles that change the white light into red, green and blue. Because these filters are not completely transparent, the black color is not very good on the LCD. ### LED, @@@ because it is impossible to make a large white LED, but instead uses a panel with many small LEDs. Because LED is more energy-efficient. The advantage of the many small lights is that you can dim the lights individually, and the black color is more layered and blacker. ### QLED, @@@ instead of using a yellow filter, it is covered with a layer of small fluorescent particles, called "quantum dots", and the light is emitted after absorbing the light, so it is a form of fluorescent. These fluorescent particles are some red, some green, and some are blue. When you combine them with blue LEDs, you get white light, but the white light is more pure than that of the ordinary LED, and the color is more accurate, and the power is more economical. ### OLED, @@@ OLED does not use backlight, the sub-pixel is the light, and there is no need for any filter, and red, blue and green are made directly by the material. This means that you can dim the light and turn off the light for dark colors and black. The color is the most accurate and blackest. But it's expensive, and the light is not as bright as QLED (now).
RAID basically means using more than one hard drive to provide better data backup and recovery, which is the main benefit. The disadvantages are the cost of buying more hard drives and the need for specialized hardware and software to implement the RAID functionality. RAID 0 is essentially just mirroring the data across multiple hard drives, which does not protect your data from loss but does speed up performance. The downside is that losing a single hard drive in the RAID array means the whole array is affected, as your data is broken up over all of them. RAID 1 is simply a mirroring of one drive to another. This is the simplest form of data backup and recovery, as you have an exact copy of your data on a second drive. But it is not the most efficient. RAID 2 is a different implementation of RAID 0. RAID 0 spreads data across individual drives in chunks called blocks, while RAID 2 does it bit by bit. RAID 2 also does a simple form of error correction, while RAID 0 does not. RAID 3 is similar to RAID 0 and RAID 2, but uses a method called byte-stripping, which spreads data across multiple drives byte by byte, with a dedicated parity drive. The parity drive is a separate drive that looks up the data on all the other drives and stores the error correction code for those blocks of data. In the case of RAID 3, if the first byte on the first drive is 01010101, the second byte on the second drive is 00001111 and the first byte on the third drive is 00111100, then the parity drive looks at the first byte on all the other drives and counts the number of ones that appear in each bit position. Then it records a 0 if there are an even number of ones, and a 1 if there are an odd number. It records it in the following way: First Drive 01010101 |@@@ |Second Drive |00001111 |@@@ |Third Drive | 00111100 |@@@ |Parity Drive 01100110 | Having a parity drive means that if you lose one drive, you can recover the data by looking at the remaining bytes and the parity by looking up the correct one. RAID 4 is like RAID 3 but with the parity blocks distributed across all the drives in the array rather than relying on a dedicated parity drive. The reason this is better is that the parity blocks are only needed when a drive fails. Having all the parity blocks on a single drive means that the drive is almost completely unused, which causes the other drives to wear out faster. Using the entire array means all the drives wear out together, which increases the risk of failure. RAID 6 is like RAID 5, but with two parity blocks for every data block, so you can lose up to two hard drives.
Before launchers, you had to do patch installation by hand. No one wants to do that anymore. Launchers make it easy to update and configure the game.
No matter what you do to the game, in the end the memory has to contain unencrypted program code so that the game can be executed. The game creators can encrypt their program code, but they can't escape the fact that in order for the game to run, it has to decrypt it somewhere and then load it into memory. There are tools called memory debuggers that can show what is in the memory, as it happens. This can be used to find out where the decrypted code is. With a lot of work and careful study, you can find out where the game makes the decision whether to think of itself as licensed. With a lot of work and careful study, you might even figure out how the code is encrypted and decrypt it, or at least how to make modifications to the encrypted code. This can only be done "without a hole" if the encryption of program code was an inherent part of the cpu and memory. In this way the program would store encrypted code in the memory, and the cpu would decrypt it on the fly in some special internal memory that debuggers are not able to read. I think the reason why this is not done is because it would be extremely complicated and not all programs have this much to do with copy protection. They would have trouble debugging it during development. @ @ The game and the cpu would have to agree on how the program is encrypted and how it should be decrypted, and a cracker could intercept this negotiation and learn how to decrypt the code. In essence, game creators can not make their games uncrackable. They just try to make it so difficult that most people who want to play have bought the game before a crack is released. If the game's success is measured in how many people bought it in the first week, it just has to be long enough to crack it. The film industry is similar, often only the first two weeks of the movie count for "good" success, and the studios have to focus on the same window. As long as it takes a pirate to make a copy, the studio is not bothered by that.
It enables you to do multi-threaded things in a much more efficient way. For example, you can watch a YouTube movie while you're working or playing a game, or whatever.
The bar code reader actually reads the white space between the lines, and depending on how large it is, it assigns a number to it. When you scan something, you get a number, then that number is assigned to something else, like an apple.
Imagine you are an artist who can see a 3D object in front of him through a window. Then you take your pallet and your tiniest brush (you’re a pointillist) and cover the glass with dots of paint that match the exact colors of the object you’re looking at. In the end, you have a 2D painting of a 3D object. In essence, that’s what the computers do when they display 3D images. They use a lot of clever formulas to speed up the process, but the basic idea is that they look at each pixel on the screen and ask themselves, “What would this pixel look like if the viewer were looking at the 3D object through it?”
I know of two basic methods. The first is “laser” : With a essentially simple gluing gun, a layer of plastic is melted onto the surface. Under computer control, the gun lays down the exact contours of the object desired. The plastic solidifies very quickly, so that a new layer can be glued on top. In this way, layer after layer, a three-dimensional object is created. The second method is photo-chemical: This time the build surface is placed upside down in a bath of a liquid which solidifies under the action of a laser beam. Under computer control, the beam solidifies the liquid next to the build surface in the exact shape desired. The build surface is then lifted slightly out of the liquid, and the liquid is solidified again, next to the first layer. In this way, layer after layer, the build surface is lifted, and the liquid is solidified into the three-dimensional object. Let me now change my opening statement to include a word of my own.
A game engine is a tool for creating a game. A game engine can be compared to an artist's studio. If you go to a sculptor's studio, he will have all the tools necessary to make a sculpture, arranged logically, and there are also materials and other helpers. If you go to a painter's studio, you will find a few of the tools needed for making a sculpture, but not all, and they are not easy to find because they do not use them or use them for something else. So game engines are generally made for game genres, but if you want to make a space flight simulator, then the tools in a game engine that is mainly designed for 2D sidescrollers are probably not the best.
A virtual machine is like a computer within a computer. Consider an office with four employees. The foreman (the user) comes in, orders two of them to work on a different project, and builds partitions around them. That’s a virtual machine. It uses part of the main system’s resources to run a separate machine that’s almost completely isolated from the main system. This means that you can run viruses or other applications without harming the main system, because there’s no way for the virtual machine to access any files outside its own VM.
Because all the 3D rendering is done on another machine. Watching a gaming video is like watching any other high quality movie. Your pc is capable of playing a high quality movie no matter what the movie is.
In addition to the additional pair of wires for super-speed information over what is available on the USB 3.0 Type-A plug, it also offers a few extra pins for other purposes. This allows the “dual-lane” (I can’t remember the official name) mode of USB 3.1 to use all four super-speed pairs (two for each direction), or enables situations such as the combination of DisplayPort and USB on the same cable.
In most cases, it's just a change in texture. When the game is created, the graphical models are created, limited by the tools of the creators and the hardware that will run it. For the HD version, they make new graphical models and simply replace the old ones. Some are passed through a computer and they just make it X times bigger and sharper, but that's a pretty bad way of doing it.
You’re using less memory to share the same amount of information. Suppose you have a text file containing an excerpt from the Rolling Stones’ song Start Me Up. Let xxx stand for “if you start me up” and yyy for “never stop.” Now we represent the words “if you start me up” and “never stop” with these two ciphers, and your shortened lyrics would be:
Video is like a flip book. Playing a game is like drawing the flip book as you go.
The way they work is in base-2 arithmetic, it’s just like base-10 which you are used to, only it only uses two numbers. Base-ten is counting from 0 to 9, then you add a zero and count from 10 to 19, and so on. In base-2 you count from 0 to 1 and then add a zero and count again. The only difference is that you add zeros faster. Here’s a little chart for you to convert from base-ten to base-2: 0 = 0, 1 = 1, 2 = 10, 3 = 11, 4 = 100, 5 = 101, 6 = 110, 7 = 111, 8 = 1000, 9 = 1001, 10 = 1010, and so on. It only takes two digits to count as high as you want. Each digit that represents a 0 or a 1 is called a bit. It’s short for Binary digIT. One byte is eight bits and it can represent any digit from 0 to 255 like this: 0 = 00000000... 255 = 11111111 And you go on like that and assign a digit to all the letters, numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and symbols, and so on. You even assign a digit to each pixel on the screen, and you assign digits to the various colors. Computers are very good at storing and retrieving information, so by putting everything in the form of numbers, it’s easy to store, retrieve, and process anything you want. When you get down to it, even the languages are not that different. At the very basic level, there are only very simple languages in which numbers represent the simplest commands. For example, a + can be assigned a digit, so can a - and so can an x. Later on, you learn mathematical operations that have names like AND and OR and NOT. You learn still others, a bit more complicated, that have names like IF and THEN. When you put it all together, you can write a program that will operate on all those symbols according to the rules you make up. There is no translation going on between a concept and a 0 or a 1. The parts operate mathematically on the bits, and that’s all. The meaning is in the collection of those bits and in the way they are arranged and arranged. It’s just like that paragraph you are reading. For you it has meaning, because you know English. For the machine it’s just a string of numbers that have no special meaning. But between the reader and me there are all sorts of programs that make it appear to you as letters on a screen, and you have to interpret it. It’s a bit more complicated than that, and the wires are very small, but basically, when your game is running, the CPU sends signals through wires to the memory, which responds with the memory contents, and the CPU operates on those and sends wire signals to the graphic card, which translates them into a command to light up the various pixels in a certain order and color and so on.
It's kind of the nervous system that controls and connects all the other components.
The power supply only provides a certain amount of voltage, electrical pressure. The amount of current that is allowed to flow is up to the device itself. A refrigerator generally uses a simple temperature controller, a switch that is connected to a thermometer. When the temperature is too low, the controller switches the fridge off. When it gets too warm, the controller switches the fridge back on. If a CPU does nothing, it consumes very little power. But there is a short current pulse each time the tiny switches inside it change state, from high to low, on to off. If a CPU (or a portion of it) is sleeping, it does nothing and does not use any power. Then, when it is doing something, the switches inside it turn on and off many times and thus use power. A modern CPU can also vary the speed it runs at, depending on the workload. A lower speed (or lower GHz) means fewer switches change state per second, so it uses less power.
Most often because, although it looks like it has started, it has not finished loading. The items in the system tray all load after the OS has started. You need to wait until all this stuff has loaded. Then it feels like it's running faster, because there is no longer any interference with system resources (disk, memory, CPU) from other loading processes.
The Internet is not some magic whirlwind. It is merely servers interconnected. The servers have hard drives. Large servers, i.e., SANs, are connected to the servers. Hence the storage capacity is infinite because one just buys more SANs. At my workplace I am currently spending another million dollars on SANs, which will give us another petabyte of storage. As long as storage capacity can be created, the Internet/Cloud will continue to grow.
This is where they have to be saved, and it's the easiest place to do it. The folder is called a "documents folder" depending on the language, so it's a question of "what's the full path to the documents folder?" But since there is no special save file folder, it's necessary to handle it internally, so it isn't unified with the rest of the system. There is also the place that the folder called "Documents" is usually backed up when you back up something, and that's the place where the file is usually transferred between multiple devices, so it's easy to use.
Because the amount of data increases as the number of characters increase. For example, if a 21-character QR code is encoded, the data it encodes is small, but a 177-character one can encode more than 4,096 bytes because it has about 37,000 characters. (Many of the characters are not used for encoding, but for camera calibration.)
They don’t. They are programmed to understand how far they have to move, according to the rotation of a gear or screw.
To continue with the book analogy, it compresses all the useless data—the spaces in this case—and prints it on a fraction of the paper. And it makes a note of the words it condensed, so it can print the whole book if you ask it to.
There are two parts to the answer. First, the problem of synchronizing the data across the multiple GPUs because they cannot easily communicate. Second, it would be extremely expensive. The normal way a frame is rendered, all the components of the GPU access the same framebuffer (VRAM) at very high speed (think hundreds of GB/s). The PCI-Express memory bus, however, is a small fraction of this (a few dozen GB/s at best). So when you try to synchronize the rendering across two or more GPUs, you're suddenly trying to synchronize it at a fraction of the memory bandwidth you're used to. And while there were earlier proprietary implementations of multi-GPU that used a proprietary bus, they also only went to a few GB/s and were phased out in favor of PCI-Express for later SLI and Crossfire implementations. But either way, it's still a long way behind the framebuffer. In the past, people have used tricks like alternating frames between the GPUs or splitting the frame between them. But these tricks are becoming less and less feasible as games become more and more "screen-space" (as it's called) based on effects like AA, ambient occlusion, reflections, and motion blur. As part of these effects, the components of the GPU have to access different parts of the frame. These are things that modern drivers and games simply don't care to do. Now on to the second part: Why wouldn't they? The answer is that it's just not worth it. If you want a more powerful GPU, just make a more powerful GPU. The GPU is already a very parallel piece of technology, so scaling it up is cheap. Multi-GPU only fills the niche for those who want even more power than the most powerful single-GPU cards on the market. The solution to that has always been to make more expensive GPUs. The Nvidia RTX 3090, for example, has a price of $1,500. It's the equivalent of a three-way SLI in the past. And Nvidia's RTX Titan RTX costs even more at $2,500. And that's what you're getting for the price. A multi-GPU solution would add more problems than it's worth.
It's based on finding patterns and ways to represent those patterns in a smaller space. For example, which is shorter: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa or 2aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?
That’s what electrical engineering is—a bundle of wires connecting things. Except they use acid to etch the copper on a plastic PCB to make it neater, and then they paint it green to insulate it. Then the same thing is done with microchips, but at an extreme level of miniaturization. Essentially, wires connect various things, but in order to make them that small, you need to use a process similar to photography to etch the components into the chip. Like with photography, there’s a chemical that turns black when it’s exposed to light, but if you expose it briefly to an image that has bright parts and dark parts, the chemical darkens to correspond to the image, and that’s how you get a picture. The machines project the actual circuit (designed in CAD) onto the substance, which consists of layers of silicon (transistors, resistors, etc.) and metal layers that are applied or etched away. In repeated runs through the machine, the layers of the microchip are populated with a combination of wiring and IC components. Basically, a microchip is like a big abacus: the state of the ICs and the voltage in memory cells keep track of numbers. And when the chip does its work, it repeatedly changes the numbers to accomplish whatever the program tells it to. That’s basically how it works. But instead of 1010, it’s 101920—the number of dots that could be on a computer monitor; the graphics processing unit simply calculates a number for each dot that determines how bright it should be. Here’s a video about how microchips are made:
There are many things that can cause a crash, from a simple error in the code where a certain value is expected but not yet set, to cosmic rays, which change one bit in the memory. As for why the program can't go on running... it can, if it was designed to deal with the error that occurs. This is the principle... try... catch... if the thing doesn't go as expected... well... That's the problem, that you need to design the program specifically to deal with a certain error, and many times the error comes from something that is not foreseen. Furthermore, if you check for and catch all errors, the program becomes bigger and slower. Then you get something like "windows has encountered an unknown error" or something similar. It is precisely because of this that it happens. Moreover, once an error has been thrown, it is often the best thing for the program to stop, because continuing may result in data corruption. The above is a colossal simplification of a complex matter... but I hope that at least it is understandable, as my ravings often fail to do so.
It's been programmed, it works by applying the laws of motion and forces you learned in physics class to every 3D object. It does this using the basic algebra of mathematical modeling to figure out where to move objects when they collide.
[Raw video is big, so videos are encoded to save space. The 4K video is likely encoded at a higher bit rate, which takes advantage of the potential of 4K. Compression works by removing details and finding similarities across multiple pixels, so taking a high-bitrate 4K and reducing it to 1080p doesn't lose as much quality as you might expect.] As a note, bitrates and resolutions don't always work together. A high-resolution video at a given bit rate can be better or worse than a lower-resolution one at the same bit rate. A higher resolution can show more detail, but if the details aren't there, then the higher resolution makes it easier to see the lower quality. See the chart at https://teradek.com/blogs/articles/ What's the optimum bitrate for your resolution?
A machine whose purpose can be varied. A toaster is a toaster, a refrigerator is a refrigerator. They serve a narrow set of tasks. A computer, on the other hand, can be set up to perform anything as long as it has the necessary hardware. This seems obvious now because everyone has a computer, but no such machine existed until the middle of the twentieth century. This ability to change its purpose is called “being programmed.” It is even possible to program a toaster or a refrigerator. A mathematical definition of a computer, the Turing-Church hypothesis, claims that any function which can be solved by a computer can also be solved by any other mathematical process.
What’s that? The answers that the teacher gave were probably very shoddy. I can’t say for sure since I only read one of the answers, but any teacher who is reluctant to answer a question more than once or who will not explain the concept properly before going on to the next, is a bad teacher. That’s not the way you teach people to think; that’s the way you teach people to parrot. In any case, the electric current is run through a wire or a die, depending on whether the EDM is wire-cutting or sink-cutting, and atoms of the metal are melted and removed from the granular structure of the metal. The high-voltage current corrodes the metal, which is why the dies of sink-cutting EDMs are made of graphite, which is highly conductive and resistant to high temperatures and high voltages. In wire-cutting EDMs, the dies are made of a continuous wire. If the wire was a short piece, it would break after cutting for only a second. If the die were made of a material that couldn’t withstand the current, it would be corroded and destroyed as much as or even more than the piece being cut. It’s important to note that the wire or the die never actually touches the workpiece. It gets close enough to arc and the front of the workpiece is melted. If you go too fast and actually touch the workpiece, that can have some very bad effects. This would be my first guess if you described what happened to you. You must have set up the machine in some other way and run the die too fast or used the wrong settings. I don’t know if that’s possible; it’s just my first guess.
You don’t have to teach a computer to understand the meaning of a 0 or a 1, you build it that way. The logic for the real basic things is in the design. In the case of the first proto-computers, the "reprograming” was done literally by rewiring. The secret of the programmable computer is that all the basic logic is already there, the only thing that is external is the order of the basic operations and the input values.
Imagine you are an accountant and you have to add up the total of your company. You can do it with a simple text editor, by typing all the figures, then adding everything up, then typing the total again, and then again copying the figures where you want to use them in the other calculations, and so on. You think to yourself that there must be a better way. Since so many people have to do this work, couldn't someone have developed a tool to do such everyday tasks? And then you hear about Excel. In Excel you enter the numbers and enter a formula, like = SUM (A1:A20), and then you hit ENTER and the total comes out. All this done for you. That's how it is with graphic engines. For example, let's say you have to program the illumination in a game. You could program it all by hand, how the light reflects from different objects, how the camera views them, how reflections work, how different clothes look in different light, and so on. But then someone has probably already made it. Someone has made a program where I can just draw a room and draw an armor and say that the light is here and this is a shiny metal armor, and it does all the calculations and work for me, right? That's a graphic engine. It's a program that makes general graphic calculations for the programmers. You still have to program something, you still have to supply the images, but the basic tasks like lighting, shadow, color, and so on. Some are better than others (engine A has better shadows than engine B), some are faster, some are cheaper, etc., and all work differently and result in different things. But you can also use the same engine and get better graphics by providing more detailed objects and animations or by learning to use the same engine better (just as learning Excel's advanced features makes it possible to make more complicated sheets).
The clock speed of a GPU determines how often one single transistor can switch in a time period (a 100 MHz transistor can switch 100.000 times a second) and multiply that with the number of these ICs that are in the IC. This speed is set in commercial units because it is the best compromise between speed, power consumption and heat generation (because it turns out that a semi-conductor turns on more often when current flows through it) - the ability to overclock means that the GPU can be tuned to run at a higher frequency than it was originally designed for. In a moderate manner, modern CPUs and GPUs tolerate a lot of abuse because of the way they are made and tested. But the higher you go, the more heat and power dissipation you need. And because other components such as memory rely on the "clock" being in sync, going too far ahead will lead to a system crash before it can cause any serious damage.
It’s the underlying technology, the blockchain, that creates the damage. The blockchain is a method of keeping a decentralized ledger, and it requires a great deal of energy to work. That’s true no matter what you build on top of it. If you have a central controlling authority, the blockchain is redundant and doesn’t add anything to the system. Obviously, bitcoin is bad, because you always need someone to verify the transactions. From an energy perspective, though, the problem is with mining the new blocks, not verifying the transactions.
It is a big subject. The simplest way that general-purpose digital computers work is by following a stored program. They read the next part of the program, execute the next command, read the next part of the program, execute that command, read the next part of the program, execute that command. Repeat this forever. General-purpose digital computers are special-purpose digital devices designed to repeat this process over and over again, as fast as possible. The power of these devices lies in the fact that they can perform a variety of different operations, depending on the details of the instructions they follow. The same machine can be used for a variety of different purposes, which are easily and quickly changed. The set of instructions is called the program and is the result of an engineering discipline called software engineering. In fact, the program is represented by numbers stored in a series of memory cells in the computer. Early programs were written as a string of numbers by programmers, but now there are better ways of representing them called languages that are translated into numbers (by other programs called assemblers, compilers, and interpreters). Hence the process of generating numerical program information has become much more efficient in the last forty or fifty years, and it has become practical and commonplace to produce much more complex software. I hope this helps.
... Assembly came along in 1949, and it was the first widely used language in which the instructions directly equated with the underlying machine code, which could be interpreted from the instructions. Three years later came the first compiler, which converted the instructions into machine code. It had several predecessors. For further developments see Ada Lovelace.
“Kernel” is a tangled term, and there is some arbitrary classification of kernels. But the main difference now is the concept of privilege separation. The kernel is the part of the operating system that has direct access to the hardware—which is something that ordinary programs or many other parts of the operating system, even core system services, are normally forbidden to do. The kernel is strictly separated from the rest of the system, and when a program needs to do something that involves the hardware, such as write a file to storage, the program will go through the kernel, and the kernel will do it. Generally speaking, it is not safe to give things that do not need to have the power. So the kernel will gradually move everything out of it and into the so-called “user space.” It should be noted that the so-called “user space” is not the same as the so-called “user” on the device, and “user space” can include core system services with superuser privileges.
Frame-works and libraries are all codes written by someone to help write a program. A framework is a program written by someone else that you adapt. You hook up to the framework and make the program do your job. A library is a code written by someone else that you plug into your program. In this case, you write your own program and insert the code of someone else to save time or to make your code easier to read. If you are familiar with Java or some similar language, if they wrote the main method, it's a framework. If you wrote the main method, it's a library.
It was done by hand, on paper. You could do that today by coding the program in an assembly language and then translating it to machine code, it wouldn't be a fun or a fast task, but it could be done. But how did the machine code get to the machine? One answer is that very early computers like the ENIAC used actual switches and wiring looms [you can see that in the picture]. ] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Two_women_operating_ENIAC.gif) So the "software" was not something you loaded, but was physically manipulated by people. The other method was using punched cards or punched tapes, which were invented long before computers and which were used by the first machines of the 40s, to store the programs and data. Punch cards have been used to control textile machinery since 1725, on a large scale since 1801, and for communication from 1846 onwards, with telegraphic telegraphy, Morse code, and other systems. Between World War I and World War II, they were used for automatic data transmission, in electro-mechanic systems. It was pretty much the same as the punched tape, but it had to be adapted to work with mechanical and electro-mechanical systems before there were any digital computers. The US census of 1890 was processed using punch cards and tabulating machines. The 80  10 IBM cards, which came out in 1928, and were the standard in the industry, were used up to the seventies. There were machines that made punch cards and tapes before the computers, and it was even possible to make them by hand with a piercing tool; a proper guide for putting the holes in the right places was an advantage, but not technically necessary.
[eli5] Hello :) Generally, you print the pieces and assemble them. Many things need some hardware like bolts, screws, or are simply cheaper (or stronger) to combine with existing products. For example, metal bearings are less slippery than movable parts made of plastic. But it's possible to print movable parts all at once. For example, a car that's pulled back. As long as the bearings are large enough and the used material is strong enough. There are even some companies that print entire engine parts (with metal powder and laser sintering) that would have to be welded or bolted together otherwise. But 3D printers themselves are also being printed, but mainly for the frame. The Snappy project, for example, is able to print about 80% of the parts needed for itself. But this is not always the most economical and functional way.
An older computer is less powerful than newer ones. Programs and web pages grow and may not run well on old machines. Older software may suffer from the hard drive getting fragmented (on the old-fashioned hard disk) or the size of the registry or other configuration files getting bigger. This happens especially if you often install and uninstall and do not put temporary files on a separate partition. Speed can be increased by reinstalling the operating system and adding only required applications and drivers. As long as the machine is not broken, its performance does not decrease. But it is often required more. If the machine gets really dirty, the heat-generating components can be damaged, but then the effect is very obvious, the machine is turned off, the fans run very fast, or the performance is drastically reduced.
Hard drives use spinning metal platters like a CD, but what they do is “write” data by making a spot magnetized, north or south. And then when you want to read data, you just read whether it's north or south and get the data back. On a CD, the shiny layer reflects the laser. If the light bounces back, it's a north pole. If it bounces off, it's a south pole. That's how you read it. Writable CDs have a layer of ink to block the light. It chars a spot to make a one, or doesn't burn a spot to make a zero. Rewritable CDs deform the metal surface to make a one, or leave it as it is to make a zero. This is kind of like a hard drive.
That is why one should learn assembler. Assembler is the closest thing to the actual hardware. A program in assembler basically looks like this: Move this number from this memory to that memory. Add this number and this number. If they're equal, jump to this instruction. The hardware is 'hard-wired' with these ‘move, add, compare, jump’ etc. That's what doesn't change. How you combine these basic operations to create end-user applications is what's difficult. We invented operating systems to make it easier to work with the different hardware components, and then we invented higher level languages to introduce concepts like object-oriented programming, inheritance, constructors, multi-dimensional arrays, multi-threading etc. But in the end, all these higher-level languages are nothing but a long list of ‘move, add, compare, jump’ instructions.
It’s simple. Rendering can be done in many different ways, with a focus on quality (like in Maya or Blender) or on speed (like in games). These two goals may require completely different algorithms (which is a way of working) and data. These two ways are so different that the names are also different. Real-time rendering: should happen in fractions of a second. The image quality should be as good as possible in the time available, but the most important thing is to stay fast. Used by games for example. Offline rendering: must be very good. The calculation time must of course be as short as possible, but the quality is most important. Used by for example CGI movies - such as Pixar's films and similar.
Remember when you were a child and your dad asked you to bring him a 7/16-inch socket, a screwdriver, and a bolt as he worked on his car? You were the RAM and he was the CPU.
raspberries are a type of very basic and inexpensive computers made by the MIT foundation. These are basically very small boards with a small CPU, memory and other basic things, plus some connections for things like USB or ethernet cables. They do not have much power, but they are small and inexpensive, so they are good if you need a computer that just runs some basic program and nothing else, or if you need to control something where you can't use a full-size computer.
The external port: This is the port number on the server outside the network. The internal port: This is the port number on the server inside the network. It is often the same as the external port, but it doesn’t have to be. External port: This is the port that the people outside the network use to connect to the server. This, basically, can be regarded as the port open on the router, not on the server. Let’s take a server with an internal IP of 127.9.8.7 running a server on port 1234: Within the network you can connect to the server on port 1234 and everything will work fine. Now, let’s imagine your router has the IP address of 20.20.20.20. This is the address that people outside the network use to connect to your network. Now, in your network there might be dozens of computers, and many of them could be running a server. How can the router find the specific server on your machine? This is where the external port comes in. You can tell the router, “Every time someone tries to connect to 20.20.20.20, send it to 127.9.8.7, port 1234.” Then, when someone from outside wants to connect to your server, they send their request to port 9999 on 20.20.20.20, and the router forwards it to 127.9.8.7, port 1234. This is the external port, and 1234 is the internal port. Inbound and outbound should be self-explanatory. The inbound traffic goes to your machine, and the outbound traffic goes away from your machine. The source: where the request comes from, the destination: where it goes.
A keyboard still has one or more drivers. They're just the stock drivers your system has on it. When you plug in a graphics card, it works on an integrated standard driver with a limited feature set. But if you want to do some of the fancy things it can do, you need a new driver that was not in the operating system at the time. So if you have a keyboard with fancy RGB lighting or macros, you may also need an additional keyboard driver for the same reason.
It depends on what you mean by cleaning up a hard drive.
The game code on a regular copy of the game is the compiled code—which has been translated, enhanced, and rewritten into a language that the machine can understand. If you opened it in a text editor, it would be a mess. The source code, however, is written in a language that humans understand. If you opened it in a text editor, it would look like letters and words. Even if you don’t know the coding language, you could still read it, or at least bits and pieces of it. Depending on the language, some compiled codes can be decompiled into source code. For example, there are some tools that will translate Java from compiled code. The resulting code won’t be identical to the original, but it will still perform the same function. However, this is only true of the coding language. There are many other aspects of game design—for example, 3D models and sound effects—and maybe someone more knowledgeable about them could provide a more complete answer. But the underlying problem of the difference between a machine-readable code and a human-readable code is a fundamental problem that prevents someone from going from one to the other.
Both are encoding standards for text. ASCII is an old standard that uses a byte for each character. It is essentially English-centric and can't represent much beyond the Latin alphabet, which is a problem for content not in English. Unicode is a more recent standard that supports the full range of characters available in Unicode, which is intended to cover every human language and some besides. UTF-8 is backwards-compatible with ASCII, so programs designed for ASCII will still work with UTF-8, and UTF-8 programs will still work with ASCII, which is important because of the huge number of legacy ASCII-only systems out there. There are other standards like UTF-16 or UCS-2, but UTF-8 is easier to work with and is generally more efficient in general, so you should try to encode text as UTF-8 whenever possible (the web is already 93.4 % UTF-8).
A secret message is always a sequence of numbers, 1s and 0s. To encrypt it, you create another, arbitrary-looking number of the same size and do XOR on them. (This simply replaces the bit in the original with the opposite bit, if the corresponding bit in the random number is 1). To decrypt, you need the encrypted data and the same random number. XOR(A, B) will be equal to C —— XOR(C, B) will be equal to A. The random number is not really random. It's generated by an algorithm from the password (the key). The same password will always generate the same random number. But the random number cannot be deduced from the password.
The iso is a collection of files. A live/bootable USB is a USB with a specific format. Just like your computer, it is formatted, has a boot sector, a file system, and may contain other partitions as well. For a linux distro, you usually have two or more partitions. The flash utility doesn’t just copy the files, it prepares the USB drive. It formats the drive, writes the boot sector, extracts the files into the correct directory, and checks everything for errors.
Encryption as a whole is not rendered obsolete by the speeding-up of computers, but certain methods are. Encryption in general relies on mathematical methods which are quick to perform, but very slow to decipher. When a computer becomes sufficiently fast, a process which was once out of the question becomes feasible; but to make up for this the strength of the encryption is increased, for example by increasing the size of the problem.
When a file is deleted, the operating system does not really delete the file. It only marks the location of the file as being free to write over.
They’re the things you can access with the get and set keywords. The idea is to allow encapsulation, which means that the programmer who creates the class can do things that are hidden from the programmer who uses the class. Here’s a piece of C# code: class Human narcissistic; class compulsiveLiar; class mentions; class realname; class fakename; A programmer who accesses the Name property of a class knows he or she will get a name, but all sorts of other things can be happening.
drivers tell gpu how to do certain things efficiently. Newer gpu sometimes have no driver for older applications.
It is indeed a bad idea, but it is worse than the alternative. The purpose of the caps is to give the CPU enough power. A CPU's power consumption varies significantly. On each cycle it flips millions of switches, all of which need to be powered at once. And in addition entire blocks of logic can be turned on and off. The current has to flow through the wires from the power supply. So the chips need to have the power source as close as possible. Putting the caps a few centimeters away is not enough. They have to be long enough for the power supply to provide enough juice, otherwise the chip might not work properly. It might even run out of juice on every clock.
The game contains many high-resolution custom textures. In order to have a big, open battlefield map, a lot of different things must be included, and these all need their own textures.
It all started with the IBM Personal Computer. It sold well, so there were a lot of third-party peripherals and accessories that were "compatible" with it. The Macintosh was the only non-compatible machine on the market, so you ended up with PCs (compatible with IBM PC) and Macs (compatible with Macintosh but not with PCs).
Suppose you are at the source of a river where it divides into five branches. Downstream, there are five water wheels which raise a flag when the water in the river below them reaches a certain level. By means of a certain reservoir, you can send the water to one, several, or none of these water wheels. Then your dam technology is getting more and more complicated, and most importantly, smaller! So you can build small dams at each stage of the branch, and you have communication between the dams so that you can have a flag which rises when branch 1 has water but not branch 2; or only if both branch 1 and 2 have water; or only if neither has water. Eventually you will need more branches to make the most of the possibilities—arithmetic! —but it’s fine, because the source dam fills up far faster than you can ever release water. Then you could end up with millions of branches. Soon you have a grid of 640480 water wheels—a monitor—and a group of workers who control the source of the river—a keyboard. And if you have built this little dam in a certain way, you have a computer.
It doesn't. And the long answer is that it doesn't and the theory of special relativity doesn't allow not only matter, but also any kind of information to go faster than light.
Depending on the game. Some games are built on platforms that support multiple operating systems. In this case, most of the work has already been done and you only have to find the bugs that are specific to your game. Paths to the operating system being interpreted differently and similar things can take some time to find and fix. You may have to install it in a different way and include other libraries and so on for it to work. So it's often like this: The main release is for Windows and then the bugs for the other operating systems are released when the developer has time to fix them. But some games are built on platforms and libraries that are not used everywhere. The major distinction used to be DirectX, but it's no longer. There are still libraries that are badly supported on other operating systems. And if you have written much of the game engine yourself, you may have made many different assumptions that are correct for Windows but not for the other operating systems. How the windows work, whether they support full-screen, how the events are handled, where the files are saved and so on. Although the game itself technically should work on all operating systems, all these small things that together make up a large part of the code but do not have to do with the game must be completely rewritten.
What would that accomplish? Spreading important files out over many folders so that deleting one of them causes your PC to crash doesn’t seem like an improvement.
Easy, the metadata in a photograph. The photo itself is the data, and the metadata is the data about the photograph. Location, date, time, size, resolution, exposure, and so on.
Originally, it was a legacy limit for backwards compatibility. Besides, in the newer versions of Windows, the limit can be disabled by enabling the “Enable long file names” feature in local policy.
They don't, unless we're talking about profit. Here is a whack-up of a rather old black HP ink cartridge. The most complicated bit is the ink jet controller. It turns out it's quite complicated to control these things. The other circuitry is purely for nonsense like setting an expiration date or identifying the cartridge number if the printer or manufacturer is interested. They don't need it.
The contents of the RAM are wiped when you start a new session, and usually a good deal of it is wiped when you turn off the program that's using it (like a game). But you still need some minimum level of available memory to run some applications. A 128-meg gaming PC will be able to load and manage data for a modern game, but if the games were only available from a single vendor, they would cost a few hundred kroner. This 128-meg memory won't be enough to handle the entire operating system, much less an operating system and a game.
Factors: 1) Bigger CPUs mean more transducers, which means more heat, which means melted CPUs. Even the existing CPUs have problems with dissipating heat, so it seems a little risky to add more heat. 2) We're running into the speed of light! Despite the fact that the speed of light is very, very fast, it's becoming a problem in computers: if the chip is too big, the signals won't be able to get from the source to the destination in time. 3) Finally, bigger CPUs mean more risk of defects during fabrication. Doubling the size of the chip means quadrupling the surface area, and that means quadrupling the risk of a flaw that makes the whole thing unusable.
Data mining is nothing more than digging around in the data files of a game for hidden gems. For instance, if a new character is supposed to be added, its art assets might be packed into the game data, even if the character isn’t actually in the game yet.
Worst-case scenario, you have to rewrite almost everything. In older generations, the systems were a bit more different, such as N64, PS1, and PC. The best-case scenario is to use a game engine (such as Unreal or Unity) that can produce code for whatever platform you need. If it's an indie game that doesn't push the limits of the system, this may be a very simple task. Normally, you can keep a lot of the same code, but you have to adjust it to the capabilities of the systems. You also have to rewrite some code for performance or system-unique features. Now, the architectures for PC, PS4, and Xbox are fairly similar, so it's not a terrible amount of work. However, for each platform you (should) do a lot of testing—which is a lot of work, so many platforms make it very redundant.
It wouldn't add any security, because it would be nothing more than a longer password with some unprintable characters thrown in. It would also raise the problem that if you make a mistake while entering the password, you'll have to start all over again. That makes security less reliable if it's possible that someone is watching you as you enter.
by a system of indexes in connection with a defined file system. The operating system is part of the index and file system, so when, for example, the operator asks for File X, the file system tells the operating system where to look.
Smaller transistors use less power and get hotter. And using smaller transistors means that you can stuff more cores into a CPU or a GPU.
The reason you have a dedicated GPU in a PC is because the cores of a GPU are different from the cores of a normal CPU. They are especially adapted to doing certain calculations that need to be done many thousands of times per second to get your image right, whereas your CPU is made for general computing, which means it needs to have everything at hand. A GPU is like a dragster, made for short high speed. It can't be a city car, making turns, transporting goods, etc. It does its job very, very well, but it's not good for general use. The question why they are separated in a PC is a different question. It comes down to two things. First, it is a matter of consumer choice, the choice to buy a separate CPU and a separate GPU. The second is design. Not every manufacturer of CPUs wants to do GPUs, and not every manufacturer of GPUs wants to do CPUs. It means that they can each optimize their own products. But when it comes to consoles and the Steam Deck, different demands are made. They come with a pre-installed CPU and GPU, and then they have a smaller cooling surface than a normal PC. But it is not the same need for modularity, so they can lose the idea of having a separate CPU and GPU and have a single chip that has both. This optimizes the use of space on the board and cooling, etc.
Pi, to a certain number of digits, is hard-wired into the calculator. When you press the Pi button, the calculator pulls up this stored value.
No. Frames are still generated whether the screen is on or off. The only difference is that the screen isn’t listening when it’s off. You will save some electricity by turning off the screen, but playing on the device locally will be quite a strain on the device. However, if you are streaming to another device, then turn off the screen and do something good for the environment.
Basically, the health care system in the U.S. is quite complicated. Take medicine for example, the cost of which is typically very little related to the real cost of making the drug, and much more to a lot of other things. Let’s say, as an example, that this drug costs $1 to produce in a factory in India. And that the pharmacy pays $2 for it. And then the pharmacy has to pay the pharmacists and the staff, but they do so much work that they’re very efficient, so they can charge $10 for it and still make a small profit. Now, let’s say the pharmacy accepts health insurance plan B. The pharmacy tells the health insurance plan that it needs $10 to break even, but the health insurance plan, which is trying to keep costs down, will only pay 80% of that. The pharmacy starts to lose money, so they say they need $15, and the health insurance company cuts its payment to 66%, but that’s just enough for the pharmacy to break even. Repeat this until the pharmacy charges $100, but the health insurance company only pays out $12. [In reality, things are even more complicated, because the price of the same drug at a pharmacy down the street can be ten times more or less, depending on who you ask. It’s actually a little more complicated, because there’s actually a middleman, a PBM, that’s been the target of many lawsuits.] Then along comes a person who doesn’t have health insurance. The pharmacy, which has sworn in its contract with the health insurance plan that the real cost of the medicine is $100, cannot charge this person less than that without risking getting into trouble. This is where GoodRx comes in. GoodRx has its own contract with the insurance/PBM companies, and can just provide a contract-based discount on the same medicine, so that the patient can get the same price as the person with health insurance plan B. The astonishing thing is that GoodRx doesn’t actually pay for this discount. They simply take a small percentage from what the customer pays. (The pharmacies agree to this because they want to get the customer, and because they have little choice.) What they do is basically make the insurance-based discount available to anyone without health insurance. It’s a wonderful thing that only exists because of the completely skewed nature of the U.S. health care market. Sadly, this kind of thing happens a lot in the U.S. health care system. Hospitals will often charge an enormous amount for something, knowing that the insurance company will only pay a small percentage of it (which is actually much closer to what the hospital needs to break even), but people without health insurance are charged the enormous amount, because the contract says they must. This is where the GoodRx system comes in. GoodRx takes advantage of the way the contracts are set up, so that anyone can get the discount, and it gets paid for this without spending any money.
reverse engineering means: to take a cake and to find out what the recipe for making it was. This is often done with programs, where the program itself is the cake and the recipe is the source code, but, obviously, it is done with all sorts of things.
It’s because heat makes the conductivity change. The semi-conductors behave differently and this is an inevitable fact.
The problem is both. To start with, it’s expensive to set up and operate a chip fabrication plant. Multi-billion, ten-billion-dollar projects are what it takes for a high-tech factory. When the plant is built, it’s generally limited to produce the process that was used in its construction, like the 5nm or 7nm process of TSMC. Generally, the top-of-the-line fabs are used to produce the newest and best quality parts like the CPUs and GPUs. Then older fabs make less important, less valuable components like car or TV chips. Besides, building a new fab takes years, sometimes even a decade. So while a new process is being developed, a new plant is being built. TSMC’s best is the 7nm process. They have a large-scale 5nm process in place, and the 3nm process is in development. So the chip supply is pretty much inelastic, unable to respond quickly to a sudden rise in demand. It’s too expensive to leave idle, and too slow to build to respond to an emergency like the recent outbreak. Besides, the companies don’t want to invest several billion in a new plant, only to see the increased demand return to normal a few years later, well before the plant can even break even. A: Exactly. This time, however, it’s the unexpected ramifications of the outbreak that have played havoc with our normal production and supply chain. In the past year and a half, we’ve seen a very strong surge in the number of personal computers and game consoles sold. And with the pandemic, the fabs have fewer workers. So the demand is very high, and the production capacity is also fully used. Also, other problems have cropped up. There was a drought in Taiwan, for example. Since making chips requires a lot of water, the fabs suffered from a water shortage. And then there was the power outage in Texas. The factories were basically out of action. That was a disaster. The fabs are not designed to suddenly shut down like that, and it took months to repair the damage and resume production.
A digital computer is a small machine that can be given a set of commands. The commands are quite simple: “Put this number in this memory location” or “Add this number to the number in this memory location” or “Follow the program in the memory instead of the next instruction.” The programmers of the very first computers had to devise their programs using these simple commands. We call these programs “assembly code” or “machine language.” A compiler is a program, and the very first compilers were written in assembly language. Some compilers were created using a method called “bootstrapping.” In this method, the programmer wrote the most important parts of the compiler in assembly language, then used the compiler to build a new compiler using the commands of the language the first compiler supported, and so on. (Many compilers are still created this way.)
The hardware is not the same. First of all, the cost of shrinking the hardware to make it fit in a smaller space is significant. And second, the desktop must be far more powerful than your phone. It has to be able to drive multiple large monitors and it has to be able to run all the latest games at a decent frame rate.
SIM cards are not blank or occupied; they are made with the serial number already engraved on the surface. The only thing telecommunications companies do is to connect their billing account and phone number to the serial number of the SIM card. It could be a SIM card that has been used, or a brand new one. Yes, you would like to be on the same network, because T-mobile is not going to assign you to the Verizon network.
The game is either poorly adapted to the console (e.g. bad remakes) or simply badly written and not well-optimized. Each console or pic has some limitations in the code and sometimes the developer either tries to do too much or he does not optimize the code well. Some games are just a combination of both, which is bad. NB: Some consoles are more difficult to program for, which is why the majority of games run poorly on them.
speed reading is simply that, reading quickly. The basic principle behind it is that when most people read, they read at a slow rate of subvocalization. That is the voice in your head when you read something. Speed reading involves suppressing that voice, since it isn’t necessary for comprehension. I know of a site where you can paste text, then set a desired word-per-minute rate and then read the text at that rate. I use this when I want to read lengthy articles.
Why not? It used to be a thing but not much longer. Look at the latest LTT review of the two-GPU i7–4790K.
It's usually the case that the GPU is the bottleneck, not the CPU. The cost of rendering is many times more expensive than the cost of running the game, especially in today's modern large-scale games with high graphic settings. The only big exception is Minecraft, which is completely the opposite, bringing Java (a bad language to make big games) to the limit of its CPU performance, while being very easy to draw on even the most basic GPUs. In any case, it may still be your CPU. Why is the CPU utilization so low? In fact, almost all the CPUs that are on the market today are not one CPU, but a group of two, four, or even eight small CPUs (called "cores") living on a single chip. Each of these small CPUs is almost like a separate CPU. And it's even more than that. In fact, each core of a modern CPU can be divided into two "virtual" cores. So each core can handle the load of two, so if you have a 4-core CPU (which is likely to be the case), then it looks like it has 8 cores. It's a good thing because each of the cores can do their own work at the same time, allowing the computer to multi-thread. And most games are single-threaded. But then, the main part of the game code must run on a single thread, so you have to assign it to a single core. And if that core is fully utilized, you have only used 1/8 of your total potential. So this core is completely full, but the total CPU utilization is only 13%. So that's why the game CPU usage is so low.
It means running a program not on your own machine, but on someone else’s, which means a huge number of other machines in a data center, which is a warehouse full of servers. The cloud (the data center’s management software) knows where to run it and what to do. So you can ignore the details of hardware, and just rent or lease the amount of computing power you need. The information you send and receive from the cloud (usually) goes via the Internet.
The plough. Basically, it’s a general term for applied knowledge—all the human knowledge, discoveries, materials, tools, and methods used in practical ways. What it “means” depends on context and time. Most people might not consider ploughing to be technology, but at one time in history it was.
It's a little like a pseudo-random number. You start with a seed, a number to take as a starting point, and for each step you get a new random number that is determined by the previous number and an operation which distorts it in a way that makes it look independent. Then you start creating world features. Simple examples: if the number at x, y is greater than z, then make a mountain. If your random number ends in 13, make a tree on the mountain. And you tinker with the rules for converting numbers to the world until it's good.
All these terms have very generic or a broad meaning, however; a database is a system or software that is used to store, manage, give access to, and use large amounts of data in an organized, structured and efficient manner. A database can do a lot of things like: enforce a standard, check and rectify the data that comes in or goes out, connect various pieces of data and make it hierarchical, and many other useful things that do not have the effect of one hundred nested folders on your pen drive with the names of “Important stuff” and “Important stuff”. A data warehouse collects data from various sources and past records, analyzes them, performs statistical analysis, predicts trends, classifies them, and does other high-level analysis and finally puts it into useful formats and reports and sends it to the appropriate person. The data lake is the next step if the data is not organized or does not meet the required standards. A data lake is just a business-scaled dropbox where any kind of data, whether organized or not, can be dumped as is into the lake for storage. The organization can reorganize or put the data into some kind of structure later if it wishes. Data Mart: A subset of a data warehouse that is focused on a very specific department, business unit, or set of users. It allows the users to easily retrieve and analyze the data that is directly relevant to their needs and activities without having to shift through or worry about the other data in the warehouse.
First, the programs were made in hardware. You connect the wires in a way that they can achieve the desired goal. The first programmable computer read the program from the rummage. They were written by hand.
I don’t know about WoW, but this is the case for most large-scale projects. They follow the “good coding practices”. They do things in a logical, rational, well-established way so that people who read the code can understand it. This is the first thing that students learn when they start to code. When you write code, you don’t just write for yourself, but also for anyone who might ever read your code. It is very likely that there is some code left from the original version of WoW, which was released in 2004, but the great majority of it has probably changed due to the improved capabilities of the graphic card, etc. It is not very strange. I read somewhere that there was even some code from the very first Windows NT in Windows 10. Microsoft hasn’t said anything about it, but it is logical.
Some games can help you with reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and learning certain skills. Others are just for fun. No activity that makes you happy is a waste of time, so don’t let people bully you for doing what you want in your spare time. Chess and golf aren’t exactly useful either, but no one tries to shame other people for playing them.
it’s already happening. Almost every consumer intel CPU has an integrated GPU. Just look at this, for example, at List of Intel core i5 Processors, where the 11th generation of i5s have the UHD Graphics 730 or UHD Graphics 750 GPUs. AMD calls their part with the GPU for APUs [[Wikipedia: AMD_Accelerated_Processing_Unit][en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Accelerated_Processing_Unit]. The Zen 2 in APUs is Radeon RX Vega-based. The in-built GPUs are slower than the discrete ones for a few reasons. The cooling is shared between the CPU and the GPU instead of being separate. So you have less available power and thus lower performance. The memory used by an in-built GPU is shared with the CPU, which means you have less capacity than with two separate systems. The memory is also optimized for the way the CPUs are using it, not how the GPUs are using it, so even if the GPU doesn’t use any of it the performance is still lower than if it were a separate system even if the CPU isn’t using any of it. The price of a in-built GPU is lower than a separate one, but you sacrifice some performance. As a result of this, the in-built GPUs in modern games with advanced graphics are often too slow. This is fine when playing an older game, which was designed when the performance of the separate GPUs was the same as today. The 386 and 387 together does not make the 486. The separate fpu was external not because of power limitations but because of the limited number of transistors you could have on a single chip for a reasonable price. When that became possible, it was integrated into the 486. The 487SX, which was sold as a co-processor for the 486SX was in fact a complete 486DX with a built-in fpu. The fpu in the 486SX was shut down and everything was done by the 487SX. You can make an external fpu faster than the in-built one. In essence, this is what a GPU is. The manufacturer makes a card for calculating without any display.
We have done it. The roundworm C. elegans has one of the simplest nervous systems in the animal kingdom, with exactly 302 nerve cells, which has been studied to death and the connections between its nerve cells are known exactly. Various scientists have spent decades simulating its brain. Animal brains were simulated later, as large as cats, mice, and rats. Simulating a brain is much more complicated than comparing the number of nerve cells with the number of transistors; what makes the brain work is the wiring of the nerve cells. Even a small mouse brain has a connection density of 1011 even for the simplest connections. We don’t have all these connections, because we would have to cut the mouse brain into a million pieces and study each one under a microscope to find all the connections. We make predictions of the connections between the nerve cells in the simulated mouse brains, but we don’t know whether these predictions are correct. Even in the simulations of the worm, where we know the connections between every nerve cell, we don’t know how they work. If nerve cells A and B are connected to nerve cell C, when does C fire? Perhaps it fires at a rate of ten per cent when A fires, forty per cent when B fires, and eighty per cent when both A and B fire, but these figures are reduced if C has fired in the recent past, except if B has fired many times in the recent past. We don’t know the details, and we don’t know this for every connection. Therefore, the simulated brains are much simpler than the real brains, even though they simulate the same number of nerve cells.
Installing is a transfer of data from point A to point B, and uninstalling is simply telling the system that this place is available and empty. The data is not deleted technically, only next time it can be written to. That's why most recovery tools usually work!
Emulation and Virtualization are similar and the main difference between them is the degree of realism of the implementation. An emulator simulates the hardware a program was created for. When the emulator is loaded, the game is loaded in such a way that the game, when it wants to operate with the hardware, operates with the emulator. Virtualization does almost the same thing but even more so. Virtualization also emulates the boot environment and other elements of a general purpose personal computer. This means that the operating system is loaded and calls to hardware are remapped similarly to the way an emulator is. After the booting of the operating system, the programs that run under it are loaded and they run normally. There are also usually special drivers that allow the virtual operating system to think it is calling lower-level drivers, such as a graphic card. There are also other drivers that map the drives of the host operating system to the virtual operating system, encrypt the network connection of the virtual operating system via the host operating system and map the mouse cursor from the virtual operating system to the host operating system when it is not running full-screen. Thus the emulator and virtualization are similar but virtualization is more extensive and general. The Compatibility Layer is a layer that is supposed to allow an operating system to run the programs of another operating system by implementing the features that the program expects to be available. This is done by studying these features and implementing them in a similar way, using external evidence. A particular API takes Y and Z as input and returns A as a result. This avoids the problem of copyright infringement because the work is original and unique and it does not use the original program in any way. The main advantage of a compatibility layer is that it consumes less resources from the host operating system and can run faster. The main disadvantage is that it can be less stable and does not work with all programs. This layer is gradually created and the goal is rarely achieved.
Whereas most CDs and DVDs store data by means of small pits on the surface, a hard disk has a number of layers of disks that are capable of storing large amounts of data, which are marked with a simple 0 or 1 by magnets, rather than using a pit in the surface of the disk. The heads that read the data are tipped so that they can exchange a 0 or 1 on the disk instead of erasing it. That is why, in the past, you could lose your data by accident or deliberately by bringing your hard disks too close to a powerful magnet. So what about rewritable CDs? They are made of a special material that changes state with heat—from amorphous to crystalline—and that can be influenced as needed by the rays of a reader’s laser. These two states reflect light in different ways, and so the material functions like a pit. When the light reflects in the right way, the material represents a 0 or a 1.
In principle, no difference. C: is the drive on which Windows usually sits. D: can be a physical separate drive, or it can be a partition on the same drive. Sometimes, in machines with two separate drives, you'll find a small, fast drive where the Windows is, and a larger, slower drive where the data is. There is, however, no law that D: should be slower than C:, and with the fact that solid-state drives are increasingly becoming the norm, it's not so much the case anymore. Sometimes it may be advisable to split up a physical drive into several partitions for some reason, even though the partitions are equally fast. In rare cases, if you are particularly unlucky and the program was made by idiots, it can cause problems to be installed anywhere but in the C:: program folder. But if the programmers did their job right, it should not matter where it is as long as there is enough space.
- The essence of communication is in the shaping of ideas and arguments. Ask the teacher or your classmates for better help.
In the case of a hard disk it is a matter of writing to a floppy disk. When there is no space left for writing, that is, no space that has not been overwritten to make it look empty, the memory is “full.” With floppy disks, if there is not enough room to write, that is, no room that can be literally written over to make it look empty, it is “full.” Everything is translated by the computer as one or zero, on or off. The computer looks on the disk, and if it finds a one, it has stored a thing there.
Each improvement is the result of a lot of research and development. And it is not in a single field. Modern semiconductors use the latest developments in material science, chemistry, optics, simulation, testing, CAD, manufacturing, etc. Each of these requires the work of a thousand different specialists. And after the billions spent on basic research that will bear fruit at different times, there are billions more for development. Then there are tens of billions in investment in equipment that is needed in many different companies. A single chip you see as a next-generation chip involves many, many different companies. It is not as simple as saying "skip a few generations"—without the knowledge of previous generations, you can't have the knowledge of the next. You can say the same thing about the road from A to B—simply skip the A and get there from B. It is not sensible, of course.
"Bricking" a computer is a term for something like damage to the device or its own internals, from which there is no way to recover. Erase the underlying system, damage the equipment by overheating, erase the BIOS, remove the RAID volume, etc., etc. So when it comes to Fallout 76, the term is a little misleading. The game is badly compiled and overheats poorly built or cooled systems. To be fair to Fallout, their system was so poorly designed that the crash was inevitable. It has also been reported that the system could not start the operating system and that Windows no longer started, but this is not a real brick. What you have heard from the media is a piece of propaganda for a game that is not well liked. Very, very, very few games cause this kind of problem, because they are not capable of causing such a "bricking"
The physical layer is about the current (or whatever) in the wires and how to use it to transmit information. The data link layer is about how to send information to a few devices on the same LAN (either directly or through switches). The network layer is about how to send information over the wider Internet using advanced routing techniques. The transport layer is about how to send back and forth in packets on a single connection, maybe with some kind of guaranteed delivery (if a packet is lost, resend it etc). The session layer is about how to do something complex with that connection, like authenticate a user. The presentation layer is about how to work with the complex data that is exchanged, like a webpage. How to decode a.jpg image from the received data, or convert character codes into text. The application layer is about how to build something complex like a whole web application.
Remember high school physics? No? Neither do I. But just think about all the physics that goes into a modern 3D game: how far will a projectile fly? How do you know if it collides with something else? How do you calculate the speed of moving water? A game engine does most of this for you, freeing you up to concentrate on the game itself — its content and mechanics, its art, its music, etc. The engine does still need some math, but most of the common problems have been solved for you.
“Grow very fast” means that the problem gets harder out of all proportion to the problem at hand. Here is a run-down, starting with the simplest, on how solving the problem takes longer as it gets harder: Suppose you have a list of numbers, which one is greatest? Doubling the length of the list, a computer will take roughly twice as long to answer the question. Suppose you have a list of numbers, put them in order. Doubling the length of the list will require roughly four times as much time. The process of putting numbers in order is a bit irregular because there are many different ways of doing it, each with their own advantages and disadvantages in different cases. If you have a list of cities and a table of travel times and costs between them, how much does it cost to visit each of them exactly once and then return to your starting point? Doubling the number of cities will roughly double the time it takes to find the answer. To make things worse, if you add just one bit to the problem, the required time to solve it will grow very fast. There is no such thing as an infinite amount of computation power, and there are problems that we have now where even if you made the whole earth one single super-fast computer, the human race would not last long enough to see the result. At that scale, it seems a waste of time even to try to solve them. However, the question of how to change the problem so it can be solved is an important one, as well as if a quantum computer, which uses a different rule from ordinary computers, might be able to. However, there are also problems that simply cannot be solved. The most famous of these is the halting problem: Suppose you have a program, and if you run it, will it stop or continue running indefinitely? Even if it takes 100 quadrillion years, the answer is still “yes, it will stop”. There is no program that can logically and accurately predict this about another program, no matter how powerful a super-computer you use. That is why we say “uncomputable” because it is literally impossible.
A very interesting question. A complete system needs many different silicon chips. A standard PC has a CPU chip, a graphic chip, many DRAM chips on memory modules, and even more chips in the SSD. The total area of all these chips is enormous. Bigger than we can produce today on a single silicon chip. A top-class graphic chip is 650 mm  650 mm, so there's not much space left for the rest. But this is where we are starting to move in the direction of the packaging of the system-on-silicon. We cannot make one giant chip, but we can combine smaller chips into one large package or module. The Ryzen CPU is a good example. It consists of a few small CPU chips and one I/O chip. The speed of the CPU chips requires a high-level fabrication process (and therefore high cost) but the I/O chip does not need to be so fast and can be made on a lower-level fabrication process (and therefore cheaper). There are many ways to combine these smaller silicon chips. You can put them side by side on another silicon wafer with almost atomic-sized wiring to connect them together (this is what Ryzen does) or you can stack them one on top of the other (much more expensive and complex). So to answer your question, the cost of combining all these chips in one package is the main hurdle. It's a leading-edge technology and not many manufacturers can do it.
A modern video game is a kind of collaborative work like a movie, and it takes a movie artist to do it. A writer or a group of writers will write a basic outline, and then an illustrator will draw a storyboard. A producer or a director will adjust the storyboard several times, and the story is almost settled. Then the other artists will appear: one will be responsible for the scene, one for the 3D objects and characters, and one for the sounds. All of these are then made by drawing in 2D or 3D, and the music is written, played, and recorded. The actors will act out their roles and then use the motion capture system to record the movement of the characters and objects. All this is under the direction of the art director. Finally, the editor has to combine everything together. All modern games are programs. The storyboard is a combination of logic and mathematical calculations, which makes the program accept input from various instruments such as gamepads, keyboards, and mice, and interprets it to move and do things in the game. It's simple, such as changing the color of an object, and complex, such as using aerodynamics to determine how an object moves through the air. When the program decides which one is the best, it will appear on the screen.
Basically, the PS3 uses a unique, proprietary architecture that requires significantly more powerful components to emulate. And basically, because it's not a simple system like the PCs we're used to, it's more difficult to emulate. If we had built PCs on a PS3-like architecture instead of what we have now, the code wouldn't be nearly as large or complex.
In multithreading async and multithreading are different concepts. Imagine you own a restaurant. Each employee is a thread, and when you have several employees at once, that's multithreading. Now imagine that your chief cook tells you he needs some supplies, so he rings a delivery service and orders them, saying that when they arrive to ring the bell by the back door. This is a kind of async, a means of delegating work to other employees, in this case the delivery service. All the chief cook has to do is to be notified when the supplies arrive. The big difference between async and multithreading is that with async you delegate the additional work to an external component, and with multithreading to a different thread controlled by your code. If, for example, you send a network request to a remote server, your code doesn't do any of the work itself; that work is done by the remote server, and your code only needs to be notified when the response comes back. Or perhaps you send a length write or read request to the disk controller and then ask it to notify you when it's finished.
Class is the master plan for a human being. Constructor is the detailed instruction manual on how to build the human being. Instance is a duplicate human being.
They depend on the compilers. The compilers translate program code into instructions that the consoles' processors can understand, so a lot of the work goes into that. Things are much easier these days, since most consoles use AMD chips, which are very similar to PCs. But even with the best compilers, it's necessary for programmers to understand the differences between the architectures. It's easier to write for one platform when the consoles' architectures are similar to PCs'. There's still some platform-specific work that has to be done, but far less than before, when the consoles were totally different from PCs.
Turn over your credit card. There's a magnetic stripe, it has your name, card number, security number, and some other things on it. When you swipe it through the card reader, it grabs that information and sends it off to the company to do their thing. The skimmer is basically another card reader that's been installed ahead of the one you're supposed to be using, and that second card reader is under the control of someone else. It's doing the same thing as the one you're supposed to be using, but someone else is capturing the information and using it.
It’s not needed to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. It’s needed to mine them. Previously, they used CPUs, but they couldn’t mine at the same speed as today’s GPUs.
Machine learning is a collective name for all kinds of ML models and algorithms. For example, linear regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. Deep learning is a collective name for a group of "higher-level" learning methods, including deep neural networks, which are neural networks with more than three layers. It is believed that the human brain is a neural network. Basically, neural networks simply weight the input and output and connect them. (Refer to the following figure)
Possibly, but very little. The batteries do not like heat, and as playing is an energetic operation, the battery is bound to be affected a little by the heat. However, I'd be more worried if I left it in the car in the sun. Besides, a tool has been bought, use it. Unless you torture it, a battery should last for a few years. In any case, the batteries will deteriorate. If the battery wears out, and the notebook is still used, then you can buy a replacement for about thirty to sixty dollars.
Does Apple's silicon really outperform the competition?
a lot. Like asking “How do cars get built?”... a lot of industries, tech, suppliers and a production process developed over decades. This is how computers get built. A lot of pieces and lots of ways to screw it up. Start with the mouse? How it works with the wheel and clicks, and how the OS handles that? Even then, there's the whole bus and the message-based system architecture that a modern UI is built on.
Assume that there are 10,000 objects scattered around the map. It's a lot of stuff, so it takes a lot of time to pick up and drop things. Every object needs to be recorded at the location it's at. This is encoded as (X, Y, Z) coordinates, which takes (probably) 8 bytes for each axis, which is (maybe) an item ID and a quantity ID, which comes to (let's say) 32 bytes. One item is about (about) 320 kilobits. That's without any special trickery or compression. This type of data just doesn't take up much space.
Possibly, but that's not the whole reason. A CPU is designed to execute a large number of very basic operations extremely quickly. A graphic processing unit is more specialized, and is made to execute a small number of more specialized operations that are inherently more complex. On each cycle, the CPU does one tiny operation, and the GPU does one large operation. Any data that comes in to a CPU or a GPU takes a path through the device, depending on what it's processing. The path is shorter for simple things, longer for complex things. In extreme cases, as you say, it's the speed of light, which is why things go so fast. But there's another factor: the number of switches the signal has to go through. A switch has an inherent time to switch, or a response time to an input. The time it takes to switch is incredibly short, but on a longer path through more switches, it adds up. The total time it takes for a signal to come in and come out the other end is the total of the travel time between switches plus the total of all the switching time of all the switches it passes through. And this time is longer for the GPU than for the CPU, because it is doing more complex work that takes more time. Now, a digital device can't be clocked faster than the time it takes an input signal to go from one end to the other. Otherwise, the operation will produce the wrong result, errors will occur, and the worst case is that the system crashes, because the system has gotten into an inconsistent and erroneous state. Therefore, the frequency has to be slower than the time it takes a signal to go from one end to the other. Also, power consumption. A GPU already uses a huge amount of power. Increasing the clock speed increases the power consumption and, therefore, the heat it produces, to a considerable degree. As for the frequency of the clocks in CPUs, they haven't changed very much for over ten years, because the most powerful ones were already very close to generating as much heat per unit of surface area as an electric oven on high. And, by the way, the response time of the switches is also affected by temperature. The colder the silicon, the faster the switches respond. This is one of the reasons why overclocking is easier with better cooling. If you lower the temperature, the switches switch faster, the path through the device gets shorter, the limit to the clock speed goes up, and the CPU can go higher before it starts choking on errors and the system crashes.
Besides the number of bits, the most important thing is the number of digits you can make with those bits. With 32bits you can only make a few billion digits. If you gave 32bit IDs to each and every human being, there wouldn't be enough IDs to give every person in the world. 64bits, on the other hand, allow you to make 16 quintillion digits. If you gave a 64bit ID to each and every person, there would be so many IDs that you could give IDs for every second of each person's life.
A digital medium takes pictures and sounds, breaks them up into chunks — in space for pictures and in time for sounds. Then it quantizes this information, quantizes the sound or the color into discrete levels and assigns a number to it. So now you have a string of numbers that represents the picture or the sound. This information is burned into a thin layer of aluminum. Every time the information switches from a 1 to a 0 or back, a pit is etched in the disk. When you go to read the disk, the optical head uses the speed of rotation of the disk and the position of the beam to produce the bits. When the disk comes across a pit, the beam is reflected. This is detected and your string of numbers is reversed internally.
Imagine that your computer is a shop with a warehouse and a stockroom. You are the customer, and the task of the computer is to give you the goods you want as quickly as possible. If the item you want is on the shelf, then the computer can give you it right away. If it is in the basement, the employee must take a slow elevator to get it. The warehouse is the RAM, the warehouse contains many things, you can get them quickly. The stockroom is the hard disk, everything is in there, but you have to take it out each time (the elevator). The clerk is the CPU. If he's faster, he can give you things more quickly, both from the warehouse and from the stockroom. If he has more than one (multi-core), it's even faster, even though they sometimes collide. In order to serve you quickly, you need both a decently fast CPU and a decent amount of RAM.
Often because the code is wrong. Even the most sophisticated projects, like Linux, have bugs (and indeed, complex programs have more bugs, or at least are more vulnerable to bugs). When the code isn't wrong, it can either be that the computer is overloaded (like a 42-km runner trying to do a 50-k run, he'll eventually either stop or slow down) or there's a problem with the hardware, like overheating, a short circuit, interference... people in the industry sometimes joke that cosmic rays are to blame for some bugs, which is uncommon but which could be true. All electrical devices are susceptible to their environment. I remember reading an amusing case here on Reddit of a few cell phones having problems because there was too much helium in the air, which the iPhone (but not other cell phones) didn't like.
It’s efficient. In order to have storage, you need a way to address, that is, to find, a storage space. Since virtually all circuits are based on twos complement logic, each storage space is designated by a twos complement number. Therefore, with each additional digit in the address, the number of locations increases by 2. That is, one digit in the address designates two locations, that is, storage space 0 and 1. Two digits designate four, that is, 0x10, and so on. Thus, any number of digits in the address designates at most 2n locations, which is a power of 2. Also, it’s much easier to design digital circuits if certain bits in the address are fixed, so it’s just more efficient to have storage spaces that are powers of 2. It doesn’t have to be this way, but it’s the one that’s used most often.
I don’t think anyone has quite understood what you mean by “min-max.” By your other comments, I think you’re talking about min-max in the game-theory sense. In this sense, you are trying to minimize your maximum loss. As a general rule, for any particular game and strategy, a certain number of possible outcomes are possible depending on the choices you and the other players make and the luck you encounter. Different strategies have different ranges of outcomes, and these ranges are often referred to as the worst-case scenario (if everything goes wrong, how much you could lose with that strategy) and the best-case scenario (if everything goes right, how much you could win with that strategy). The min-max way of choosing a strategy is to choose the one whose worst-case scenario is the least painful.
Is there some hard drive somewhere on the other side of the planet that stores my files? Yes, that’s basically what it is: instead of storing files on your local hard drive, they’re stored on a server somewhere else. These servers are built with very solid technology, and they can take a lot more strain than your average hard drive at home. They often also make a backup of your files on standby devices, so if the main hard drive fails, they can just redirect you to the backup without losing any data.
A bit, or a bit of information, is either on or off. This information can be stored in many ways: as an electric voltage, as a magnetic field, as dark and light spots on a disk, etc. But no matter how this information is stored physically (see the examples above), we arbitrarily regard one of the ways of storing it as a zero and the other as a one. So 1 bit represents 2 values. 2 bits represent 4 values (00, 01, 10, 11). 3 bits represent 8 values (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111) and so on. In general, n bits have 2n values.
The problem isn't with the power of the hardware, it's with making the 3DS think like the N64/PS1. Each of these systems had a different operation and set of instructions, and emulating means not only receiving those instructions but also translating them into its own native language and then re-executing them. It's like this: You could work as a translator (be the emulator) but first you'd need to learn Spanish (your system's emulators would need to be coded so that it would think like a different system). You can't just mumble something without knowing what you're saying, or you'll upset someone (crash), or just end up sounding like nonsense (the game will crash or be corrupted).
The CPUs do the work normally associated with the CPU, like counting bullet hits and so on. When the GPU has to be used, like rendering, lighting, etc., the CPU sends all the relevant data to the GPU. With the latest XBOX (and the one that will be in the Windows 7 too) the data are now mostly forwarded directly to the GPUs. The advantage of this is that the CPUs are given more resources. In earlier versions of the console, the CPUs had to do most of the decompression of textures and the sending of them to the GPU. This was an unnecessary waste of CPU resources.
The basic idea is that it takes more energy to switch a larger transistor on or off, but a higher rate of switching means a more powerful machine. So, as you shrink the size of the transistor, it takes less and less energy to get the same power density.
Very. For instance, one lithography machine might cost $500,000 and could make 10,000 wafers per month, but a chip needs to go through twenty different steps on that or similar equipment, which means you could make only 500 chips per machine per month. Now, an ST or TI or TSMC can make tens of millions of the smaller microchips in a month, and they’re in everything from cars to microwaves to light switches, but one lithography machine would produce only 500 chips per month. Now the obvious solution is “Get more equipment!” Except the machine-builders themselves need about a year to design, build, and test it, and they too are suffering from a shortage of parts.
With our storage technology, we've come so far. Memory cells are now so small that even a billion of them take up almost no space. Even the memory chips in a large SSD only take up a very small part of the total volume, the rest is occupied by a control and power supply system.
It means that the computer has gotten itself into a situation where it is waiting for something that is never going to happen. Either the computer is waiting properly, doing nothing, while it waits for something, or it is caught in some kind of re-entrant circuit it can’t get out of. Imagine, for example, that you have programmed a robot to walk along a corridor. You tell it that if it meets a block, it must move to the other side of the corridor. What happens if you put two of these robots in front of each other? Well, they both see that they are in the way, so they both move to the other side. And then they see that they are blocking each other’s way, and move back to their original position. And so on and so forth. This is called a “live lock”. The program might contain a loop that is only supposed to be activated if a certain condition is met. But sometimes the condition is impossible to meet, so the program continues to loop indefinitely.
They are. If you loaded the old games you waited for as a kid onto a modern computer, it would go very fast. As our computers have gotten more powerful, we can do more things with them, and that means the code and the graphical representations have become more complex. A lot of the stuff we're using now would take hundreds of years on the old hardware.
The alphabet usually refers to the type of connection. Previously, a single host (an eponymous master) could be used to establish a USB connection. Those hosts are usually equipped with a Type A cable. This is why most of the PC's USB port is Type A. Peripherals, such as printers, are equipped with Type B plugs because they are dependent on the master. Now the new Type-C is trying to unify all of them, but the standard has only been set after a few revisions of the USB. The Type-C can theoretically be faster because it has more wires.
New software needs better hardware. But, given the fixed hardware, at least on laptops, phones and other portables, running newer software, including bug fixes and operating system updates, will just get slower and slower.
There’s no difference between an internal drive and an external drive. The principle that physical access overrides any other protections still holds. The main reason for there being permissions on a drive is so that you can tell the difference between an authorized and an unauthorized person for any particular piece of data. Now, if I plug a drive into my machine, be it internal or external, and allow more than one person to use it, I might want to keep some pieces of information from being seen by person A by person B, and vice versa. Now let’s generalize the concept of “person.” Let’s say the operating system is a person. Each individual user is a person. And if you want to get really technical, each task a given user performs is a person, too. That is, the “you” that’s browsing the web is not the same “you” as the “you” that’s doing your taxes. It’s not uncommon to want to prevent your browsing from affecting your tax records. But one of the problems is that as you move from one machine to another, the person who has ID number 70 on my machine and the person who has ID number 70 on your machine, say, just picking an ID number out of thin air, may not be the same person. For example, if I’m ID number 70 on my machine, that doesn’t necessarily mean that I’m ID number 70 on your machine. If something is restricted so that only ID number 70 can see it, then in practical terms it’s as if that person had changed. Now, one way to make sure the circle of protection doesn’t get broken is to use some kind of encryption, but especially if you can tie the encryption to a specific machine, you can make the circle pretty tight. The entire idea behind the TPM is that it allows the owner of a machine to tighten the circle, perhaps so much so that you’d have to move the entire machine if you wanted to move the drive, and still have it be usefully full of data. This is the essence of the three-layered protection system. First, you protect against the accident. Second, you protect against ill intent. And third, you protect against the machine being compromised so that it can no longer be used at all. Again, this is not so different from the problem of a physical cabinet or safe. A computer is just automating the real world, and if you hand over your safe to someone else, they may be able to access it whether or not you want them to. So one of the goals of security is to make it look like it’s easier to find an easier target. You can think of security as being like the scales on a fish or an alligator. As long as the scales are still in place and still connected to one another, the organism works fine, but as soon as you loosen the connections you can stick a hook into the thing and cause real damage.
. There are innumerable ways of making them. You can multiply by two by turning a wheel with twenty teeth by means of a wheel with ten teeth. Every time you turn the big wheel once, you turn the small wheel twice. You can multiply by any integer. You can divide by simply changing the input and output. Mechanical computers, or digital, are made up of logic gates: and, or, not, xor, nand, etc. An “and” gate emits “1” when its two inputs are “1”; if we set up a pushrod, one inch long, as “1”, then we could devise a mechanism that would only operate if both inputs were turned on. Mechanical computers are usually intended for a particular use. The one you are reading is a general-purpose machine, able to handle a whole variety of calculations. Mechanical ones, on the contrary, are usually specialized. [This is a purely mechanical computer. This device, by entering the density of the block of cheese and the weight desired, mechanically calculates where to cut it. (Link)) It accepts one or more data (digits and logical operators) and a handle to be cranked to perform the calculation.
To the very basic idea, a server is simply a computer. It doesn't need a monitor, nor does it need a Mac or a Windows-like operating system. It just needs a programme and it's capable of storing information, hosting a website, performing a process, or whatever. The only difference is that it's connected to other computers via a network, whether it's local like in your house or remote like on the Internet. But it's still just a plain old computer. A box with memory and the ability to perform a process. It can look however you want as long as it has a CPU and memory. A server can be turned off just like a regular ol' PC. Power off, overheating, spilling water, or hacking. You can make any PC into a server. I've never done it myself, but I've seen friends who do it with their old notebooks just for fun. Apparently it's not that hard.
Reverse engineering is the process of reproducing a product of another manufacturer by a detailed examination of its construction or composition. The basic idea is that you take a product or some kind of object, and you want to make something similar, but you don’t know how it was made. So you basically disassemble it and see how it’s put together.
Well, it’s not just a USB cable. Somehow, they’ve managed to squeeze a tiny, simple micro-computer into the space of the plug. This micro-computer basically has two USB ports. In both directions, it passes the data. But it can also modify it or record it.
If you're talking about Starlink or Iridium, it's probably to determine the number of satellites you can use, or whether you're using the service in a vehicle or at home (in which case it's likely to cost more). A normal modem has no use for the GPS. Maybe it's a way to set the time, but why a modem needs the local time, I don't know. And you can get the world time from the Internet. The modem probably does not have a clear view of the satellite, so it cannot receive a signal. Edit: they might also want to know your location so they can map which areas have good or bad service. It is therefore questionable that the modem is a suitable name for something that has GPS in it. Anyway, in modem's case, I'd be afraid of breaking the GPS myself, and that would be a pity.
A program is a sequence of one or more statements, and zero or more data. @ The statements tell the machine what to do, and they can use the data or create more. For a simple program, you don't have to think too much about how to organize those statements and data. However, for complex programs, it's easier to create, test, and maintain the program using a model like object-oriented. The four key concepts of object-oriented are: o Abstraction. o Encapsulation. o Inheritance. o Polymorphism. Let's start with abstraction. Abstraction is basically a way of hiding information. You already know this in daily life. You may drive a car every day, but you don't have to know how the car works. You just have to know the basic controls of the car, such as brake, throttle, and steering. You can use these controls to drive almost any car, even if you've never seen it before. Object-oriented works in the same way. You can define the behavior of a part of the program using an interface, and as long as someone else knows the interface, they don't have to know the details. For example, I wrote a program that takes a list of numbers and sorts them in order. You can use this program even if you don't know how I made it work and you can't see the code, just because I said that it's a sort function. You give him a random list, and he gives you a sorted list. That's what abstraction means. The next key concept is encapsulation. The idea is that the various parts of a program are objects. For example, I'm making a drawing program, and one thing you want to draw is a circle. I will need a lot of circles. It would be convenient if I had a way to reuse the circles. One way to do this is to create a part of the program that can store the common data of the circle, such as radius, center, color, etc. And he may want to access that circle's data, such as the color, or the operation to change the color, such as a command that draws the circle. So I can combine the data and operations into an object called a circle. It's like a combination of a tuple and a variable. And I put the statement that draws the circle into the circle. This is what I often call a class. But the circle is a class that the other person can use without knowing the details of my code. The third concept is inheritance. I already have a circle class, so let's make a square class. Squares have some common properties with circles. For example, they have color. They also need to be able to draw themselves. But there are also differences. A square has no predetermined radius. How can I reuse the common data, but keep the different data? It is possible to reuse it by inheriting it from a circle. You can make a class called a shape. In the shape, you will store the data and operations that all shapes have in common, such as color and draw. And when you make the circle, you can inherit from the shape. It is no longer necessary to write the statement that can store and retrieve a color, but just inherit the shape. The circle is a shape. But the square is not a circle. This makes it easier to organize the code, and I don't have to repeat the code many times. It's easier to think about the program. If you make a change to the program (you might be fixing a bug or adding a feature), you only have to make a change in one place, so you don't have to forget it. The fourth concept is polymorphism. It's a bit tricky. Polymorphism is a way to change the behavior of a function. It comes in two ways. The first is called overloading. I made a statement called add, which adds two values to the end of the list. But it may be added in a different way depending on the value of the two. I will use the add statement in this way. If I use the add statement to add two values, I will overload the add statement, and I will define three functions, and they are all called add. The first function takes two values and adds them to the result. If you give it a 7, 4, it will return an 11. The second is a function called add, which takes two words and makes a word longer than the word. If you give it a cat and a dog, it will return a cat-dog. The third is a function called combine, which takes two colors and mixes them into a new color. If you give it a blue and a yellow, it will return a green. This is useful because it is possible to use the same function without knowing the data in advance. The second change of behavior is called overriding. In the shape class, I defined a statement called draw. If I want the circle to be able to draw itself, I'll make a statement called draw inside the circle. But although the circle is a shape, it will use the draw statement of the circle instead of the draw statement of the shape. This is useful because it can change the behavior of an object, and I can't cover everything here. I would like to know if it is useful. I was able to do it because the four concepts of object-oriented are basically as follows. Abstraction. Encapsulation. Inheritance. Polymorphism.
Many. The exact number depends on the exact location of the destination server and how far away it is. A typical route might look like this: Your home gateway, your modem, your ISP's CMT, your ISP's Ethernet switches, the NSA tap, your ISP's edge routers, your ISP's edge switches, handoff to other ISPs, more fiber switches, remote datacenter routers, remote datacenter switches, a remote firewall, a remote web application firewall, load balancers, frontend web servers, more switches, load balancers, and then a database server.
You have four questions in there. How does the program exist on the hardware? We discovered a way of storing the electrical state of the system. Then we gave those states meaning. That's the program. It has to exist on the hardware. We have a number of abstractions from human-written programs. First, there is the machine language, which is a purely abstract "on" or "off" of an electrical circuit. Then the abstraction is made to the assembly language, which is human comprehensible to a certain extent. Then there is the abstraction to the high-level language, which the programmer writes in. When the program is compiled, it goes back down the ladder and executes what the programmer wrote. Why did we only discover that in the last eighty years? Because before then, we had no means of controlling electrical currents. That was changed by the discovery that you could control them with the use of valves. Why were the first computers so large? Because of the valves. They were large, and if each bit of memory was the size of a light bulb, there was no question of making them small. How did they get smaller? They were made without valves. Now we control the electrical current with the help of the transistor. We have managed to make the transistor very small. Thus, we can pack billions of them on a tiny chip.
The sound is converted into a digital, uncompressed stream, which has only two properties: amplitude and time. Depending on the desired effect, the stream is manipulated mathematically. Amps multiply. A reverb just adds the current value to upcoming values, etc. Some freeware let you add your own effects from scratch.
A lock has several pins cut at different lengths. The master key has been designed so that the lengths of the pins are matched to those of the master key. So that when the master key is inserted, all the pins line up. That allows the cylinder to turn freely since there are no pins to stop it—they are all pulled back to the inner side of the cylinder. The master key will only fit the lock if it fits the key, so it is known as a'master-keyed lock.' It means that as the cylinder turns, the pins rise up at different heights, causing the lock to unlock. [Master-key lock (see example)]
Everything is stored in different ways. There are tapes and old hard drives that store data in magnetic fields. These fields weaken with time, and it is very difficult to separate them from the magnetic fields generated by other equipment or even by the universe itself. Data is stored on the medium for a long time, the more likely that the magnetic field has become so weak that some of the information has been lost. Other media use physical properties, such as CD-ROMs (not CD-Rs, I'll talk about them later), but even though they're made of durable plastic, they're not eternal. In the course of time, the material of the disk deteriorates and makes it impossible to read the data on it. There are media that use chemical properties, such as CD-Rs and CD-RWs, which last a long time but are not eternal. Some media, such as flash memory, combine all these properties, but then they also decay physically or are affected by strange random cosmic phenomena, and they can also be lost. So the only way to store data for eternity is to periodically copy it to new media and check it for a copy. The more copies you have, the more likely it is that you will not lose it. This is also true for analog data like film. Time is mostly responsible for degenerating everything in some way.
They are written in regular languages and compiled like any other program. Since operating systems are required to have a very close relationship with the hardware, they are usually written in low-level languages such as C, but this is not necessarily so. At first, they were hand-written in machine language (the language that the CPU "understands"), but this is not necessarily so. As can be seen from the above, it is horrendous to work with, and therefore the creation of higher-level languages and compilers (from high-level language to machine language) was one of the first things we did.
A gun at the back of the box fires a beam of particles in the direction of the audience. This beam would naturally hit the screen somewhere in the middle and make a picture on it that would be rather boring. It only works if the beam has no air obstacles in front of it, so the interior of the tv needs to be a vacuum. This makes the tv quite heavy, since it has to be strong enough to resist the air pressure that wants to break it on all sides. The beam of particles is directed by a system of magnets so that it can be directed in various directions. This allows the beam to point anywhere on the screen. Because it can only be bent a certain amount, the gun and magnets have to be fairly far behind the screen, and that's why the tv is nearly as deep as it is wide. Then you have a big box with a wall thick enough to contain a vacuum. It must therefore be heavy. Moreover, the walls must not be conductive, which makes them even heavier, since they must be made of a less strong material. So far we have a beam of particles that is directed at various parts of a glass screen. Not too useful yet. The glass is therefore provided with a coating of phosphor, which glows if it is hit by these flying particles. So we have a beam of particles that can make lines and curves on the screen. Now the magnets sweep the beam over the individual pixels in the screen, row by row. As it hits a pixel, the beam is made stronger or weaker by the gun, and the phosphor glows brighter or darker as a result. So you get a picture that is scanned on the whole screen and where the beam is modulated to form a picture. Color screens are made with different phosphors and, through various clever tricks, one of them is lit up.
Imagine a piece of paper. You can write as many words on it as you want, but you can't write over another. You'll run out of space eventually. A hard-drive is the same. Everything you store is represented by a series of ones and zeroes. There's only so much space in the memory to store all these numbers.
A pointer in a program stores the memory address of a block of data. It is useful if you have a large amount of data that you do not want to copy around your program but would rather tell your functions where to find the data. C and C++ also allow pointers to be indexed, which means you can change the memory address by adding the size of the data type to it. It is very useful because most programmers are familiar with array notation, which makes it easy to organize and manage large amounts of data.
Anyone can invent a system of their own. A: First number: major update. This number would be increased if the entire program was almost rewritten from scratch, or the whole design of the program was changed, etc. A second number: minor update. This is an update to the program's features, which adds new features or changes the way a part of the program works. A third number: bugfix. This is a bug fix or some other changes. A fourth number (if there is one): build. Usually not used in the public releases, it is just the number of times the current version has been compiled. But if a fourth number is seen, for example if the last update was incorrect and had to be repaired immediately, it can be used as a build number or replaced by a.1 or.2 But almost all the companies do something else, because it is just a fantasy.
Many games have a hard-coded limit on fps, such as 30fps, regardless of the hardware they’re running on. This prevents the fps from jumping around as the complexity of the scene changes—as you turn your head around, for example. But newer hardware can run at 60 fps without breaking a sweat, so when you upgrade from PS4 to PS5, the hard-coded limit of 30fps is no longer necessary.
Just like the general population, there are Amish who are very strict and those who are not so strict. The rules are mostly set by the churches, but Mennonites understand that not everyone in their fellowship will adhere strictly to the letter of the rules. The Schwartzentruber Amish are what most people think of when you say "Amish." They are very strict, living in a house built in the old way, without electricity. The Schwartzentruber Mennonites are a small group of Mennonites, but they are the 'poster children' for all Mennonite groups. While the less strict Amish and Mennonites have more modern homes, they are still very religious, they have a dress code, they send their children to Christian schools, they have normal jobs, they may have a cell phone, but they also restrict the use of the Internet, cable TV, etc. There are also groups in between. Some of the schools have electricity, but it's solar and off the grid. In general, it is not a question of technology, but more of independence.
No, not everyone knows about building PCs. I suspect your stale experience is blinding you to the truth. Frankly, it's no wonder that it's a popular hobby in some respects because it's very easy — the modular design makes it an IKEA of electronics. I think the question is not why so many people can do it, but why so many people don't do it - especially with the popularity of prefabricated and similar products.
Take a look in your task manager and see how many services are running. Nearly all of them start up either when the system boots up or when you log in. Or take a look at a program that starts when you log in. For example, Steam is a game client that has its own web browser and many other features. When it starts up, the operating system has to load the executable file to memory and then run it. When Steam starts running, it needs to know on what system it is running, it does this by reading the environment variable files, then it has to load its many libraries and settings from the disk so it can run properly. Most of Steam's work here is loading, if you have a hard drive you may hear it stuttering and struggling to read from it. You have to understand that the hard disk can only read one thing at a time and since it is much slower than the CPU, the other programs will wait for their files to be read. The real slowdown occurs when you, the user, are trying to load something, like a web browser. This will be placed in the queue of the hard disk, where it has to wait for several other programs to get their files before it can be loaded, and then it may enter into a similar sequence as the one that has just run, and this will eat up even more time. First of all, if you boot up your operating system, it will always try to start up in the same state as the previous time it was started. There are exceptions to this, for example in Windows, when the system shuts down, some processes are purposely not finished, in order to speed up booting time by skipping some initialization (how it does this and what it does is not entirely clear).
Every language is gradually developing in two ways: abstraction and specialization. At the beginning of the story, the computer was a pretty stupid machine that could only handle simple logic and mathematics. The “program” was a series of basic instructions that were used to do useful things like calculating logarithms. But what was really useful about this program was that it could be copied. Instead of writing your own instructions to calculate a logarithm, you could just use the ones someone else had already written. Now nobody writes instructions to calculate a logarithm themselves (except for programming exercises). In the modern language you just have to write something like “log(x)” and the language itself does the rest. As the list of things that a computer can do grows, new ideas also arise about how to organize and implement it all. This is gradually incorporated in new languages or major updates to old ones. The other disadvantage of using someone else's code is that it is sometimes less efficient than a program that has been written from scratch to optimize for your particular application. But with the growing power of the machine, there are fewer and fewer applications that have this disadvantage. Modern languages are therefore much more abstract (and in general easier to use) than old ones like C and basic. The other development direction is specialization. A person who works with data and statistics may use tools like SQL, R or SAS. A person who builds a web page may use HTML and PHP. These languages or tools have their own built-in tools that make it easier to do certain things. You could perhaps make a web page with R or a database with HTML, but it would be an extremely complicated job. Other languages, such as Python and Ruby, are much more general and, with the right extensions, can also be used to do many specialized things. But a person whose job is only about one area of specialization often does not see the point in finding and learning these extensions compared to using a specialized language.
First, they reduce the processing that they have to do on their end. You move the mouse, the character’s arm moves. You press the fire button. The gun fires a shot. The bullet flies toward another player. The game figures out if you hit him and inflicts damage on the other player. The server has no interest in the graphic side of things. It leaves all that processing to your local system. All it has to do is know the player’s position (three numbers) and the direction and speed of the bullet (two numbers). It performs a fairly simple mathematical calculation and sends the result back. Most of the resource-hungry calculations are graphically based. If your local system can’t handle the graphic calculations, then you’re in trouble. But if it’s not the server’s fault, it’s the player’s fault, because they don’t have a way of avoiding sending information. Second, they have enough servers to be able to handle the incoming information, process it quickly enough, and send it back to the player. Third, they don’t really care if you get a quick reply. The network protocol they use is a “fire and forget” system. You send information to the servers, but you don’t wait for a reply. That’s why network lag is characterized by players suddenly jumping around or becoming frozen in place. Your local system keeps processing your commands and rendering the graphic results, but it doesn’t get any information about what the other players are doing. For minor lags, you don’t even notice and the game just continues as if nothing were wrong.
There are memory cards with 400 gigabytes. But for most solid-state memory, the answer is that the underlying chip is made so as not to waste material: every byte of memory needs to be addressed for reading and writing, and so chips have very, very thin wires called address lines that choose which cell to read or write from. You need 10 address lines to address 1000 bytes, the thousandth byte would be then designated by a sequence of ten ones: 1111110111 (=999). As you see, there are two zeros in there. In fact, if you have to use ten lines anyway, it's useful to use all of the address space they provide, which is 1024 bytes. Each address line adds a power-of-2 increment to the address space, so it makes sense to use up the entire address space with memory cells. This is an extremely simplified description of how the electronics work inside memory chips, but it gives you an idea.
Aha, this is what they ask me when they have the task “Don’t Speak” in a drinking game. Monads are containers for values. You can have a value, no value, or many values, it doesn't matter. You have a box for values and this box adds an additional context to values. This context is specific to the implementation of the box. Now not every box is a monad. An easier box to start with is a functor: it is a box that provides functionality to transform values in the box without changing the box itself and the context. The context does not change, the value does. Let's take two common examples: option and list (I'll use some weird Java-like pseudocode because it doesn't matter). Now an option has a value of type T or it doesn't. That's the whole joke. The context of the box is that the value in the box is potentially not there. A scherö-höhoer-value. It's most similar to a nullable value, but with type safety and some cooler features. Imagine a typical code of null values: var foo: T?, var bar: U?,... If the value is there, you do something with it, if not, return nothing. Here's where the option shines. A functor is a box BoxA with a method map, which takes a function A->B and returns a box B. It basically applies the given function to values in the box without changing the box. This means that, in the case of the option, the value in the box can be transformed by the function. Otherwise, it remains missing. Now, in the case of the option, the context is not there implicitly without having to import it. Var foo: T?, Var bar: U?,... It gets much nicer. It is also more type-safe than the previous example with the null value because it explicitly needs to handle the case of no value before it can be used as a value. Similar for lists: You know a list. A list wraps a bunch of values and puts them in a certain order. The context of the list is the order of the values. (A set would be the context that the values are unique.) This is the classic: var foo: ListT>, var bar: ListUB>,... Now imagine a lot of transformations. A lot of loops, maybe you use the index directly. It gets pretty ugly pretty fast. But what you actually do is apply the quoz function to all the values in the foo, and that's all. So why not just write: var foo: ListA,... return foo.map(quoz), and done. This way you keep the order and size of the context and all the values are transformed. This is a functor. But what about monads? You see, besides a lot of mathematical details that don't really matter in practice, functors have a big problem: functors are general, they don't do anything with the context of the box, so there is no way to extract this nested option. A nested option doesn't make sense, because the difference between an option with no value and an option with no value in the inner option is not there. So what about this? What if you need an inner box that is an option? This doesn't work anymore. This kind of logic is specific to the implementation of the box and the context. You can compose different functors because they are independent of the context. But you can't compose different monads because they are dependent on the context. Monads are boxes with a method bind or flatmap, which takes a function A->B and returns a box B. Compare this with map, which would return a box BoxB>. Monads are responsible for combining nested boxes into a single box. This is not as easy as it sounds for an option because if either the inner box or the outer box is empty, the resulting option is empty. There are a lot of different ways to combine nested lists into a single list, but the most common implementation is just concatenating all the inner lists. Then you just iterate over all the inner lists and copy their elements into a new list and return that. Otherwise, the value of the inner list is used. This explanation skips a lot of theory and detail (and mathematicians and Haskell freaks will kill me after this answer), but I hope you understand the basic concept: Combining boxes.
Machine learning is a special case of artificial intelligence, yes. You can write a program to do a task, test it on that task, and then change its settings according to the results. If you do this a thousand times, you’ll get the settings right and the program will work fine. It will “learn” the task. The programmer may not know how the final settings work, but that’s fine. They just work.
digitally. This means that the information is in the form of 1s and 0s, and it needs a brain somewhere to translate those into a song or a DVD with both music and picture. The laser is looking at the surface of the disc. There are parts of the surface that are shiny, so the laser bounces off them. Other parts of the surface aren't shiny and don't bounce off the laser. That's the difference between your 1 and 0.
A git repository is a folder and everything in that folder is part of the repository. Git keeps track of what's in those files and what files are there, so it can know when a file is added, removed, or even changed. To update the repository with changes you've made, you tell git: "these are the changes I want to make to the repository," and then you "stage" the changes. Then you can do a git commit, which is basically a description of what you've done, saying you commit to making these changes. And then you can "push" your commit to the repository. Someone else might want to have the changes you've made, so they can "pull" the changes you've "pushed" to the repository. In this way, you can keep your local copy up to date with the latest changes that have been made.
More complex games with more layers, so more opportunity for bugs. But the biggest difference is the ability to patch them after release. Before, you got the game on a physical medium and that was it. A major bug could ruin a game and it couldn't be fixed. Now, a major bug may still have an impact on initial sales, but it isn't as critical.
You pressed a button on a machine resembling a typewriter, which was connected to one of the 26 inputs on a wheel, which was then connected to one of the 26 outputs. The position of the inputs and outputs was random. The output of one wheel went to the input of another wheel, which changed the positions of the inputs and outputs again. The same thing happened with a third wheel, and so on. Then the signal went to a control panel that had a socket for every letter of the alphabet. For 10 of the letters, there was a connecting wire. For example, if the wire connected the letter A and the letter T, and the wheel had sent the signal to the letter A, the control panel changed it to the letter T. Despite the fact that it is a totally deterministic process, it is so complex that it is hard to find out what the input letter was from the output letter. Also, the action of pressing the button causes the wheels to turn, which changes the order of the letters. If you pressed the same letter twice, the result would be two different outputs, with no mathematical relationship between them. But if you knew the settings of the machine—that is, which three wheels to use and in what order to start—you could decipher any message. Each soldier was given a code book with the initial settings for that day. New settings were sent to the soldier safely with every message. It was hard to break because the possible combinations were so many that it was impossible to brute force them. By the time you did, the message would be outdated.
I’m not sure. The hardware features of, at least, the Apple products are quite stable and there are no recalls of the product yet. That is not true of other product lines. We can see that a car produced a few months after another of the same brand can differ in some respects. Even with much more strict product specifications, a change in suppliers or a bad batch of the same suppliers can change the quality or performance of the final product. That is why we often hear about recalls of products manufactured in months X and X, even though the product has not changed in several years.
Bootcamp lets you install Windows on a Mac along with MacOS. This only works on Intel-based Macs because the Macs are based on that architecture. However, for the moment, Microsoft does not offer a version of Windows for the M1 chip. Pro: The operating system is installed natively on the hardware and can therefore take full advantage of it. Con: You can only run one operating system at a time, so you have to start up again to switch between operating systems. Parallels Desktop is virtualization software. It creates a second virtual computer on your Mac in which you can install and run another operating system, such as Windows. Pro: You can easily switch from MacOS to Windows without having to start up again. Con: Since it is virtualization, the performance can be somewhat limited. So if you want the bootcamp experience with parallels, just start up again every time you want to run windows in parallels. I don't know why you would do that, but it's your business. It will still be virtualized because Windows cannot run natively on the M1 chip, so the performance will still be limited. CrossOver is a completely different piece of software. It is a compatibility layer that enables non-windows operating systems to run windows applications. It basically emulates all the functions of the operating system that the Windows application expects from the operating system to draw its GUI, read files, access hardware, network and more. You can do pretty much the same things in different operating systems, but you have to use different procedures to communicate with them. CrossOver is between the application and the operating system and translates the Windows function calls to the operating system into something that the underlying operating system can understand and execute. It is important to understand that such emulation is not perfect because it tries to replicate exactly all the functionality of an operating system, without having access to the source code.
Imagine a computer as a restaurant. The CPU is the chief cook. The chief cook can prepare any dish with the speed of light. But chief cooks are expensive, so the restaurant only has one chief cook and a few sous chefs (CPU cores). They’re very good at preparing one or two special dishes very well, but they’re slow when there’s a lot of work. The GPU is the kitchen staff. They are slower, but there are many more of them. They need a very specific instruction for each dish, but once they learn the recipe, they can produce huge quantities—enough to feed a wedding. A GPU requires specific code, not just regular code, and often has to be different from normal code to be efficient at running lots of similar and parallel tasks. The RAM is the kitchen counter. The more counter space the better—the kitchen staff doesn’t have to run back and forth to the storage cupboard (hard drive) to get the next ingredient.
(From an earlier question) Bit width is like the amount of people in a car. It is one aspect of performance (how many people are coming or going at once), and there are many other ways to make a machine go faster—just as you could build more direct roads, faster cars, or build more lanes, or do better traffic management. In a sense, the bit width tells you a little bit about precision or length of a particular calculation, but it does not tell you much about the system’s performance. One of the main things that the bit width of the CPU affects is how much memory it can address directly. More addressable memory means that the program can be bigger and run faster (because more of it can be kept in memory instead of on disk) and more of them can be run at the same time.
It is very simple. You write your letter in an envelope and give it to the postman. The postman puts the envelope in a box and gives it to the distributor. The distributor puts it in a box and puts it on a truck. The truck goes from one distributor to another. The distributor on the other side opens the box and takes out the box and gives it to the postman. The postman takes the envelope out of the box and gives it to the receiver. The receiver opens the envelope and reads the letter. Attacks could be like a stranger receiving the packet at any point (a man in the middle attack). The postman delivering a lot of packets at once (DDoS attack). The receiver stealing the packet (unauthorized access).
Song copyright is over the words and notes. Recording copyright is only over the individual recording. So if she owns the songs but not the recordings, she can record them herself and own the whole thing.
First we'll talk about the CPU. The CPU contains a whole bunch of 64-bit registers (hence 64-bit). Each register has a particular function, but we'll concentrate on the SP register, also known as the'stack pointer'. The CPU also contains a special device called the oscillator (also known as the clock), which is set in vibration, and it makes the volts flicker at a rate of billions per second (GHz). When the volts flicker, this causes a series of volts to be generated in certain places in the CPU. Which volts are generated in which places depends on the voltages in the certain parts of the memory through the SP register. If all the switches in the SP are 0, then the memory addresses are the first 8 bits (the first byte) of the memory, if the last switch is 1, then it's the second byte, and so on. But the register itself also depends on the memory, so that with each ring of the clock it points to a new byte. Now go back to the human who is typing on the keyboard. The compiler (the program) translates these words into machine language (voltages) that are plugged into the memory. When the program starts, the SP register points to the first byte of the compiled code and carries on.
A few things. Older operating systems had a size limit on their file system. To use a big hard drive, you had to break it up into smaller partitions. Secondly, as someone else said, it's to optimize your file system. The operating system stores files in pieces called blocks and clusters. In older operating systems—and perhaps some newer ones—a file is spread over a large number of blocks. If the file didn't fill the "last" block completely, you couldn't use the space in that block for anything else. Let's say the operating system allocates a file system to use 1-kilobyte blocks and your file is 4,100 bytes. It will take five blocks to store the file. In the last block, only 0.01 kilobyte is used. The remaining 0.90 kilobytes are lost. When you divide your hard drive into several partitions, you can set each partition to use different block and cluster sizes. The size of a file you're likely to save on a particular partition will help you choose the most efficient block size. The idea is to use the fewest number of blocks per file—because it speeds up the read/write process—while avoiding wasted space in the "last" block of each file. If you're likely to fill up a partition with files that are mostly a few megabytes long, you can choose a smaller block size. If you're likely to store image files of 50 to 200 megabytes, you'd want to use a larger block size.
The vast majority of computations done by a CPU do not include any error correction (at least in a standard commercial CPU). Error correction is mostly limited to memory arrays and data communications. In the actual logic blocks of the CPU, there is almost no error correction. This is because errors are extremely rare. The logic blocks are usually quite reliable. But some things can make them go haywire—electromagnetic interference, voltage hiccups, crosstalk, etc. I can’t give you a precise figure for the rate of errors. There are many variables. But it’s somewhere between 1 in 106 and 1 in 109 device-hours. (In general, soft errors are at the 109 end of the scale.) But they do occur. Some errors are completely harmless; some cause the program or operating system to crash; and some produce a subtle, hidden error in the calculation. That last one, called “transparent data corruption,” is actually the worst kind in many ways. Nobody wants to rely on a CPU to do a crucial calculation if the calculation could be wrong without any sign of error. It could be very, very bad in a worst-case scenario.

The basic definition of a game engine is “what’s left of the game when you take the game out of the game.” When you look at the screen and see a dragon—that’s the game. The rest of it is the secret machinery that makes everything work. That is, someone has to draw a dragon and put it into the game. But what about the program that turns the dragon’s drawing into the three-dimensional image on the screen? That’s the engine. So the engine is actually the vast majority of the program. So it’s not surprising that it affects everything. Yes, every engine has its limits. For example, the original Doom was made for DOS-era machines, back in the day, in the mid-nineteen-nineties. It was written for maximum speed, and that means it has to do things in a certain way, with certain limitations. For example, you can’t look up or down in Doom. And the monsters aren’t even three-dimensional. That’s what they had to sacrifice to get the game running. There are times when fundamental design decisions have to be made. For example, Factorio has a multiplayer mode. There’s a lot of stuff going on in a Factorio game, so it would be laggy if the server kept telling everyone what was happening around them. But if everyone’s computer was running the whole game, then it would get out of sync. So random events are out of the question. And even what looks random isn’t really random. It also means that every time someone logs in, they have to wait while their copy of the game world gets transferred to their computer. And if anyone’s machine is too slow to run the game normally, everyone’s game will run more slowly, or the person will be kicked out. And it’s only possible to have either lag-free, lag-free multiplayer or playable by people with slow machines—not both. To change that requires rewriting the whole multiplayer system from scratch. So if you ask someone who’s made a game to avoid lag, how can you play it without lagging everyone else’s game, the answer is that you can’t. It’s not that it’s impossible; it’s just that it’s impossible in the way the engine is designed for fast multiplayer. To change it would mean that it was no longer the same multiplayer engine.
as in decimal, but you flip over your digits at 2 instead of 10: 0 is 0, 1 is 1, 2 is 2. 3 is 11. First digit on the right is 1? Add one. Second digit on the right is 2? Add two. Third digit on the right is 3? Add four. By and by you’ll have added up the whole number and have calculated its decimal value.
The microprocessors are not inserted, but etched. You might imagine a machine that solders millions of tiny transistors to a chip, but that’s not how it’s done. Those billions of transistors are etched on the surface of a piece of silicon with a petrochemical solution and microscopic “stencils,” which are used to etch the circuit and turn a certain part of the surface into a real working IC. You could possibly damage the transistors during the handling of a naked chip, but chips are hardly ever shipped naked. They are always sealed inside protective materials, like an epoxy. So the only thing that could damage the transistors are penetrating rays.
Yes. The first six digits of the card number are the IIN (issuer ID number). Cards with the first two digits – 4 or 5 – are issued by banks and financial institutions. You can use this number to trace the issuing bank. Here is the corresponding information on the English wikipedia:
No, unless there is some new network of satellites I am not aware of. The satellites are simply there broadcasting, and devices receive the signal and time the signal to figure out their position. They don't need much bandwidth because they're sending the same simple message to everyone. In contrast, the satellites that provide telephone service and data service are very limited, with a relatively small number of subscribers, so they don't need to allocate vast amounts of bandwith.
It’s not just the speed of the clock, in GHz. There’s more to a newer processor than just the speed of its clock. Suppose it’s arithmetic and every CPU is 1 tick per second, which means it can only do 1 operation per second. So, to add 1 + 2  3, a hypothetical calculation on a 1 tick-1 operation-per-second clock, it might roughly do: Tick 1: store the first number in the memory and convert it into an m1 variable; Tick 2: store the second number in the memory and convert it into a m2 variable; Tick 3: add m1 and m2 and store the result in a memory location; Now that is a very simplified example but let’s assume that it takes 4 seconds or 4 ticks to complete. If an instruction is inserted that already knows the result, 1 + 2 = 3, then it uses that instruction and does it in one or two ticks. A newer CPU that has that instruction coded into it, can do the same operation in less ticks. That’s why it’s not just about GHz. Above is not a precise explanation but it’s a simple attempt to explain why a newer CPU can do the same operation in less ticks.
That would be a problem, unless you misstated and meant 477 GB, which would be understandable. The reason is that there are two different definitions of the words kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte, etc., and these definitions compete with each other. When the first computers began to work with thousands of bytes, the engineers needed a shorthand way of writing these numbers. A problem was that the memory of the computers, etc., was divided into powers of two, and our normal ways of describing numbers are divided into tens or hundreds (rarely, if we use dozens). For the computer, a kilobyte is a perfectly round number, but if you say kilo, you mean thousands, not millions. So they devised a ruse: 2 to the tenth power is 1024, and 1024 is close enough to 1,000 that they simply adopted the metric prefixes, and declared that a kilobyte is actually 1024 bytes, not 1,000. In this way, they could use small numbers and not lose any precision. This made 65536 into exactly 64 kilobytes. This went on for a while as the computers got bigger, and the megabyte, gigabyte, etc., was defined in the same way, each successive step 1024 larger than the previous one, instead of 1,000 larger. It worked, but it caused a ruckus with the people in charge of the metric system. They had created the kilometer, kilogram, kilowatt, kilovolt, kilohertz, and all the others, and they always meant 1,000 of whatever it was. Having the kilobyte mean 1024 instead of 1,000 outraged them. So they decided that the engineers would have to use a different word if they meant anything other than a power of 1,000, and they suggested kibibyte for 1024 and kilobyte for 1,000, as it should be. They weren’t listened to at first, but they were the ones who made the laws. Some clever marketeers at some point realized that they could exploit this confusion and put more space on their products, simply by adding an asterisk and a tiny note saying that they weren’t using the metric system definitions. But the only reason they’re using that definition is because some of the same companies that sell disks with this power of 1,000 definition also sell memory with the power of 1024 definition. They just use whichever one is more convenient. A 512 gigabytes, according to the metric people, is a 477 gigabytes, according to the old one. And that’s what it will say on your computer: 512 GB. If it says 377 GB, then there’s something else going on, such as a hidden partition or a problem with the hardware.
There are some states where cargo vans are taxed less than private cars. The idea is that people who need a van to transport their tools for their work shouldn't be taxed as much as people who just want a big car for comfort. And for tax purposes, a cargo van is usually a two-seater with a minimum size cargo area. So if you take out the back seat and put up a partition wall behind the front seats, the car fits the definition of a cargo van, and therefore is exempt from taxes.
The file is written to whatever medium is being used by the device. For desktops this might be an SSD drive, which uses flash memory to save memory, which is essentially the storage of electrical charges. Or it could be a hard drive, which is a collection of spinning magnetic disks, and their magnetic field is read as data. When you “delete” a file, it’s not actually deleted. At the location where the file is saved there’s a bit that shows whether or not that space in memory is in use. When you “delete” a file, that space is marked as in use. Then sometime (who knows when) your computer writes something new to the space, overwriting the old file. This is why hard drives and SSDs can be recovered for legal proceedings.
There are many ways of modulating a carrier with data. Let's take your 2,400 mHz AM radio as an example. If I use 10 cycles per bit, then I can send 2 MB/sec — that's my bandwidth. Many radio filters can cope with a high noise level if they have 10 cycles to work with. If I only use 2 cycles per bit, then my bandwidth is higher, a bit more, 512 MB/sec, but a little noise will make my filters send a wrong bit, so in practice it may be much less. It looks like five times as much data, but if I have to wait for the retransmission, the usable bandwidth will be much less. The actual bandwidth of a circuit is a complex function of many things, including the screening of conductors and the noise on the line.
Very simply, the basic communication standards between a game and the rest of the system (drivers, APIs, etc.) have remained largely the same over the years, which is why games from even the older days of MS-DOS and earlier can be run under emulators or in a virtual machine. Several services, such as GOG, make a business out of bringing old games to current operating systems. It’s like having an old car from the 1920s that can still drive down the highway, but it won’t look very pretty. A: Basically, it’s pretty much like this.
There is no comparison between a bicycle and a motorcycle, since both have two wheels. A desktop with the same amount of memory as a smartphone is far more powerful than a smartphone, including the CPU, memory, display, and even the type of RAM, let alone the number of USB devices, hard disks, network cards, and more. There is a lot of hardware that needs to be added, so the weight increases.
The specific details are secret and change frequently, so that robots don't find them. However, there are a lot of ways to recognize you when you are browsing the web, such as your exact web browser and OS version, cookies, and from which site you are coming. One way to see how much you are a bot. Like if you're on youtube every second, like thousands of videos, and leave comments, but you don't watch any. Definitely a bot. But if you watch the video and you also leave a comment at the end of the channel, then you go to a store to buy pistachios, you're probably a human. And you probably are not a bot.
.  . [FILESIZES][IDKS] It's like you and your little brother are painting on a different size of canvas.  Yours is one foot, and his is two feet. You pick up a brush and paint a beautiful waterfall and animals. And your little brother painted a happy face. Even though the canvas is bigger, the number of details is fewer and the strokes are less. Similarly, if we say the size of the frame, although it has an impact on the size of the file, it is only a small fraction. The main determinant of the size of the file is the bit rate, which is a combination of the sharpness and color and brightness of the picture.
Imagine you have a huge empty warehouse the size of a football field. It’s completely dark inside except for a light by the door. You can enter the warehouse, but you’ll probably bump into something and get lost. The malloc function draws a glowing box on the warehouse floor and places an illuminating sign on the box saying, “Sugar.” If you come straight to the box, you won’t get lost. You can take the sugar, store it, and come back to the door. In the simple allocation system, the box and sign are a single entity, but it limits you to a certain predetermined box and sign. Malloc draws only the box, but you have to make the sign yourself.
A neural net consists of cells. The cells of a neural net are really just data items, very simple on their own. They take some input data and perform some calculation on it, then they output the result. Very often, the calculation is simply to multiply the input with some number (a weight), then to add up the products, and to produce the total. Take a lot of cells and put them in a row. In each row, the output of each cell is an input to each cell in the next row. But the first and last layers of the net are special. The cells of the first layer usually only take in one input, and the cells of the last layer normally take in the entire output of the preceding layer and produce the usual sum (or, often, some value between 0 and 1; sometimes, only 0 or 1). The “magic” of neural nets is in the choice of weights. Since neural nets can be very complicated, there are some strategies, often involving feedback, that allow the net to be “trained” on known data, so that it will produce the desired output.
It has to do with how hard it is to calculate something as simple as a file copy, you might think it's a matter of measuring how much space is involved and dividing it by the speed of the transmission, but neither of these is a consistent figure in a running system. Copying one file may mean many different things, it may be a folder or an archive, which is in fact not one file but a collection of smaller files tied together by a certain system link. Just think of it as moving a houseful of boxes; you have a hundred boxes to move from point A to point B - but some of them are under pieces of furniture, which means you have to reach for them more carefully, some of them contain glass utensils, so you have to be careful, some boxes are just full of stuff, the stuff is all over the place. So you might take an average time for moving one box, but what if the last ten boxes are all very slippery and very heavy? That would be your estimate would be very wrong. And that is the main reason why most modern systems do not make reliable estimates. The other thing would be to calculate the exact contents and weight of each box before you move it, the trouble is that such calculations take much longer than simply moving it. So would you like to wait five seconds to learn that it takes only three seconds to copy a file? I think not.
It depends on what memory it's trying to find, but usually the answer is "the operating system has a table of contents for its own memory that it can check." If the memory is in the main memory, the program usually just gives it the address. During execution the program is at some point saying, "Okay, go to address X, read the next byt en - " oh, you get the idea. You can also specify relative addresses ("go back ten from the stack pointer") or sequential addressing ("go to this location and read everything that comes after it until you find a null pointer"), but in general the program doesn't get access to the actual memory of the computer but is instead given a "sandbox" where it can think that the entire main memory is at its disposal. The operating system takes care of all the fine details of how it translates between the virtual memory and the actual memory. If it needs something from the hard drive, the operating system has a large table of contents for its memory on the hard drive that it can consult.
1s and 0s are just convenient building blocks to make something more complicated out of. There are billions of different ways to interpret a sequence of 1s and 0s. Just like Spanish and English use the same Latin alphabet, but they mean something different, and you may not understand the other unless you speak both. You can think of x86 and ARM as just other languages. They’re made by humans, and people made the hardware to interpret them. They don’t understand each other, just as your average Englishman doesn’t understand Spanish.
This is entirely possible, but wouldn't help in the slightest. A text file is also a pattern of bits, usually 8 bits per character, sometimes more, sometimes less (old systems). If you did what you suggested, you'd only increase the file size by a factor of eight, and it would be impossible to read it in any way without converting it back to bits. Besides, nothing prevents you from copying and pasting the file for backup the old-fashioned way.
What do you want to do that you don't think you can do? I ask because it sounds like what you're describing is a remote-desktop or in-house-streaming situation to me, and in 2021 there are several decent options for doing that, so I don't know what you think you can't do.
The push of a button. Button closes a circuit. Circuit sends electrical signal to the central control unit. The central control unit detects the electrical signal and informs the operating system. The operating system finds out which program is currently running and sends a ‘here, this key has been pressed’ message to that program. The program check the message queue and sees the message. The program sets a flag that this button has been pressed in the current frame. The program that controls movement of your character check the flag and start to move your character.
Short answer: The connections. RAM is closer to the CPU, and the connections are faster. There is even a memory layer even faster than RAM called a cache, which sits on the CPU die itself. Harddrives are connected using another connection protocol, which is basically a wire. So they're inherently slower. Hard drives have another problem, too. They have a spinning platter with a magnet and a head that rides on it. That slows the drive down. These days, no one uses harddrives for anything other than storing large amounts of data. NVMe is a new storage protocol, however, that sits on the motherboard's bus and can reach speeds close to that of RAM (in theory).
There are two main differences. One is related to language syntax, and the other to external references. If your data structures do not contain references to other data structures in the same file, then the difference is minimal, and only arises when a certain file format cannot be represented in a certain language. For example, in a file you might have a sequence of bytes that represent a counter, but there is no equivalent data structure in C. In Pascal, however, there might be a string, but this depends on the implementation. Then there is the byte order issue that can make data written on one system incomprehensible on another. If your data structures contain references to other data structures, there is another problem. In a statically typed language, references are usually memory addresses. But what are they in a file? The offsets in a file? On the other hand, dynamically typed languages, such as Python, often have more complex references than just memory addresses. In this case, references are more like loading instructions than memory addresses. To answer your second question, if you can deal with these issues, it is indeed possible to save and transfer data structures. But people often want a universal solution that is not dependent on these issues. And that's why we have XML, JSON, serialization, etc.
A signed distance field is a funny way of defining surfaces. Suppose I want to define a sphere. I could say: The center is here, the radius is R. Suppose I want to define a cube. Then I could say: The corners are here and the area is defined by the surface between them. But you can see that these are not really compatible descriptions. You can't define a sphere by its corners and you can't define a cube by its center and the length of its sides (at least without specifying the orientation, too). A signed distance field is a generic way of defining almost any surface. For every point in space, you assign a number. This number defines the distance of this point from the surface (the distance), and you give it a positive or a negative sign, depending on whether it is inside or outside (or vice versa, it doesn't matter, as long as you are consistent). All the points that are zero are the surface, everything else is some positive or negative number. This has some advantages in gamedev. It's easy to merge two surfaces, just add the distances. It's easy to check if you are inside or outside the merged surface (what sign do you have?). It's easy to check how close you are to the closest surface (what's the distance to the closest surface at this point?). Etc. There are some pretty good youtube videos that show it in real time, that make the math more transparent.
The answer is a combination of factors: The most obvious is that you're normally doing more things on your computer than you did before - some of these are unnoticed things brought in by Windows Updates and in particular by Chrome updates. At first, Chrome was quite lean and efficient and a hell of a lot faster than Internet Explorer but it has slowly got fatter and fatter over time. But it is not only the browser's fault. As PC speed, memory, browser efficiency and general Internet speeds have increased, so too have the web pages, especially the ones that try to push advertising at you (usually via pop-ups). This is true for many other kinds of software too: As the computer has got more and more powerful, so has the software, trying to use more and more of it. There are very few security-related updates that actually speed things up. Failure Rates - Memory, CPUs, GPUs, HDDs, SSDs, all have failure rates and they all get worse over time, especially if your system overheats. I'm not talking about total failures, I'm talking about bad sectors, parity errors in the memory. Modern operating systems and firmware do an excellent job of dealing with this - often without your even noticing. The bad sector is quietly ignored and the next best one used. But if this happens it introduces a kind of permanent fragmentation to your drive. During the days of Windows 98, it was quite common to reformat your system at least once a year - not necessarily because of complete system failure, but because you wanted to have a fresh version because over time you add and remove programs, get viruses, run registry cleaners, install all kinds of Updates, and do your own Registry tinkering, all of which lead to the registry and the system files not being as efficient as they could be. Registry cleaners have a mixed record: They can often point out all kinds of problems but their solution is to delete them. My recommendations: Scan your PC regularly with an up to date Anti-Virus program. These days, if you're using Windows 10, Windows Defender is an excellent option for free. If you can afford to buy an SSD, do it now. The HDDs are still good for data storage but your system and your games should run off an SSD. Do a fresh Windows install - Especially if you've moved from one version of Windows to another or from one major version to another, you will be amazed at how much faster your system will run if you start with a fresh system. This will also be much easier if you move to an SSD. Get a bootable USB stick from the Microsoft site and load a fresh copy of Windows with none of the manufacturer's crapware on it. Make sure you've backed up everything you need, files, passwords, bookmarks. Uninstall all unneeded software, especially the kind that installs its own services. If you can, use portable versions of your programs so you know they won't clutter up your registry, system files and services. Always check if there is a default Windows program that does what you want. Block advertising in your hosts file - this is a more technical option that I wouldn't recommend for beginners but it is better than using an Ad Blocker program. You can do this in a couple of ways: First, if a particular page is running too slowly I check it against the 'webpagetest.org' site, then I find the external links that are slowing things down and I block them in my hosts file. If anyone has less than 8Gb of memory I always recommend they get more. If you're using Windows 10, 8Gb is the minimum.
SPI has one master device and one slave device. One of the lines is used to send bits from the master to the slave (master-in-slave-out, or MISO), and the other for bits sent from the slave to the master (master-out, slave-in, or MOSI). The master also controls the clock, and the bits are meant to be read only when the clock changes. There is also usually a chip-enable line to allow more than one slave device to share the same MISO, MOSI, and clock. So if you have five SPI devices, you have five separate CE lines plus the shared MISO, MOSI, and clock. At any one time, you can disable four of the CE lines. To learn more, you have to read the datasheets for the chip and the microcontroller to understand the details, such as the timing requirements, whether bits are sent on rising or falling clock edges, and the format and meaning of the communication with the device. (For example, you might have an SPI temperature sensor: Which bits do you send to request a temperature measurement, and which ones do you expect back? You have to read the datasheet for the temperature sensor to get the answer.) There are lots of platform- and microcontroller-specific tutorials for SPI. Basically, you can just switch the clock and the MISO line to transmit a bit, and then set the clock and read the MISO line to receive a bit. The microcontroller also has an SPI peripheral on certain pins, which can send or receive bits in a limited way without any help from the CPU.
API: Application Program Interface. The most common way of implementing an API is a form. “Please enter your name here, your account number there, the amount in US dollars, sign and submit to X”. RPC: remote procedure call. To make something happen in another system. The most basic of all APIs is the one on your own system. RPC is a kind of API that is designed to fit in with the HTTP protocol that underlies the web.
Nowadays most games are developed with some sort of middleware, such as Unity, and this middleware is built to work on different platforms in a very similar way. That means that you can develop and design a game in Unity 4 and it will run on Unity 5. It’s a fairly good rule of thumb that you can double your polycount every two years. So that gives the art department a target to aim for. If your framerate is low at the beginning, it doesn’t matter – hardware will catch up.
Sadly, there are a lot of DFs. For example, the.doc and.docx formats used by Microsoft Word, the.fm format used by FrameMaker, the.frm format used by FrameMaker, and so on. Each company has a lot of them, and there are a lot of them. None of them are portable.
In order to make a chip, you project its shape with light on to photosensitive material. The result is always a flat chip. Of course you could stack several of them together, but then it would be hard to keep the heat away from the layers inside that “sandwich.” It would get too hot. There are, however, some mainboards—servant mainboards—that have room for two or four CPUs. That’s one way to get more chips...
The result is that they don’t. They’re not even the same thing. First of all, they’re not even the same thing. Secondly, Laptops share a lot of hardware components, whereas a dedicated graphic card has its own separate hardware. In the end, a modern Nvidia or AMD graphic card is bigger than a whole MacBook Pro board. They like to put out some big numbers, but the devil is in the details that they don't tell you. The main thing is the heat. The big cards are much better at dissipating heat. The laptop reduces the speed of the graphic card and the CPU in order to keep the temperatures bearable. It is thus before a regular graphic card does so.
- in most cases, a storage problem. According to the current record, this procedure took up to 318 terabytes of storage and a hundred days. It would have been possible to just add more drives and wait, but a supercomputer calculating digits of Pi isn't a profitable activity, and people who own a supercomputer aren't very interested in letting what is basically a show run longer than necessary to break the record. They just choose a number, calculate how much time and space it will take, and click the start button.
Terrorbytes are worth a terrifying amount! Joking aside, the larger a memory card, the more densely it must be packed with memory chips. Since the dimensions of a micro SD card are fixed (as is the amount of energy that it can consume) it becomes a lot more difficult for chip manufacturers to squeeze more data on to the same die. And right now, there is a global shortage of memory chips. This is because of the Covid. Many industries had to shut down temporarily, including the chip manufacturers and all the suppliers to the industry. Now that things are gradually getting back to normal, demand is rising but production is not yet fully back on track. This has resulted in shortages and higher prices for all microelectronic products.
The SSD memory and the memory in the RAM are completely different. For a certain time to keep data in the EEPROM without power, a relatively strong electric field is used to pull and push the charge from the gate. This causes the extremely thin insulator to wear away and wear out over time. In contrast, the floating gate in the RAM cell is not used, and there is no insulating layer, so it does not wear easily. SRAM is much faster than a solid-state drive, but it cannot be used in situations where power will be interrupted.
It’s a difficult question. I’ll try to explain it as simply as I can. In the making of a large-scale animation film, you have various departments each of which is responsible for a different aspect. There are those who make the 3D models, and they build everything, all the props, like plants, a cart, a table, and so on. They use a program such as Maya, or the Blender or the kind of program they’ve been trained to use. Then there are those who create the textures, so that the things look like skin, metal, wood, etc. (their job also involves creating many small details). They use Photoshop, Substance, or whatever program they’ve been told to use. Then there are still others who prepare the objects for animation by giving movable objects virtual bones and controls for movement. Then there are the animators themselves, and those who light the scenes. Then there are those who compile all the various shots, light them, and so on. Various studios, like Pixar, have their own in-house software that makes it possible to extend the functionality of the software they use. Their work looks different because they have a certain design and movement language that they purposely keep to. There are also special skills involved, and then there’s the custom software. The blending of the two visual worlds is sometimes called cel-shading, or more commonly, NPR, which stands for Non-photorealistic Rendering. This effect is achieved by not trying to reproduce real materials. Sometimes the textures are digitally hand-painted with visible brush strokes, and sometimes a lot of advanced mathematics goes into making the lines of a character like Spider-Man look hand-drawn by performing a series of unholy operations on the edges of his silhouette on each frame.
Because you don't become a $ 1 billion company if you build a product that lasts forever. You have to buy a new one every year, so you hide some kind of technological development for the following year. I'm sure it gets better from year to year, but with the phone it's a little worse...
You load them with a liquid material, usually a resin or a plastic, and the printer "builds" the object layer by layer and hardens the material as it goes. Precisely which material is used and how it is built depends on the printer and the object, but that's the general idea.
Most emulators do what is called "high level emulation" (in other words, they don't really simulate the original hardware as much as they simplify it so that it's easier to calculate). This works for most games for a given system. But certain games used very low level tricks to achieve a spectacular effect. One example is the compression technique used in many N64 games, which has been known to cause problems with emulators for a long time. So there are two ways to deal with this problem. One is to do "low level emulation". This means that you do an exact simulation of the original hardware, down to the point where your emulator functions exactly like the chips that were actually used in the console. In this way, all those "weird tricks" that were used in the game are preserved, because the emulator is basically the same thing as the original hardware. This is a completely impossible task on a console with an older architecture, and even with the SNES it takes enormous computing power, so it is only used for emulator development and by people who are looking for bugs in old games to make the speedruns. The other way, which is what's done most often, is to write a special hack that allows the game to run with the emulator's HLE core. N64 games are now able to be emulated because someone wrote a hack that can figure out how their compression worked, so that they can now be run with HLE. Of course, since these are game-dependent, you need to write a new hack for every game that uses such a trick, and not every game has such a hack yet.
A DDR4-2400 is actually the number of transfer operations per second. It operates at the rising and falling edges of the clock, so the number of operations per second is two billion. The bus clock is only 1.1GHz, and the clock speed of the actual chips themselves is actually only 300MHz. A bit confusing, huh? So it's a number of transfers per second, which is related to, but not exactly the same as the speed of the actual device. And it gets even more complicated because now there's QDR memory.
It is extremely complicated, so it won't be in the eli5 manual. But the basic idea is that they read the program character by character and build a tree based on the rules of the language (that is, a grammar). When it's done, each node in the tree gets the appropriate code from a lower level language, like an assembly language that is used to communicate directly with the CPU, and it turns the high-level language into a lower-level language. So if you have, for example, 3+5, the parser will first look for an operation, that is, a plus sign. Then it will check if it complies with the rules that have been defined, such as that a plus sign has to have numbers on both sides. So then it will make a tree with the plus sign at the top and its children being the numbers. Then each node gets the appropriate code from the lower-level language, and it gets compiled down to that. In the end it is just a map from one language to another. Interpreters are the same idea. But there are some differences between them. They have essentially the same fundamental process. The parsing process is a recursive function of the rules of the language.
. You only have one Internet connection and it probably goes over copper wires. Copper loses quality at longer distances. These big companies have many, many Internet connections all over the world and they are made of glass fibers that can transmit data for many kilometers without any significant loss. 10 or even 100 GIGABITS (1 GIGABIT = 1000 MEGABITS) are very common. And let me point out that the company does not own everything in one place or in one country. In the Steam settings you can, for example, choose the location from which you want to run your Steam game. So Steam has servers in all these locations, and those "TERABITS" are the total of all these servers. The servers in Washington alone can not provide the entire world's game download needs, but everyone selects the nearest one (or the system automatically selects a location), each location can be much smaller. So yes, it's possible.
1NM is only a measurement, it has no special meaning, and 1nm has no more significance than a point half the way or two meters. The ultimate limitation in manufacturing is physics—our ability to do, measure, and control things at smaller and smaller scales. Perhaps we will be working with photons rather than with electrons. Perhaps we will develop a means of controlling quantum states. Perhaps we will develop architectures for massively parallel processing. We have many areas to explore and develop, besides scaling down.
Let’s say your processor has two memory controllers and each memory controller is connected to two slots, for a total of four slots. If you have only one memory stick, then you are only using one memory controller. But if you have two memory sticks, you can get data from memory twice as fast—providing they are installed in slots connected to different memory controllers. If you put both memory sticks in the slots connected to the same controller, you are throwing away speed because one controller is unused.
And, sockets do add a lot of thickness to the whole structure of a laptop. Every 0.01 mm of thickness in a laptop is planned and required. Adding a socket which may be as thick as 5 to 10 mm is a huge design issue. Remember, there is a lot of cooling and heat spreading to be done internally. With a socket, heat will only dissipate to the top surface, which means larger fans and larger air-flow paths are required.
It has a stylus. And aside from that, I believe it is the same as the current model of the Galaxy. With the exception of a slightly larger screen.
The earliest program was written directly in the machine language. Then there was no digital circuitry, just punched cards. This was very difficult. Later, the computer languages were born. You could write in English, and then it was compiled to the machine language.
Yes. It became a real competition, youtubes and streaming videos would spend hours upon hours looking for them after a new map came out. Sometimes the developer would give clues, but often it was a matter of running around randomly, pressing all the buttons, and shooting everything until something happened. They raced to be the first to find the Easter eggs.
The console manufacturers haven’t been kind enough to release all the documentation, source code, and schematics for their hardware and software. So the emulator authors are left to investigate on their own to figure out how the consoles work.
That is because while electricity sends the information through the wires, fiber sends the information through a bundle of glass fibers or plastic glass fibers, and light is very, very fast. So fibers allow you to send information almost at the speed of light, and there is still nothing faster. Wifi, on the other hand, takes the data that reaches your home through the wires and sends it to your device, and radio waves from the antennas in your house bounce back and forth to finally reach your device, but that happens so fast that we consider it to be instantaneous. Wifi is actually slower than fiber, but the signal from the antennas in your home goes to the modem that connects you to the outside world. So they are not comparable. They are used for different things. Wifi is usually for short-range connections between a few devices, but 'the internet' means you can connect to millions of devices across the world.
Some games would copy the entire contents to the hard drive, and some would load other contents from the CD. It was a method to prevent piracy. The game would be incomplete if it did not require the CD to run.
Computational science is a research-oriented thing; it’s the mathematics of computation—algorithm theory and related stuff. Industry uses a lot of Computational Science but, unless they’re at the bleeding edge, most companies don’t do any Computational Science, they just use the results. Computational Science and computer engineering are like physics and aeronautics: the latter uses the mathematical tools and fundamental principles developed by the former.
Not really. The satellites themselves don’t track anything except their own positions. They merely send a signal indicating their own position and time of transmission. This signal travels at the speed of light, which is roughly 300 million meters per second. Your GPS device receives this signal and then calculates the distance by determining the elapsed time between the transmission and the receipt. You need at least a few satellites—four will do—to get a precise fix on your position.
Sure, if they have access to your drive they can read everything. There are nefarious tools to make this easier, but they still have to work to find out everything about you. And depending on who you are, it may not be worth it. But if you have millions, they may want to spend a lot of time to steal your money.
Most of the time, it's written in English. There have been a few attempts to write code in French and Arabic, but they have all failed. A typical program is made up of a few basic words, and it is then converted into a language that the machine can understand. For example, the C language, which makes the hardware and low-level functionality of a modern computer work, only has 32 words. So it's not English as a language, it's just a few basic words, their meaning, and how to combine them to form a series of commands, which the machine then obeys. Coders learn only the code, and not English, or any language as a spoken or read language. It is then translated from the letters and commands that people use, into numbers (in hexadecimal, usually), which the machine can handle. The process of translation is called compiling, and is the process of translating a source language that is almost readable into an unreadable machine language that the machine can handle. Much of the actual translation from a source language (C, C++, Rust, etc.) to the executable code for the machine will depend on the actual CPU in the machine. For example, the x86_64 code compiled on a home computer will not run on an ARM device. The code itself might be the same, but the instruction set that the CPU chip understands has to be specified, and the program needs to be compiled (and sometimes other things not ELI5-related) to run. Most of the code, however, is platform agnostic, which means that most programs can be compiled for another platform. This means that the code that works on a home computer will also work on a phone, but it has to be compiled twice, once for the home computer and once for the phone. And the resulting files will only run on the CPU architecture that was specified during the compilation process.
x86 is the architecture of the microprocessor, a set of common instructions for these microprocessors. This sets the standard for how the instructions in these microprocessors work. In a sense it is the language of the microprocessor, if they speak the same common language, then programs can be adapted to run on many different microprocessors. That is why even old applications still run on modern microprocessors. It's called x86 because the early microprocessors that used this architecture were called the 286, 386 and 486, but the name 586 was changed to pentium, which is a derivative of the Greek word for five, because they were afraid of the fact that they could not register a number as a trademark for a microprocessor, so in the future, they will use words as a code name, such as Haswell, instead of numbers.
It's not that they can't make a high end CPU. There are times when they don't get it right. And as the size of the transistors shrinks and the chip die gets larger, the risk of a flawed chip increases. To avoid wasting faulty chips, they can reduce their clock speed and turn off the defective cores. Then they sell them as low end CPUs.
R&amp;D in general is expensive. You have to pay for many, many hours of work from highly paid scientists and engineers. And they want to get paid even if the research turns out to be a dead end, and the program has to be scrapped and started over from scratch. Then, after you've put a lot of hours into a design, you have to test it. The testing prototype is usually far more expensive than the actual finished product, because everything has to be built to order and there's no one else to build it for. And if the tests turn up problems, then you have to start all over again with the design. Then the total cost becomes totally unpredictable. And if you set a certain budget limit, you might never get a finished design at all. Now, in the case of the F35, that $400 Billion includes the cost of building the actual planes, not just the development.
Hard drives store data magnetically. It’s a disc with a “probe” on it. This probe is able to magnetize small portions of this magnetic disk. The goal was originally to make these magnetized portions smaller and smaller. The smaller they are, the more you can put on a metal disc, which involved making the devices more precise and using different materials that didn’t spread out so much. One interesting example of this is a technology called “perpendicular recording.” In the old days, magnetic data were recorded along the surface of the disc, that is, the north and south poles were on the surface of the disc, which required a lot more space on the surface. Then we switched to recording “perpendicularly,” meaning that you can imagine the disc like a bar magnet going “into” the disc. This was a little harder to do, but it involved having a layer below the surface of the disc that “pulled” the magnetic lines of force into it, so that the magnetic fields were then deeper into the disc. This enabled us to greatly increase the density. Then we started to cram more and more discs into the drive. Modern hard drives contain several “platters” that can be used on both sides. Finally, we’ve finally started hitting limits, and so a recent trend has been to go to so-called “shingled” recording. The problem is that we can read the small bits of data more easily than we can write them. So shingled recording crams so many bits together that it often overwrites a lot of the bit next to it. Then, in a second pass, it “refreshes” it—by rewriting part of the middle bit to make it more reliable and so that the neighboring bits are more readable. It’s like the way shingles on a roof partially cover the lower shingles. Shingled recording has kind of gotten a bad reputation because it has to do these multiple passes. Whether or not this is justified is still being discussed. But we are, in fact, approaching the limits of hard drives, but we’re not yet quite out of tricks. The current thing is called “heat assisted magnetic recording.” It turns out that metals keep their magnetic properties better when they are heated and cooled. So the idea is to heat a small piece of the disc with a laser, and while it’s cooling, write the magnetic bit while it’s cooling. Then you can cram more bits onto a disk. The way that metals work is that they are composed of grains, or crystals, which are all oriented the same way. Every ferrous metal, such as iron, has a grain that is magnetized, but in non-magnetic materials the grain is not aligned in one direction (this is precisely why heating is able to create permanent magnets—it makes the grain move around a little more, which makes all the grains align in one direction). The current technology uses about two dozen grains per bit, but the next step will probably be to go to something called “patterned media,” which uses our knowledge of the properties of materials to turn the random-crystals into something more convenient for recording.
For one thing, consoles are not sold at high prices. The companies make money from the whole ecosystem, so it is in their interest to keep the entry barrier as low as possible.
Who are “we”? The average end-user? Normally, they have no need to know. If you want to know, it depends on the program: maybe it has some way of informing you. Or else you could conclude it indirectly, from such information as: what do the specs say? does it run too slowly? The system? The player itself will have a check that the hardware has the right codecs, etc.
Having a basic knowledge of the GNU/Linux operating system is crucial, because it is the base of the Internet. I recommend a three-part certification program: Linux - network - security.
The BGAs themselves aren't that big—an RTX 2080 Ti is less than 63mm by 58mm. The memory packages are also pretty small, and the power regulators can be made pretty small as well. What takes up the most space are the coolers, the heatsinks, the fans, and the power supply circuitry that keeps the GPU cool. As a result, a laptop dedicated GPU has to sacrifice some performance. A rule of thumb is that you can count on getting a full level of downgrade in a dedicated mobile GPU, so a dedicated mobile 3080 performs like a dedicated 3070.
Not very. To a programmer, it's a real doozy, but it's not very technically challenging. It's just a hunk of data. You can easily cram 3D graphic images into a text file. For instance, the STL format, which is often used for 3D printing, consists of strings like this: a solid model... For instance, the PNM image format is already obsolete, but you can still find it occasionally in Linux systems. This is an example of a bitmap of the letter J. Here it is: Save this as “j.pnm”, and a program that can read it can display it. It's just long and verbose, but it's no great feat to be able to put 3D graphic images into a text file. And HTML is also an example of a format. Ultimately, it's just data. It can be stored and transmitted in any conceivable manner: on a printed page, in words, engraved on stone, sent as smoke signals. It's a matter of finding the right method for the situation.
A deleted file gives the computer permission to use that space to save new files. The old files disappear only when they are overwritten.
They are built in the desert, in the Phoenix area, because the temperature outside has no bearing on the temperature inside. A data center uses absurd amounts of electricity, and a big portion of that electricity is converted into heat and dumped into the air in the data center, which must be discarded regardless of where the data center is located. A desert has dry air, which makes it easier to remove heat from a building. As for dust, that’s taken care of by the ‘envelope’ of the building and filters.
They operate via infrared light. There is an infrared LED in the remote control, and it blinks a certain code to the TV’s remote receiver. It’s almost like blinking Morse code, only it’s not Morse code and the light is invisible to the human eye.
A lot has to do with the budget. For companies with legacy software, it's not just a matter of getting a new operating system. You also have to have someone who can update the mission-critical software. Development, testing, redevelopment, retest and then (here's the killer) retraining the employees. That costs money. But it also comes down to choice. This is often referred to as "legacy disease." People like what they know, and they are resistant to the unknown.
Each standard USB socket delivers a direct current of five volts, unless both the charger and the device in question are capable of handling more.
I think you mean what did people use before the invention of a digital spread sheet? Well, a pen, paper, and a knowledge of how to add (or a calculator).
Fuzzy logic is the study of all kinds of mathematical and statistical methods to estimate the degree of truth or falsity of an event. The basic assumption of classical logic is that truth is either one or zero. Fuzzy logic differs from this in that it allows truth values to take any value between 0 and 1. If we want to answer the question: is the water hot?, classical logic will require us to specify a certain, but arbitrary temperature at which the water is not hot. With fuzzy logic, a transitional zone (foggy) between hot and cold is created, in which the truth value gradually decreases from 1 to 0 when the temperature is lowered.
It's basically like a phonetic keyboard. The phone will convert a bunch of Latin characters into a single mandarin character.
You turn on the power - the cpu reads the bios from the rom on the mainboard - the bios performs a post-check on the hardware (memory, hard drive, display, input) - the bios looks for a bootable partition on the hard drive by looking for the master boot record (MBR) - if found: the bios passes the control over to the operating system by means of bootstrapping - if not found: the booting process stops here.
You do, if you use a special system for dungeons (as in World of Warcraft). You can also encounter them if you move much faster or farther than you should or if the server stumbles and lags behind. But otherwise the whole game world is in the big server at once. This server has about as much in common with your pc as a lorry has with a Camry. Both are cars, but one is much more powerful. So the big server maintains the whole game world and talks to the client (player) side. The client just needs to ask for things in the vicinity. This is an ongoing conversation, and this means that the client only needs to ask the big server for things that are immediately around you. As long as the conversation is fast enough to calculate your position and information faster than you move, the client never has to ask for more than what's in the bubble you're in. There's no need for a loading screen because the load isn't of the whole game world but just of the data that is immediately around you.
In theory, it is possible. This is the essence of decompiling and recompiling a program that has been compiled for one platform to a different platform. The main problem here is that writing such a recompiler is extremely hard. Decompiling alone is already a difficult thing, and it often leads to very obscure code, which is almost impossible to understand, even though it is technically "human-readable", and sometimes has even a few unexpected errors when recompiling because the computer gets confused when it encounters this tainted source code. Adapting these codes to new architectures and assuming what new architectures are like is also not an easy task. In some cases you just encounter the fact that modern architectures don't support the same things as older architectures. Some games on old consoles were doing a lot of bad things in order to optimize themselves, writing to the address of the illegitimate memory to increase their virtual memory, and relying on some very special hardware characteristics (not the architecture of the computer, but the actual hardware itself) that are either impossible to do today or that you will receive a resounding "no, not allowed!" From the target operating system.
Greetings ;) Drives basically have a "map" of where the files are. Deleting data takes time and "wears" the drive. When you delete a file, you cross it off the map, and the space can be reused later. But the files are still there. When you put new data on the drive, the data will be written to these parts later. The same is true of damaged drives. You may have a part that is damaged (including the map, so the drive doesn't show up in the file manager) and another that is still working. As long as the data is not overwritten, you can still recover the files. The program simply reads everything and restores what is still correct. It's like if you ripped the first pages of a book. You just have to turn through all the pages to find out where the chapter begins and make a new index. (I pressed the send button too fast, sorry!)
Cryptocurrency mining has caused far higher demand for graphics cards than expected, let alone reasonable. Add to that supply chain issues and the situation is even worse. Basically, to mine for a bit of b-money, you have to make a lot of calculations. This is something that graphics cards are good at since the calculations are simple but the problem is to do them a lot. So, miners buy dozens of cards, hoping to earn back the money when they get down to business. As the price of digital money rises, the secondary market is going to get even more messed up.
They have to come up with the plot, then they design the protagonist, design the world, and so on. Then they design the cultures. This is probably done before any coding is done. Then they either pick a game engine or create one from scratch. An engine has all the basic parts, like gravity, lighting, putting objects and scripts in the game, and so on, already programmed in. Then they make the whole world. And the buildings, trees, people, monsters, and so on. Various interiors, like inside buildings, dungeons, and so on, might have separate loading zones, and a separate script might be written to make them work. Trigger events are put in the world. Triggers are things that make something happen, like the player going to a certain place makes a boss monster appear. Along the way they play test it, and tweak the plot by removing, adding, or changing certain things, and also by tweaking the animals, NPCs, monsters, and all their scripts. Then it’s released, and it’s a buggy mess, that probably needs ten patches.
The difference is none. All the programs on the iPhone were called ‘apps’, and the rest is history.
Dual and quad channel. Dual channel means the processor and motherboard can use two memory sticks at once, doubling the performance. The memory, that is, not the whole system. In modern times you have quad channel, which is the same thing, the board and the processor can talk to all four memory sticks at once, which means that a single 32 GB memory stick will be slower than 8+8+8+8. However, the difference in performance isn’t as big as it sounds, because from the point of view of the CPU, memory is very slow and the CPU uses its own internal memory, its cache, as much as it can. The speed of the memory only matters when the CPU doesn’t have enough of what it needs in its cache. So in reality quad channel may be useful only for 10-20% of the time. But if your board supports it, smaller memory sticks are cheaper and you don’t see a reason to add more in the future, then there’s nothing wrong with that. All the same, a little gain is better than none. If you look for tests on the Internet, you will see very contradictory results, some games don’t care about dual and quad channel at all, some show huge differences in performance. The reason is that games use memory in different ways. A small, light game will probably not notice much of a difference. But a game that pushes the limits and needs a lot of memory will notice a significant difference.
The business of chip manufacturing is similar to the print industry in that it is divided into design and manufacture. Companies like AMD do not make chips but merely design them; the chips are actually made by companies called “foundries”. The foundries have different equipment with different capabilities, so when they offer their services, they give specifications like “our maximum width of the X-nm-long gates is Y, and we can put Z number of layers of wiring on the chip.” This is analogous to a printing house offering a glossy, four-color, 300 dpi product. This is called the “node”, and the size of the minimum gate they can manufacture is traditionally the deciding factor in naming the node: for example, 5nm or 3nm. Many other things are of course part of the node, but the size of the minimum gate is by far the most important factor. Smaller is better because the smaller the gate, the more components can be crammed onto a chip, the less power is needed to run it, and the faster the speed. 3nm is at the very top end of the scale. The node for current chips seems to be between 4nm and 7nm. This means that, in future, AMD will make use of a foundry with an extremely small node, and that this is a risky strategy, since it may take several years to perfect the 3nm process. Moreover, few foundries are ready for this, so they could face problems in terms of supply. But of course AMD has to be up to date on this, so it’s not necessarily risky; only a bit more risky than, say, Intel, which is aiming to keep using a 4nm node until 2022.

I read on the Wikipedia page on horseshoes some time ago because I was curious why horses had to have them, and I think wild horses don’t have to have them because they walk long distances and that makes their hooves harden in the perfect way, as the eons have shaped them. On the other hand, domestic horses do not walk as much, or they walk shorter distances, or they trot, which does not seem to be good for the development of their hooves. And there is something about the ground being softer in Europe and North America than in the wild. So it is like with human teeth. There are, for example, some people in Africa who still live as people did a thousand years ago, including the fact that they do not cook their meat. These people have straight teeth, because the bones and muscles in their mouths develop to make space for and grow their teeth as evolution has arranged. Here in the “developed” countries, our way of life is so civilized that our jaws cannot make room for our teeth, so most people have to have braces or live with crooked teeth.
That's why you don't have to worry about losing a file if you save it, log off and sleep mode, and then someone pulls the power plug when you're in the middle of creating a word document. One is a sudden and accidental shutting down of all functions, the other is a conscious programme that minimizes energy consumption when its main functions are not used.
The cute response is a biologically evolved mechanism, as is the repulsive one. We can relate to many mammals who depend on their mothers for sustenance, and so we see similarities between them and our children. As for insects, we learned by experience (and it is imprinted in our genes) that if it has legs, a bright color, a strange form, it could be dangerous. There is a reason that the three most widespread fears are: fear of heights, fear of snakes and fear of insects and spiders.
Your ears are shaped in a complex way that makes it possible for the “left/right” principle to work in other directions. Not as well as “left/right,” but it’s still better than nothing.
They were transgender men who had biologically been female. But real men (with XY chromosomes) cannot get pregnant.
They are cut up for dissection by future doctors. It is not usually advisable to practice on the living by the first year medical students. Therefore, they are offered cadavers. The cadavers come from the donated ones.
No, the tourniquet isn't tightened that tight, it just slows down the circulation a bit to make the vein a little bigger. It should be taken off again as soon as the blood is running into the first collecting tube. Also, there are deeper veins and arteries that are less affected than the surface ones.
They don’t “know” anything. They are just chemicals that the body needs in small amounts for certain body processes. They are released into the bloodstream directly when food is digested. When a cell needs nutrients to perform its functions, it takes them from the blood.
It has something to do with sympathy. There was a study in which the more sympathetic the person, the more his yawns were contagious. But not everyone is contagious. A study by V.G. Vyssotsky.
I think it works like this: when your body is cold, the blood goes to the inside to keep you warm. And that means there's less blood going to the outside, to your hands and feet. Your skin becomes stiffer and the blood pressure in your veins increases.
Generally speaking, no. Energy (calories) is required in the same quantity to do the same amount of work. The underlying physical quantities of work and energy, in fact, are measured in the same unit (the joule). But it is possible that with training your body becomes more efficient at doing work, so that less energy is wasted (through improvised movements, panting, etc.). And therefore less energy is actually used. Effort, on the other hand, does not necessarily indicate that more work is being done.
Water flows over the comparatively large, deeply cut surface of the gills. Close by this delicate surface are many capillaries, or blood vessels, that are filled with blood. Among all fishes except the polar icefish, the oxygen is bound to the hemoglobin in the blood by the process of hemoglobin and oxygenation. Carbon dioxide leaves the blood through the delicate surface of the gills. The delicate surface of the gills is possible only because the surrounding water supports it. The icefish has developed a blood without hemoglobin, perhaps as a means of conserving iron. But they make up for this by having larger blood vessels, hearts, and blood, and they live in the cold, well-mixed, oxygen-rich waters of the southern oceans, where they lie for long periods, awaiting prey.
There probably are some differences. But most people are not particularly perceptive or controllable in this respect, so their experiences are often rather ambiguous. Sugary alcohol is very easy to drink. That’s why it’s easier to get very quickly drunk on it. Drinks that are very sour or very strong-tasting are often sipped slower and thus may give a different impression. Eating food definitely affects the speed of alcohol absorption. Drinks taken after meals or with substantial snacks are likely to take longer to have an effect. So if you drink beers while eating wings and potato skins, it’s quite possible that the alcohol takes a little longer to take effect.
Although the brain is not fully aware of what is happening around it, the brain is still aware of the environment in which you are sleeping, which is why sleep in a hotel room is often not as good as at home. The brain is also able to send out many different signals to the rest of the body to slow down the heart and breathing. Also the body temperature should fall two degrees. So it is easier to fall asleep in a room that is too cold than in one that is too warm. If you want to know more about it, you should look up Matthew Walker, he is a specialist.
Horses cannot lie down comfortably because of the shape of their bodies. Horses who break a leg may die a slow, agonizing death, struggling to get up on the injured leg and suffocating on it. For that reason, in most cases they are killed.
Life is like inertia; what is in motion continues to move unless it is disturbed. Our brains and bodies want to stay in the same place; it's harder to wake up from a dream than to get out of a mood. When I feel bad I try to do something that breaks the inertia. A good night's sleep, a glass of cold water, it can be anything.
Both fresh and salt water. The amount of salt water one seagull can drink is equivalent to two gallons of sea water for a human being. In humans, drinking even a tenth of this amount would cause collapse from dehydration of the body. The secret of the seagull’s ability to survive in salt water is a pair of glands in the head, but their function has only been discovered within the past few years. Each gland is made up of thousands of tiny tubes arranged like the bristles of a brush. And the brush handle is a central tube that leads into the nasal cavity. A ring of very fine blood vessels surrounds the glands and draws salt from the blood. The salt is then lost in water that drips from the tip of the beak, each drop containing many times as much salt as tears, five times as much salt as the blood of the gull, and twice as much salt as sea water. Here is a little more on seagulls.
We did not develop the uncanny valley as a phenomenon, but we did develop it as a concept. The phenomenon it describes is that we are fine with artificial creatures (e.g., robots, animations) that are not terribly convincingly human, and also fine with incredibly human ones (or with real humans). But there is a zone in between, with creatures that look and act somewhat like humans, but not quite, and we are very uncomfortable with them. There are various hypotheses about why this happens, and there is some disagreement about exactly what the uncanny valley is. Is it a single phenomenon, or a collection of multiple distinct but contiguous phenomena? Is there a separate “valley” at all, or do people just find everything that resembles humans a bit unsettling? My own view is that the discomfort happens in the middle ground because at the lowest level, if something looks so far from human, it does not trigger our basic perception of being human, even though we can intellectually recognize it as a representation of something human. An extreme example is a stick figure. We know it’s supposed to be a drawing of a human, but we do not have the sense that it is a human. So we are not at all disturbed if the stick figure does not move or act quite like a real human. But then as the resemblance becomes more and more realistic (e.g., if you put a pair of shoes on the stick figure), then you can imagine how the perception of it becoming human begins to get in the way of our basic perception. And as it becomes even more human (as with better and better looking robots or animations), at some point our brains begin to tell us that this is a human. Only this human is not quite right—it’s acting strangely or its movements are clumsy. Or the eyes don’t look quite right. So we get the impression that this human has something very odd about it. Like an animated cadaver. That’s what makes it uncanny. It starts to look uncanny because our basic perception tells us that this is a damaged human, rather than just a representation of a human. In order to get out of the uncanny valley, you have to make the human replica so lifelike that a real human cannot see that it is not human. And we are already starting to do that, in limited ways. Especially for still images, we can already create human faces and bodies that are indistinguishable from real humans, and therefore not in the uncanny valley. But with motion, it becomes much harder to get everything right because you have so many more degrees of freedom. It’s especially difficult to capture the unconscious movements we make, and so animations or robot imitations of humans often look stiff and perform only large, planned motions. You have probably already seen movies in which the human actors in some scenes were completely replaced by digital characters—and you never noticed. That doesn’t always work, but it is beginning to work on some things, especially if you are not trying to match a close-up shot of the human face.
Because a semipermeable membrane like that goes both ways. If we absorbed it easily, we would lose it just as easily. And since we don’t live in a sea of water, we’d be losing water all the time.
Your AA sequence is the basic sequence of your proteins. So your DNA gives instructions to RNA, which gives instructions to AA sequences. But that's not the end of the story. Post-translational modifications can also happen to the AA sequences. These are modifications to the sequences that add sugars, cut out parts, form bonds, sulfonate tyrosines, and so on. If you take a portion of your DNA for a single gene and place it in another person, the post-translational modifications would be different, so the gene would come out slightly different. In order to make it absolutely identical, you would have to change a whole lot more DNA. As for the rest of your body, the parts that aren't made of AA, those are produced by the enzymatic activity of your AA. The AA act as chemical factories and perform certain chemical reactions that create other chemicals that make up your body. And, finally, your DNA makes the AA. Also, your body contains things you can't make by yourself. Sunlight creates vitamin D from a substance in your skin. We have lost the gene for making vitamin C, as did our common ancestor with other primates. So we have to eat it. And then there are things like iron, and sodium, and potassium that are absolutely essential to your body. But you can't make those with your DNA, you have to eat them. And then there are things that you can't make from scratch with your DNA; you can only grow and divide them. For example, you can't make your cell membrane with just your DNA. First you have to have the membrane, then you can add to it, and then you can divide the cells. But there is no gene that can make a cell membrane from scratch. Similarly with the mitochondrion, which are located inside your cells. They have their own DNA and a double-membrane. They can't be made from scratch.
Well, yes of course. The body can die of old age no matter how much help is available. We do not have the knowledge to replace every organ in the body and certain illnesses cannot be cured by a new organ or blood. Could you be a bit more specific in your question?
You don't need to worry about it, just drink more water. And it's not necessary to buy an alkaline water, don't worry.
Because your body wants to keep the heat. And in cold weather it does that by sending less blood to the parts that aren’t a hundred percent vital. That’s because the blood near the skin loses heat more quickly than the blood in the inner part of your body. However, the head has a lot of important organs. Your brain, eyes and so on. These need a constant blood supply even in cold weather. On the other hand, your arms, hands, fingers, ears and so on do not.
No, it gives you less energy. Cooking actually gives us more energy by making it easier to digest.
- Probably not. I am 99.99999% certain that their electrical capabilities are completely under voluntary control. The only thing that makes me wonder is that what if they somehow lost control of those muscles during mating? But that is very unlikely.
Sexually motivated murders are not about lust or sex. They are about control. The killer loves to feel he is master, he can make another person move and feel, he can make another person fear. Killing his victim is the crowning achievement, to play God, to be able to decide whether a man will live or die, and how he will die. The killer wants the victim to feel totally powerless and to die knowing that he was the master of the victim and was less than human. People who commit rape and murders of this kind are selfish narcissists. Their will and desires are the only ones that matter, everyone else is there to please them and do their will. They cannot conceive that someone else could have the will to deny them their desires. They like to see themselves as the strong men who are lustful, and it is the pleasure of watching pornography that reinforces their idea of themselves as masters and when they want sex, they take it. I am not saying that pornography is a bad thing. Pornography is like alcohol. For the mentally healthy it can be a wonderful way of letting off steam. For the mentally unsound it is like giving alcohol to a violent alcoholic.
It is still a question. Here is a hypothesis: It is supposed that baldness begins during puberty, when the growth of the cranium and of the muscles of the forehead and neck increases the tension of a taut band of tissue stretching over the crown of the head. The more DHT there is, the more the muscles contract, and that increases the inflammation, and that increases the DHT. Eventually, the DHT hardens the band of tissue and cuts off the blood and the nutrients from the hair follicles above. The follicles on the top of the head become smaller and disappear completely, while those on the sides of the head remain almost intact. Source:
The following reasons are responsible: During almost every heart surgery, even the supposedly minimally invasive ones, small air bubbles are injected into the patient’s bloodstream. These microbubbles can reach the brain and lodge in the brain tissue, which can lead to a stroke. Usually, this is a clinical non-event, but it could certainly contribute to post-operative memory loss. The use of the heart-lung machine to perform open heart surgery, causes a massive inflammatory reaction, which could cause memory impairment. Besides, surgery as such also causes an inflammatory reaction. The effects of general anesthesia may also play a role, though the connection is not completely clear. All types of anesthesia have been compared (i.e., inhalation vs. intravenous, general vs. regional) and surprisingly, no clear difference in cognition has been shown between the two. One possible explanation for this could be that many heart surgery patients are elderly, and have pre-existing health problems, including memory loss, which could predispose them to develop even more memory loss after surgery. I hope this answers your question. Source: I’m a cardiac anesthesiologist. EDIT: Hey, folks, lots of anesthesia-related questions! Looks like the thread has been locked, so I can’t answer each question, but feel free to DM me. My schedule is unpredictable, but I’ll try to get back to each question as soon as I can. As a general comment, it hasn’t been proven that general anesthesia causes long-term memory loss. We’re still working on this, and obviously, many factors affect why some patients develop post-operative memory loss. Many people have asked questions about themselves or their child, who had open heart surgery and is concerned about long-term memory problems. It’s not easy to give an answer on the Internet, and the cause of such memory problems is complicated. So far, the research on this subject has not been conclusive. But if you or your child had a surgery, and you’re worried about memory loss or delayed development, I recommend you ask a neurologist or a child neurologist for further help. And lastly, it’s perfectly normal to be afraid of surgery and anesthesia, but don’t let your fears take over. Medicine has come a long way since the ether and unwashed hands days. Of course, surgery outcomes are influenced by the type of surgery and the health of the patient, but in the operating room, we do our best to fix any problems as soon as they arise, so that they don’t turn into something worse. Thank you all for your kind words! It’s a challenging job, but I love it. But every successful open heart surgery is a massive team effort, including anesthesiologists, nurses, perfusionists, and surgeons, not to mention the cardiologists and intensivists who take care of the patient before and after surgery. I can’t take all the credit!
Probably because our brains want us to revert to our instinctive fight or flight reactions, and because humans, being relatively poor fighters and fighters, when alone, tend to be more flight-reactive than fight-reactive, we jump and get ready to flee. Of course, our jumps are relatively small in comparison to those of other creatures. A cat, when startled, will leap away, often a foot or more. Since we, as the current dominant species, have no need to be afraid, we are slowly reversing our fear responses, but we will never lose our natural responses to fear.
Mostly it’s down to a build-up of tolerance to the drugs themselves, but in the case of musicians, muscle memory can play a big part too. I used to play in bands and my drug of choice was booze and weed. This was years ago now, but when I was wasted, my fingers could remember songs better than my brain could remember how to speak. So that was my excuse anyway. To be fair, if you play totally wasted you’re more likely to make a mess of things on stage, but bands are very good at covering this up. I often forgot to play my solo because I was so wasted I didn’t hear my cue. We weren’t playing covers so the audience never noticed. If you read Slash’s autobiography, he managed to play atrocious amounts of Class A drugs but still managed to have his moments. Then there are musicians like Steven Adler who were fired because they couldn’t play when wasted and couldn’t kick their habit. Look up Led Zeppelin’s Live Aid disaster. That’s the real deal. Not that musicians get away with it as much as you think, but muscle memory and a build-up of tolerance can cover a lot of blunders.
Not exactly the same. Similar, but not quite the same. To smell something, there must be enough of it in your nose to set the nerves in motion, which send the scent to your brain. To inhale something means that it has reached your lungs. So you can inhale something through your nose and still smell it, and you can inhale something through your mouth and still not smell it. To smell something, it must first reach your nose. And if you smell it, then there’s a good chance that it’s also reaching your lungs, but that is not guaranteed.
The trachea is the tube to your lungs, and the esophagus is the tube to your stomach. The trachea has a little flap that prevents food and liquids from going into your lungs, called the epiglottis. Sometimes food will get past your epiglottis and get stuck on your larynx (voice box). You will immediately start coughing, because your body doesn’t want food or liquids in your lungs. It hurts, so you know something is wrong.
It's having too much dopamine *chronically* or having surges of dopamine without a reason. Dopamine is important in many ways, even in the pleasure of listening to music. But dopamine is eventually metabolized by the body.
The amount of oil used in fast food is usually the reason that your stomach does not like it when it's digested.
Brain games are simply puzzle games that aim to stimulate the brain in a way that other games rely more on reflexes and muscle memory. The only thing I know for sure is that there have been studies that have found that they can improve certain functions of the brain in the short term, but no long-term effects.
I think it’s to protect the plant, not the fruit. If the plant wasn’t thorny, it would be the fruit they would eat, not the plant. The plant “wants” animals to eat its fruit because it spreads its seeds.
* Reddit is not your doctor. * Please ask your doctor to explain these things to you instead of asking non-medical people on Reddit. That's what they're there for.
Why?
Neither lice nor chicken pox is a phenomenon of critical mass. Having said that, one child brings it, and the group quickly spreads. Both are extremely contagious and infectious.
drugs are substances that are chemistrically similar to those substances which the body uses for its internal functions. For example morphine is similar to endorphin (hence the name, endo meaning inside). If you take a drug, the job of this internal substance is done way too well. But the body is not stupid. It knows this is too much and stops producing this substance by itself when you get far too much from outside. The receptors also become more resistant from the continual stimulation, which is why you develop tolerance. Now, if you stop taking the drug, the opposite happens. Now there is not enough of this substance in your body and it takes time for the body to adapt to this new situation. This is dangerous because the body uses these substances for every internal function including blood pressure, breathing, emotions, etc.
The egg, because many eggs were laid before anything even remotely chickenlike was around. This answer is a bit of a copout, though. We need to set the terms: a “chicken egg” is an egg that will hatch into a chicken. It contains all the genetic material of a chicken. A “chicken” is a chicken. That is, the sort you get in barnyards. A “proto-chicken” is the creature that came before the chicken, but is different enough genetically from a chicken that it is not a chicken. When an animal reproduces, some of its genetic material gets passed on. When a chicken (or a proto-chicken) reproduces, the result is an egg. The proto-chicken laid an egg that was essentially the same as the first chicken. This egg is a chicken egg. If we define a “chicken egg” as any egg laid by a chicken, then the egg in my example does not count, and the first chicken was born before a chicken egg was laid. The egg came first. The chicken came first. I would argue the first, but you are free to take either.
The mouth and tongue have the same kinds of taste cells as the bottom, so the inside of the bottom too is able to taste spicy. Moreover, the hot pepper contains a waxy substance which is hard to digest and which sticks to everything it touches and is even harder to get rid of, so that some of it even passes through and sticks to the bottom when we defecate. Then, since the bottom also has the spicy-sensitive cells, it burns.
The former is the study of the brain and the mind, the latter is the treatment of brain and mind. Psychologists are those who study or apply psychology, clinical psychologists are those who treat patients and with whom they deal with their problems. Psychotherapy is the branch of medicine that applies medicine to psychology. Psychiatrists can prescribe drugs and other medical procedures for their patients, clinical psychologists can't. Psychotherapists and clinical psychologists often work together to help their patients.
Essentially, no. So, then, sleep is not one thing. It is rather a sequence or cycle of smaller things. A: Sleep is a series of phases. First comes an initial sleep that is merely restorative and from which you can easily wake up. Then follows a light sleep in which the body begins to rest actively, then comes a deeper sleep, then a rapid eye movement sleep. Then comes light sleep again, then deep sleep, and so on, until you wake up. Each of these phases lasts approximately ninety minutes, so when you sleep, you are actually building up a series of phases, not a full block of sleep. Some people sleep one block at night—a full eight hours (but people sleep anywhere from six to twelve hours, with six considered a sort of minimum), while others sleep four hours, then stay awake for a while, then sleep again, and so on. So, sleep does not stack. But when you are rested, it is easier to stay awake, while when you are chronically tired, it is difficult to stay awake. It is also very important to keep to a sleep schedule, even on the weekend. It is also possible to supplement a shortcoming in sleep with naps. In a study conducted on pilots, for instance, NASA found that, even after a full night's rest, a nap of five to ten minutes could increase alertness and reaction speed. Why does caffeine not work? Your body produces a hormone that makes you feel tired, to warn you that it is time to sleep. Caffeine and this hormone compete for the same brain receptors. (Just imagine eight different USB devices all vying for the same three USB slots.) And after a certain point, your body needs to sleep to even out the balance of the two. This is why caffeine-induced naps work.
Your skin is protected by a layer of oil that your body makes. When you bathe, especially with hot, soapy water, you’re washing away that layer of oil, so your skin can dry out more easily.
A simple analogy: Imagine making a copy of a document with a copying machine. Every time you rescan the scanned copy to make a copy, the quality of the copy goes down. That is what is happening to your cells. Depending on the type of cell, this rescanning can occur every few days or weeks. After 100 or so years, the quality of the copy has gone down to the point where your organs begin to fail. This is also the reason why we get cancer. One of the copies gets a smudge on it, and you can't read it anymore, but you go on copying it anyway.
Because the carrot “feeds” on the greenery, drawing off the nutrients and moisture that the leaves contain. This is why a carrot that’s been trimmed loses its vigor much faster than one that hasn’t.
But only a small number of flavors can be tasted with your tongue, maybe only a few. What you call taste is mostly smell. We can recognize millions of different smells. When your nose is stuffed up, you can't smell as well, and then the food tastes rather bland.
As you so rightly pointed out, these are elementary physiological instincts that do not require any thought or effort. They are like the heart pumping blood or the lungs breathing.
Same reason as you do not taste as salty as the food you eat. Fishes filter the salt from their food and water, excrete it in their urine. But they are more efficient than you, and that is why they can drink sea water and survive.
Water boils at 100° C., but evaporates at any temperature. The temperature measures the average speed of the molecules, but some molecules, having greater speed, break away and evaporate.
According to our genetic makeup, wider hips and a bigger booty translates into greater childbearing capacity. The male's biology seeks to continue the gene pool. And thus the male's attraction to bigger booties.
You know how it is when you’re really hungry and all you can think about is food? You get angry and your judgment goes to pot—you’ll make bad decisions about what to eat when you’re starving. But once you’ve filled your belly, you feel better and stop thinking about food. You also feel bad for having eaten that disgusting trash they call fast food, and you vow never to eat it again. But then, a while later, you’re doing it all over again.
Long answer: it’s a fictional technique used to make the character look cooler. Short answer: The liquid looks like it is holding the body up and that would help regulate their body temperature and maybe even send healing chemicals to external wounds. And they have the resemblance of a womb, which is where we take care of ourselves at our most vulnerable, before birth. But it’s all fictional, so it’s really all for appearance’s sake and has no basis in reality. It’s the visual effect they used to make it look like someone’s in critical care, and they stuck with it.
It is called "monologue" and not everyone hears his voice in his head. The frequency of the monologue in one's head also varies from person to person who does have it. It is a psychological phenomenon, the function of the mind to help the will make decisions and to take in new information.
Well, you know the sugars, like glucose, sucrose, etc. Well, a carbohydrate is basically several sugars chemically grouped into a big molecule of starch. It is digested in the body, and the sugars are converted into energy. People on a low-carb diet ensure that the body does not have much of this energy, and then it has to turn to fat, which costs more.
The Dutch bred them to be orange in honor of their king, William of Orange. The wild carrot is purple, and it was the result of hybridization that a yellow carrot came to light, which was then selectively bred until it turned orange.
- During exercise, muscles need more blood because they are working harder, so the veins enlarge to allow blood to flow. The more you work, the larger and more permanent the veins. You can reduce it by not exercising.
Kinfolk, control, sadomasochism. In a word, a set of fetishes and fetishisms of power and control. One finds it erotic to bind and control someone, or to be a slave. The notion embraces a vast area of possibilities: from simply tying someone up so he feels he cannot escape, to inflicting actual physical pain on him in a consensual setting in bed.
When you're two, one year is half of your life. When you're ten, one year is a tenth of your life, so it seems shorter. When you're eighty, one year is eighty-times your life, so it seems a lot shorter. That's the theory, as I understand it.
Their feet have microscopic hooks that work like Velcro on microscopic irregularities in the wall’s surface. There are surfaces that are too smooth microscopically for some insects to get a grip, but you can’t tell just by looking at them.
The questioner has got confused between time and relative motion. The astro-naut will age relative to his frame of reference. In this case it will be 10 years.
As long as your arms are in the air, you’re enabling your diaphragm to open, and that makes breathing easier. Before the invention of CPR, they would pump their arms in and out to induce breathing.
The transgender inclusive answer is yes, but a better answer might be: what do you mean by your question? What do you mean by “more likely to date a man in the future”? For example? In practice, few people are truly strictly straight or strictly gay. A large number of people who identify as “straight” have had sexual experience with a person of the same gender. And it’s not that doing “gay stuff” somehow makes you more inclined towards one gender over the other. For example, a straight man might be interested in a trans woman with no surgery because he sees her as a woman and is attracted to that, in which case it probably doesn’t mean he’s less likely to be straight in other circumstances. Or he might be interested in her genitalia (though many trans people would prefer he wasn’t) because he’s been able to rationalise that “not being gay” and thereby may be less likely to be completely straight. Or a whole range of other possibilities that have nothing to do with whether or not his interest is “technically gay” or whatever.
E. Coli is a bacillus in the intestinal tract of animals, and is generally harmless to humans. But some strains of E. Coli can produce a bacillus that can be harmful to people. Good hygiene will generally reduce the possibility of contamination. This bacillus can also be found in food, but if you follow good cooking practices and proper cleaning, it won’t affect the health.
It is an autoimmune disease, so it just floats in the air. It is not completely genetic. It is, as all autoimmune diseases, the result of an immune system that is too good at its job. So, you have a kid who is sick and dies young, but you have other kids and your strong immune system survives, then something can trigger it and attack the pancreas, and the kid, or less frequently, the adult, gets it. This continues until, but not by Banting, the invention of the new drug, which starts to make childhood fatalities less.
Saltwater has more salt dissolved in it than what our body has. Consequently, the salt-water balance would be disturbed.
Pride? Anxiety? A sense of well-being?
Your brain has no idea the image on your retina is upside down. And it doesn’t have to. It knows only that the certain signals coming through the optic nerve are corresponding to the certain places in the field of vision.
A substance, around which the cells are surrounded by other cells, namely the skin cells and other cells, is a certain number of proteins and other substances. It is similar to a gelatinous material, which holds water and provides a net, in which the cells are surrounded and stand. It also allows the cells to move freely—like the white blood cells, which can migrate to different places. It is found in many places, not only in the skin, but also in the bone tissue, connective tissue, fat, blood, cartilage, etc. It's like a pot of spaghetti with meatballs under a microscope. The meatballs are cells, and the spaghetti is the ECM.
The article speaks of “a minimum sense of self.” This means simply “I have my own thoughts.” People with a Self-disorder have this diminished or disrupted. They doubt that their thoughts are their own. Someone with a Self-disorder could think they are being hypnotized. They feel that their thoughts are not their own, but are forced on them from outside. Or they doubt that they (or their thoughts) exist at all.
Those elements are incredibly common in the universe. They form water easily, which has unique properties. Water molecules are polar, and its polarity and tendency to dissociate enable it to dissolve almost anything. Salts, minerals, gases, acids. Take a piece of sodium hydroxide, for example, and surround it with hydrogen chloride gas, and there’s nothing very interesting about it. But if you dissolve both in water and let them mix completely rather than just at the surface of the solid, a violent reaction occurs. In general, water enables reactions to occur by dissolution. It mixes things that don’t mix on their own and breaks them up to accelerate or enable reactions.
Probably not much. But a similar experiment was done. A person consumed junk food in excess of the recommended daily amount, but lost a total of 12 pounds. Because junk food is so calorie dense, he didn’t have to eat much. For the full story, see http://www.latimes.com/xpm/health-fitness/twinkie-diet-20101206-story.html.
For several reasons, most of which are bad. The main reason for people to be against GMO’s is the fear of the unknown. Gene-editing and biotech are difficult to understand. Most objections to GMO’s are based on a variation of the old adage, “Anything that is not natural is bad and GMO’s are unnatural.” That’s a flawed argument, because whether something is good or bad has nothing to do with whether it occurs in nature without human intervention or is created by humans. In general, people who don’t understand how biotech works are afraid of the idea of gene-editing, but since lab grown meat does not involve gene-editing (at least not yet) it doesn’t get the same kind of condemnation as GMO’s. In addition, the benefits of lab grown meat are much more understandable than the benefits of GMO’s, particularly since most people already eat meat and are therefore aware of the ethical and environmental problems caused by the consumption of meat.
Reflexes are fast because they are involuntary reactions that are unimpeded by the conscious part of the brain. For example, it takes a certain time to deliberately duck away from an oncoming ball. The conscious decision to duck away from a moving ball, for example, requires a response from the part of the brain responsible for the movement. Seeing the ball, understanding it, calculating the path of the ball, deciding whether to block the ball with your arms or to dodge it or to do nothing, and then carrying out the decision all takes time. Reflexes aren't slowed down in the least. They're controlled by the unconscious part of the brain, and the motor system takes over before the conscious part of the brain has time to even consider what's happening. This makes them very fast, but it also means that an inappropriate reaction can happen, such as the time when a person flinches when someone is hugging him and accidentally hits the person on the face.
One theory is that it was human hunting that killed them off, as they were big enough targets to sustain a lot of people for a long time. However, the whole process of extinction is far more complex than this article can even hope to go into. Just think: elephants, giraffes, hippos, bears, and lions are all megafauna, so they could be around even today.
the majority of humanity did not know what pure food, clean water, or clean clothes were. So the survivors were those whose immune systems fought back most strongly. Now we have hygiene. The immune system, which was designed for fighting against dozens of wars at the same time, has no one left to fight. But better be too careful and react too much than too little. Those who die from it without being able to reproduce it will cause the gene to be eradicated in a dozen thousand years.
Psychologically and not physiologically. In your brain, some linkage has been formed between animal fat and a sense of nausea. Such associations occur in the brains of many people who love animals and do not wish to harm them. Others are under the impression that it is for their own good. Different life experiences lead people to various food-habits.
Because the implant is for enlarging a portion. E.g. breast, buttock, pectoral. It is a pad which is placed under the skin. The penis is an organ, not a part of skin. So, even a small change would affect its functioning. Instead of padding it, we should increase the corpus cavernosum which gets filled with blood, thus increasing its length. It seems that there is a cruciate ligament which can be cut, which is holding the penis in close contact with the abdomen. If we make a surgical change to that, it would increase the length. (E.g. Think of a face-lift or breast lift in a reverse direction) I learnt many things in this thread.
Almost every illness is different, and some infections can cause pain in the part they are infecting. But generally, it’s not the illness itself, but the reaction of our immune system to the illness. When the immune system is irritated, it can trigger inflammation of the muscles and bones. Sometimes the inflammation itself can be uncomfortable and lead to pain. For certain illnesses, such as the flu, the cause is different, because the immune system is attacking the flu virus specifically. The body produces special flu-fighting chemicals, and white blood cells send special signals: “Here comes the flu!” And it so happens that these white blood cells and chemicals irritate our joints, bones and muscles, by a strange and stupid coincidence. This gives you the classic aching flu symptoms. Again, it’s not the flu itself, but our own immune system. The same thing is why some vaccines, such as the flu vaccine, can cause aches and fevers—you’re getting all the immune reaction but not the infection.
Our bodies are a heat engine and, like any other engine, our bodies generate heat that must be dissipated. And the best way to do that is to cool the environment, but only when the environment is cooler than the body.
Oxygen is Reactive, but Nitrogen is not. Oxygen has more reactions, so it can be used to store and transport energy. Molecular nitrogen does not react and so it cannot be used.
For one thing, the more you do something, the more brain cells activate to do the job. Providing your diet is adequate, you build up what wears out, and the more you do something, the more muscle memory you develop.
Pimples are formed when the sebaceous glands under the skin get clogged and the bacteria grow there and infect the gland. Maybe superglue blocks the sebaceous glands, but since there is no infection, there is no inflammation.
Psychedelic mushrooms contain the chemical psilosybe, which is converted in the gut to psilocybin. Psilocybin binds to brain transmitters similar to serotonin and stimulates the visual areas of the brain. It’s an interesting experience, but the Netfilx psychedelics documentary you were talking about makes it sound like everything is spiritual and loving. Is it? But it can also be awkward and scary.
Energy is a word with several meanings. Here it refers to psychic energy, which is not stored in a particular organ. You must not apply physical laws to psychic energy; it exists in a different context.
A person sweats less in the cold and that's why they pee more often. In hot weather you sweat a lot, so you don't have much urine.
: It means that one day your organs gave out, that your heart stopped, that you had a stroke, etc. It just happens overnight, it's not worth investigating and defiling the body to find out exactly what caused it, so they say it was "natural causes.
- It's like a computer program. It's just 0 and 1, and doesn't have many combinations, but if you combine it enough, you can have all the combinations you want - you just need to make it long enough. Since it's really the length that determines the complexity, the set is actually determined by the length. Since the ends are defined, the proteins can be as long as needed.
If plants need a man to tend them in order to grow, there would be no plants. Seeds need some way of being distributed or they cannot propagate. Some seeds have to be exposed to great heat before they open, in order to replace trees that burn in forest fires. Some seeds have wings and fall down, aided by gravity and aerodynamics, for example, the seeds of dandelions and similar plants. I have a weed in my front yard which shoots out seeds at the slightest touch. The seeds don’t have to fall to the ground to start growing. They grow a root on the surface which then sinks into the ground, then sprouts a stem aboveground.
Your skin tries to protect itself by producing little swatches of color to block out the harmful rays of the sun.
It is due to a natural flaw, and so it is really a mercy killing. Humans have the resources to enhance the quality of life for the crippled; animals haven’t. They eat it because it is free food. Finding food is difficult enough as it is.
Spicy is not caused by the heat, but rather by the chemical, for example capsaicin in chili pepper, which makes your nerves assuming it's hotter than it is, and send signals to your brain. Your brain thinks you're burning. Spicy is spicy. And it also happens on the other end, if the corrosive withstands the digestive system. But this time the nerves are tricked in your buttocks instead of your mouth.
Cancer cells are your cells that have mutated beyond all recognition into enemies. That means your immune system will never detect them and will tolerate them indefinitely. It also means that they have the same physiology as human cells, so that they cannot be destroyed without destroying all human cells. So a medical science finds itself in a critical situation. Your own cells are trying to kill you, your immune system is ignoring them, and you have to destroy these camouflaged rebels without killing everything. And it will not cure itself, so without treatment the outlook is always fatal.
No one really knows. No one knows for sure. We have lots of hypotheses, but when ketamine comes along and seems to work instantaneously while Prozac takes weeks, then the game is over.
Fear is the first thing that comes to mind, but when you’re sure nothing can get you, you don’t need to worry. It’s like the Japanese police not chasing a car because they know it’s too slow. You can run away, but it’s better to conserve your energy. You can use it to make a sudden flight when you need it, but don’t waste it running from something that can’t catch you.
A cloned human would resemble the original as a conjoined twin resembles its twin. Cloning an organism is like artificially conceiving an identical twin, namely two organisms with the same genome.
A large portion of human DNA is conserved. Yet, between any two humans there is an average difference of about 6.4 million base pairs. Every pair is a 50-50 shot, so to have all 6.4 million pairs identical is akin to flipping a coin 6.4 million times. The probability of a match of this order is so infinitesimally small that it is essentially 0.
Somewhere during a long and long period of time, someone developed a random mutation for fearing snakes. And for generations they had children who feared snakes, while other people who did not have this mutation were killed by snakes and did not have children. Eventually, the descendants of those who feared snakes outnumbered those who did not. The same thing is probably not going to happen with guns. The technological process is more rapid than evolution. Weapons in ten thousand years won't look like guns.
Some medications are absorbed at a faster rate than others. So they need to be taken often to avoid the dreaded effects of too much or too little medicine in the system. Few medicines have effects that last longer than a week. If you are taking medicine monthly, it is most likely to treat a disorder that is related to the menstrual cycle or to the use of slow-acting medications. This means a pill that slowly dissolves and keeps releasing medicine. Naturally, this can’t be done orally but has to be injected.
They are not supposed to hydrate. They should rather replenish minerals or salts or ions, whatever they are called, which may have been lost during intense exercise. And they also contain sugar, to replace the calories you’ve burned up during that same exercise. But unless you are a top athlete who is actually competing in a contest, you don’t need a sports drink (even then, there’s little evidence that it helps). A normal diet has more than enough salt for even the most obsessed of athletes. Even if you drank nothing but distilled water, there’s still more than enough salt in your diet.
Releases the pressure in the ears. Also occurs when you hold your mouth and nose closed and try to breathe out. This can be useful in planes when the altitude changes. Otherwise you may start shouting at the stewardess. Also useful during mountain drives or hiking.
No, actually not. Tests show that doctors have no worse handwriting than other health care workers or any other profession. In a nutshell, they do have pretty bad handwriting. During the study and practice of medicine, there is so much to write that the time is so short, so that the handwriting is directed towards speed rather than readability. The reason why people especially notice the handwriting of doctors is because you can see their handwriting regularly in the form of prescriptions.
It's only recently been discovered that the brain doesn't reach maturity until age 25. Society has long established 18 as the age of adulthood, and it's too late to change it now.
For the same reason that your cousin looks very much like your grandmother and you do not, it does not mean that your cousin is more related to your grandmother than you. For they may both carry some external and visible markers of their relation to each other, but your DNA is so densely packed that these markers have little meaning. Both huskies and poodles are “grandchildren” of ancient wolves.
The muscles are used for different purposes when the animal is alive. For example, a chicken breast is not much used in the life of a chicken. Longer fibers mean the muscle has to store more oxygen which means more myoglobin which gives it its red color. The chicken breast has very short fibers which gives it a slick, slimy texture when it’s raw and little myoglobin which makes it white. TL;DR: a lot of use = long fibers = lots of red color - not much use = short fibers = little red color - long fibers = tougher and chewier - short fibers = softer and tenderer
If your liver and kidneys didn't work properly—that is, didn't cleanse your body—you'd be dead. No more to say.
The brain releases a hormone called ghrelin when your stomach is empty, or when you expect to eat. Ghrelin makes your stomach secrete acid to digest food. If you don’t eat, the acid attacks the lining of your stomach and you feel hunger pangs.
Because oxygen and nitrogen, the two gases that comprise the bulk of air, become poisonous at the higher pressures that exist at greater depths. In order to avoid the toxic effects of these gases, the partial pressure of these gases has to be reduced, and that means modifying the proportions of nitrogen and oxygen in the air or, in the case of helium, replacing some of the nitrogen with another gas, preferably helium.
- There are a few reasons for that. First, an owl is a carnivore, and in an environment carnivores can live far fewer than other kinds of organisms. Owls are also much rarer than omnivores like seagulls. They are active at night, and we are not. Take that together with the fact that they are far away from people and avoid populated areas, and an owl sighting is a pretty rare experience.
Yes, the blood leaks out and enters the surrounding tissue. This is what bruising is. Unless you have blood clotting or other such problems, it will heal on its own.
The difference of potential across the membrane of any cell is of critical importance in regulating the passage of various ions into and out of the cell, because that controls a variety of important processes and signals. But action potential is a special term referring to the process of membrane depolarization that runs along the nerve. It is the actual nerve signal, so needless to say its proper functioning is extremely important.
It does not seem that it is possible to have a fever with a fish, because fish are ectotherms. This means that they do not have the mechanism that makes their temperature rise.
Maybe something to do with the blood circulation? The blood goes from your whole body to your heart to get heated up, and then flows back out, warming the rest of you up, doesn't it?
Because gases are either heavier or lighter than air, and that's what the sound waves are used to vibrating in. Helium is lighter than air and thus the sound waves travel faster through it while resonating in the larynx.
The bodies are still there and they are dead. They were only killed, so they would not multiply later in your stomach and cause a problem. But no magic process is going to magically remove them or their poisonous by-products, which is why it does not render the rotten meat edible.
Yes and no. Drinking a lot of water after eating a lot of salt is a good idea, because it will dilute the salt and keep you hydrate. But you still have to trudge with all that salt in your body, it's still there. So this salt will eventually get through your body, through your blood, wherever it goes, and probably ends up as sweat or urine, after your kidneys have filtered it from the blood. So it's good to drink water, but it's not the same as counteracting the salt.
The sinuses (the cavity into which your nostrils lead and from which air is carried into your trachea and lungs) are not one single cavity. They are, instead, four chambers, two on each side (in 10 percent of the population, the chambers are six and three on each side). Thus, any one of the four chambers can get inflamed at any time and cause stuffiness on one or both sides. And yet the body is very clever and wants to keep you breathing (unless you have sleep apnea), and so it regulates the tissue of the two sides of the cavity so as to make sure you can breathe through at least one. This warming and humidifying of the air that is inhaled into the lungs through the nostrils is a very demanding process. For this reason, the body merely allocates the requisite extra blood to one side at a time. But since this entails swelling (similar to the swelling of the area of the skin around a scratch, which is caused by the increased circulation to the wound), when you are sick, you have increased circulation to the diseased side and this aggravates the stuffiness of the side that is receiving the extra blood. Here is a great article about it that provides the scientific evidence:
My understanding—please check this with someone who really knows about these things, not someone like me who hasn’t—is that your brain has associated squid with your bad experience of food poisoning. So, even if you’re eating squid of good quality that’s been properly prepared, your brain’s going to think, “Oh, this is the food that made me sick, even though it was a one-off experience.” I had a similar experience in high school with hot pockets and a stomach bug. I’ve never been able to eat hot pockets since.
Your eyes are controlled by muscles like everything else in your body. When you look at a screen, your eyes are fixated on a very close spot, narrowing your field of vision both mentally and physically. Looking far allows your eyes to use their muscles in another way, which leaves the tense state, and gives the brain different information to process. Think of it as looking up or even right after having your head turned to the left for an entire day.
because you’re squashing the blood out of them. Tiny capillaries under the nails are what keep them pink. When you press on the nail, or when you’re very cold, they close up and don’t let fresh blood through. If you press on your fingernail until it turns white, then let go, it should turn pink again in about five seconds. This is called the capillary refill time and is an indication of a healthy blood supply.
When you swallow, the soft palate lifts up and makes room. You're expecting to swallow something, so you don't gag. But a finger makes you feel like something's stuck in your throat. And it feels so uncomfortable that you want to throw up.
The oesophagus has muscles which keep on contracting to push the food to the stomach. This continues no matter what position our body is in.
They want to divide faster than healthy cells. They want to kill the cancer without killing you. So chemo uses poisons that only hurt cell division and that are more toxic to the cancer cells than the rest of you. But because it is still poison —poison that's so powerful it kills the millions of cancer cells in your body—it still does a lot of harm to the rest of you.
There's no set timetable, it depends on the individual. To be clear and simple, alcohol affects, among other things, a brain system called the GABA system, which acts as a brake on brain cells, slowing down the nervous system and "normalizing" the firing of the nerves. Alcohol acts as a kind of proxy for this system, and since the brain always strives for balance, if you're exposed to a lot of alcohol for a long time, your brain will figure, "Well, since alcohol is here, I guess I don't need the original GABA system." That's how you get addicted; when you quit drinking, you no longer have that cooling system in your brain and it takes several days for it to start working again, so you'll get shaky and agitated and delirious, and you can die from it. Now, as for how long it takes to get to that stage, I don't think there's any clear answer, although it generally takes a lot of time and regular exposure; and everyone is different; there are alcoholics who've been drinking for decades who show almost no physical withdrawal symptoms, while some newcomers are very sick. And as for your question, one a day for a year or seven a week for a year? Both are bad. One is close to the classic alcoholic lifestyle, regular daily drinking. That's worse because you can't think clearly, you get headaches and feel dizzy; the other is binge drinking, where you drink a lot in a short time. Binge drinking can lead to alcoholism and other mental problems.
Your eyes are spaced a little apart, and they’re usually not precisely aligned, so they take in slightly different images. Close one eye, point to something in front of you with your finger, and without moving your finger, close the other eye. Now open the closed eye and you’ll see that your finger no longer points to the same object, because it sees a slightly different image. The further the object is from you, the less difference there is between the images. The brain combines these two images to create a sense of depth. I don’t know how the brain works, I just know how the eyes do.
They don't. If their simple brains tell them you're a threat, they sting you and, sometimes, they also secrete a special chemical that marks you as a threat to their friends—whether you're trying to harm them or not. People have been stung to death by insects because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
That's because red cones are almost as sensitive to violet as blue cones. The L (red) cone has a very long tail in its bell-shaped sensitivity, while the S (blue) cone has a much more convex curve. At the violet wavelengths,  420 nm, the sensitivity of the S cone starts to fall off very rapidly. By that time the red cone has long since dropped off, but the very long tail is still there, and the curve is falling only very slowly. At  405, the blue cone has been so heavily weakened that it is no longer much more sensitive than the red cone. This is a kind of mixture of red and blue light. But neither blue nor red cones have a very good sensitivity to violet, so it's not very bright.
A human being can survive a deficit of nutrient substances but not a deficit of food. It can survive a lack of nutrients; it cannot survive without food.
A. - Because of moisture. There are some flowers that do rot, and those that do not, which have a different moisture. Vegetables, with a lot more moisture, are more prone to rotting.
It is not yet known with certainty, but the most popular explanation is that when serotonin levels are manipulated, it affects the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is the control center for other hormones. The control of these hormones is also affected and then the other hormones are not active for arousal and orgasm.
They are usually muscle relaxants. The pupil is a muscle, and when it contracts, it constricts. The eyedrops relax the muscle, and the pupil dilates.
We can. The main danger is iron poisoning. You'd have to drink a lot of very rusty water to get that sick. If you see the water has a reddish tinge, don't drink it. If it's not so dirty it tinges, it's not dirty enough to hurt you. (But different people react differently.) Besides, the inside and the outside of pipes rust at different rates because of all the factors that affect rusting. So a pipe might be quite rusty on the outside and still clean on the inside, depending on those factors. That's why a rusty pipe doesn't always mean rusty water.
It's not the blood vessels as such that are different, although they are. The brain's blood vessels have some special features, but the blood-brain barrier is mainly associated with a type of cell called an astrocyte. The astrocyte has processes called feet that stick to the blood vessel and wrap around its external wall. In most of the brain's blood vessels, this layer of astrocytes forming a physical barrier. Any substance that wants to enter a neuron or other brain cell must first pass through an astrocyte. There are exceptions to this rule. The pineal gland, the hypothalamus and some areas of the brainstem are for instance directly connected to the bloodstream and don't have a blood-brain barrier. Here's a good illustration of how astrocyte feet help form the blood-brain barrier. It shows how astrocytes essentially get to decide what is allowed into the brain and what isn't. Some substances are allowed in without the need for astrocytes to get involved (e.g. small molecules that are often fat soluble), but others (e.g. glucose) must be actively transported across. Many medicines and toxins don't have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier because they are too large or aren't sufficiently fat soluble (lipophobic). In general, astrocytes normally allow nutrients to get through while blocking most other substances from getting to neurones and other brain cells. Note: in the interests of precision, the blood-brain barrier is not solely formed by astrocytes. Other cells are also involved. As mentioned in another answer, the blood vessel's endothelial cells are also important. Another type of cell involved is the pericyte. But the astrocytes are the main cellular link between the brain's neurones and the bloodstream. The astrocytes are not unique to the brain.
They are green because of the chlorophyll. It is a greenish-yellow chemical which absorbs light and makes use of the light-energy to work in a chemical reaction, thereby producing food which is used by the tree. When the sunlight decreases, the amount of food necessary to keep the leaves alive is no longer sufficient to increase the growth of the tree. The tree therefore sheds those leaves which do not produce food. The green color of the leaf fades and the underlying structure reveals itself. The structure of maple trees is red, that of oak trees is yellow and so on. It all depends on the structure of the tree as to whether the tree has red hair or black hair, for the tree is of the same structure.
That’s the same reason we love sugar and sugary things. Sugar is like one of the best things to eat, because it’s so easy to digest and for your cells to use. Ants also need food, and simple sugars are a good one for them.
being high = more happy chemicals in the brain more happy chemicals in the brain = feeling happier feeling happier = things are better, no separation between mind and body, when you’re high, your body’s high too, and whatever you’re doing will be enhanced to some degree. Music sounds better, movies are more exciting, candy tastes sweeter. As to why or how things make you high, that’s another question.
"Your brain is a muscle. Your brain is not a muscle. This statement is a metaphor, not a physiological truth, and physiological rules cannot be applied." I've been told not to use my brain. Don't read, don't do puzzles, don't watch documentaries, because it's thinking. The brain has been injured after a concussion. And what he needs is not physical therapy but rest like a broken bone. If you use it too much while it's healing, it may slow down the healing or cause damage, just like a broken bone. The reasons why are not yet clear, but it has been scientifically proven that brain rest after injury accelerates recovery. However, a recent study shows that light puzzles and thinking, starting from the first few days, can prevent psychological disorders such as depression.
- This is a consequence of the fact that you are regularly breaking your REM, and this shortened sleep wakes you up in such a way that you do not go through the REM cycle. Remembering your dreams – and particularly when you are aware that you have just had one when you wake up – then you are very likely to be breaking your REM, and that is why you feel tired. The REM cycle is very important and healthy, but having two and a half cycles is better than one, even though you wake up feeling more rested after the second.
The kidneys regulate the fluid in the blood. The kidneys also secrete the hormone erythropoietin, which tells the stem cells in the marrow to make more blood. So the kidneys regulate the fluid in the blood and the production of blood, but the pressure comes from the fluid, not the production of blood.
Unlike us, who can eat when we want and do what we want, elephants probably spend most of their time eating. Taking bites as big as a whole round of pizza.
Your body produces two kinds of cholesterol—the good kind and the bad kind. The bad kind tends to stick to the walls of the arteries and gradually clog them. If you get a blood test, it will tell you how much of each kind you have in your blood. If your HDL is high, that's good, because it means your body is removing cholesterol from your blood and transporting it back to your liver to be recycled. But if your LDL is high, that's bad, because the more of this bad cholesterol you have in your blood, the greater the chance it will clot your arteries and cause a heart attack or stroke.
It depends on the age of the person. In children, neuroplasticity makes it possible to rewire some of the functions lost with the tumor. Immans. The older we get, the less this ability is effective. In practice, we might expect to see some long-term loss of function associated with the lobe to which the tumor was attached.
However, in some respects the answer is no. During the time that you are symptomatic, the amount of the pathogens (such as the bacilli or the virus) in your system, which your body is already producing, is far higher than the amount that you are inhaling from your sick roommate, by a magnitude. We are talking about millions or billions of times more than you could get from your roommate.
Your body has an enormous influence on your feelings. A spooky movie can give you a heart attack, a sugar pill can cure a disease if you think it will, and depression and anxiety have profound physical effects. Your body produces a host of chemicals, carries nerve signals, and determines how you see, hear, think, and experience. Your heart breaking isn't even the most dramatic thing that your body can do to itself.
It’s not terrible at all. When you think about it, peanut butter was invented as a way to help those who were malnourished. Of course, there’s a whole shitload of carbs in a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich, but if you eat it by itself, it’s not like you’re eating a pile of crap.
It’s because you didn’t clean them thoroughly enough. It has soaked into the sponge and has found its way into every crevice and tiny corner of the whole thing.
Strength is not directly proportional to height and weight. However, when two people of equal strength fight, the taller and heavier of the two will have the advantage. The greater the height, the greater the reach. If you and I both strike at the same time, my blow will reach you first. More weight will allow a striker to pack more power behind his punches and kicks. A heavier man will also be stronger because it's harder for him to get up from the ground. This, of course, is assuming that the two men are equally skilled in the martial arts.
It’s that synovial fluid. It’s like a grease between the bones that lubricates the joints.
[ELI5] There are two reasons for this. First, for the cheeses that you can eat moldy, like blue cheese, there are very special molds, which are cultivated like other food and mixed in with the cheese. It's not just a random mold. These are known to be safe and are used to add a specific aroma and flavor. Second, for other cheeses, if there is a mold on a block, you can cut it off and eat the rest, because block cheese is harder and more solid. The mold does not penetrate very deeply into the cheese, so you can cut it and eat it.
Yes, mainly by hereditary modification. Chickens that lay eggs (and therefore reproduce) much faster than their wild ancestors have been bred. This was done by breeding the most prolific layers, and culling the less productive. Repeat many times over, and after many generations, you get a chicken that reproduces incredibly fast compared to its wild ancestors. The problem with this is that it takes time to put in and take out these traits, and if a species is nearly extinct it may not last long enough for the reproduction rate to be increased, or there may not be enough of it left. When they do reproduce like bunnies, you have to start culling them to slow down their reproduction, or they’ll spread everywhere. Theoretically, the same thing could be done with plants, but trees, for example, have very long generation times, which would mean it would take too long to get this trait (high CO2 uptake and growth).
A headache is a symptom. The headache in itself can't hurt you, but the cause of the headache can. The headache is just as real as any other feeling. They are purely chemical signals, and they can in theory be measured. (And the same goes for any feeling or thought.)
If you have received an organ from someone, any organ, you are not allowed to donate organs yourself. So this is not the case.
: The loss of the ability to accommodate is not due to the weakness of the eye muscle, but to the loss of the elasticity of the lens. The lens is a naturally elastic thing, it likes to accommodate. But the lens is surrounded by elastic cords, which tend to flatten it. When we contract the accommodation muscle, it does not directly compress the lens, it only relaxes the tension of the cords and makes the lens more elastic. But as we grow older, the lens loses its elasticity and consequently its power of accommodation. It is like the skin, which becomes more and more loose as one grows older.
I think the main point is that cells can’t divide and reproduce indefinitely. While it’s true that we’ve evolved to die and are programmed to die, there is a biochemistry behind senescent cells. The problem is damage to the DNA of our cells. To repair that damage, your cells need to be able to produce the appropriate new molecules. It would be like maintaining a 3D printer by 3D printing new replacement parts for it when its motors, nozzles, and gears wear out. Besides, if your 3D printer breaks down completely, you can always 3D print a new one with your other 3D printer. But in order to do that, you need the design files that the printer uses to produce the parts you need. If those files are corrupted in one of the printers, it won’t be able to make the replacement part that it needs. If the file is only slightly damaged, the printer might still be able to make a part that almost works, but it won’t be perfect. And when you keep replacing parts, even with new parts from different printers, the replacement parts are produced from the corrupted files, so they will function less and less well. Why can’t cells repair their own DNA? You know, they actually do repair it a lot. But their means of detecting damage aren’t perfect, and so some damage will always get through. It might look like it’s undamaged to the repair-related molecules. Or, the damage might occur on the gene that makes the repair-related molecules, and the cell won’t be able to detect the damage at all. Or, the gene itself might get damaged and broken. But sooner or later, the damage will always accumulate, and the cell’s ability to detect and repair damage will weaken, until it becomes impossible to repair the damage and the cells are forced to make do with flawed new molecules. In general, damage to the DNA comes from three main sources. The first is mutations from carcinogens and radiation. These directly damage the DNA. As I said, your cells have a lot of means of detecting and repairing such damage, or else they will self-destruct so that they don’t pass on the damage to their offspring. But that’s not perfect, either. That sort of catastrophic damage leads to cancer, but even if the cell doesn’t become cancerous, it might not be able to function as well as it should. The second source of damage is errors that occur during DNA synthesis. The DNA is a huge and complex molecule, and the genes that make the molecules used to copy it are themselves imperfect. Your cells have many means of avoiding such errors and correcting them when they happen, but, again, there are times when those means fail, and an error occurs. Such an error could add, delete, move, or change the base pairs, and one or both of the new daughter cells, in consequence, will have the flawed file. And if that file is on an essential gene, the cell can’t produce the corresponding necessary component and can’t function properly. The third source is more complex, and it has to do with the way the cell copies its DNA. It seems that the cell makes an enzyme that unravels the double helix. Then, another enzyme or maybe two or more—it’s complicated—takes one of the two ends of the double helix and adds new base pairs to it, so that one end of the new double helix has the old base pairs and the other end has the new ones. But the “snap back” mechanism needs a starting point. It can’t start from the very end. That starting point is like the tab on a zipper, which you need to pull the zipper up. The little tab is not copied by the enzyme. That means that some of the original DNA is lost, because it doesn’t get copied. The ends of the DNA have little additions called telomeres that are there solely for the purpose of getting the attention of the “snap back” mechanism and being copied. But they code for nothing, so it doesn’t matter that the new cells lose them. The cells start out with a lot of them and they gradually get lost. The cells that reproduce very quickly, like skin cells, eventually get so low on telomeres that they start losing parts of the actual DNA when they copy. When your cells first divide during embryogenesis, they make an enzyme that adds more telomeres, so that they don’t run out too early. But in adolescence, that gene is switched off, the ensuing absence of that enzyme causes the loss of the telomeres. Why? Well, as others have said, we’ve evolved to die. As you get older, you become more vulnerable to disease, predation, and cancer, so you can’t afford to keep making telomeres. You’ve also evolved to die, so that your offspring won’t be adversely affected by having to provide you with more of their resources, which would decrease the likelihood that they’ll survive to reproduce and pass on your genes. In short, your cells need the files to build the components they need in order to repair themselves and the rest of your body. Eventually, as you age, the damage to the DNA accumulates to the point where the cells no longer have the files they need to make the necessary components, and the cells start aging.
Cholesterol is like the word Christian. There are a lot of Christian denominations, and there are also a lot of different kinds of cholesterin. LDL is bad, and is found in food containing a lot of saturated or trans fat. The main culprits are smoked meat, full-fat dairy, butter and fat sausage. And it is this kind of fat that clogs arteries and can lead to heart attacks and strokes. The good kind of fat is HDL, and it is found in food such as eggs, fatty fish, shellfish and oatmeal. This is the kind of fat that, as it were, acts as a gentleman usher. It will go up to the LDL and say, “Please step away from the arteries, and follow me instead.” And then it will take the LDL into a dark room (the liver) and fuck it. The liver produces its own HDL, but if the amount of LDL is too great, the liver will not be able to keep up and then you are at risk. As in all things in life, moderation and balance are the way to go. (N.B. Editing)
[EL4] There are two things that matter: how much energy is there in the walking thing, and how much energy does it use walking? Fat is a good way of storing energy. True, it takes longer to turn energy in fat into movement than if you used batteries, but still... It can be done. Fat can store 10 kilowatt-hours per kilogram, batteries only 2,5; and fat is distributed all over the human body, batteries only in one place, so the human has much more room for "battery" than the robot. So a human has much more energy in him than the robot of the same size. And since humans are made of meat and bone, about as heavy as water, and robots of much heavier metal, a robot of the same size is heavier than a human. The heavier the walking thing, the more energy it needs to walk. Besides, human walking is actually quite smooth and rhythmic. The first step is made, you get into a rhythm, and then most of the body moves with the help of inertia. The muscles don't do much, they just correct the small deviations of the step. When you want to take a step, you just lift your leg a little, bend your knees and then your leg goes on swinging like a pendulum for free. But robots don't know that. They have to accelerate and decelerate their whole leg for each step, and that's a waste of energy.
Sound is heard by the sensation of a change in air pressure. A very loud noise like an explosion can produce such a pressure that the ear drum is stretched beyond its elasticity and bursts.
Human brains are pattern-matching machines. When a memory is fragmented or incomplete, our brain fills in the gaps with something that makes sense. Even if you do remember something one way, that doesn’t mean it actually happened that way.
mirror and eye gazing is a special topic, because it can cause “anomalous perceptions” even in healthy people. ([Mirror- and Eye Gazing: An Integrative Review of Induced Altered and Anomalous Experiences. (Mirror- and Eye Gazing: An Integrative Review of Induced Altered and Anomalous Experiences.
One difference is the number of chromosomes. The horse has 64, the donkey has 62, you cross them and get a mule with 63. The odd number means sterility.
Try not to think like a human being for a while. Instead of the most powerful supercomputer in the world, think of the brain the size of a rice-grain. It has no concept of thinking, nor does it have any feelings, nor memories. Now you are a fish. Now you see other fish. Now the other fish fits into your mouth, so it is food. Whether it is a relative or not, you don't recognize or remember it. You live only by instinct, and instinct says you eat something that fits in your mouth.
They don’t have any silk in their bodies. It is a liquid that they constantly produce in their silk glands and it turns into silk when it touches the air. One very small drop is enough.
They contain isoflavones, which may be dangerous. But for that to have any effect, you would have to eat unbelievable amounts of soy. In excessive amounts everything is bad.
Firstly, you are still your parents' child, because there are still some egg and sperm cells in you. All the cells in you, new and old, come from that original fertilized egg. Your DNA and cells have not been made independent of them. Secondly, not all cells are replaced every seven years, it is just an average. For example, brain and nerve cells live longer, while the lining of the stomach changes every fortnight. Thirdly, the more complicated answer is: A fertilized egg splits into two cells. These cells are no longer the original fertilized egg, but are the offspring of the original cell. They divide again and so on and so forth, for a number of generations, and then the cells are ‘great-great-great-grandchildren’ of the fertilized egg. They then start to take on the properties of the body cells they are descended from and form your body. Any cell in you is a descendent of the first egg and sperm, even if it is replaced.
“Gut biome” means the culture of bacteria living in the intestine. They are essential for the digestion of food, and send us chemical messages. When you often eat a particular food or group of similar foods, you also feed the microbes that feed on them. They multiply and multiply at the expense of other bacteria, and your body adapts to eating those kinds of foods. You will start to feel a desire for foods that you have often eaten because your gut biome has been adapted to digest them.
The outermost layer of skin, the epidermis, is the layer that sloughs off. The deep layer of skin is the dermis, and that doesn’t slough off. Cut that and it doesn’t regenerate. And tattoos are in the dermis as well, which is why they last so long.
Our primitive instincts have developed over the last billion years of life. In the last hundred thousand years we have become conscious. It will take some time for us to get rid of them.
Generally, reptiles produce more offspring than mammals, and they reproduce by laying eggs. Animals in eggs are more subject to the influences of their environment, and the embryo inside is more vulnerable to external influences. Two heads, also called bicephaly, can also result from an embryo splitting into two (this is how a twin is formed), but sometimes they do not split all the way, and this is how a chimera is formed.
2x2 means 2+2. 2x2 simply means “two times 2,” and that’s the definition of multiplication. Also, 2x2 is just “two times 2,” which means 2+2. None of these things are eccentricities or curious properties. They are simply instances of what we have defined these terms to mean.
They are like little flakes of glitter rather than like insects. You may try to contain them on your body, but they will spread. But you forget that your body is already covered with flakes of germs and that it’s only a question of which ones survive and start reproducing.
We don't know for sure, but the most popular theory is that it's myofascial release. Your muscle is made up of individual fibers, and the fascia is like a web that surrounds each individual fiber and the entire muscle. The fibers can get tangled and stuck together, causing those infamous muscle knots that we love so much. Slow pressure on the foam roller (and you should use it slowly) can loosen those knots.
It’s a real thing. Upper GI bleeding. Severe bleeding from a burst blood vessel in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum can cause hematemesis—vomiting blood. Of course, in the movies, they exaggerate the amount of blood, but yes, it’s possible. Besides violence, there are lots of other causes of hematemesis, such as liver cirrhosis, gastric ulcers (which can also lead to cancer), and aneurysms. And you can also cough so hard you tear your esophagus and bleed from it.
Because the body adapts to the use of the parts. If you tear them, you get a hard scar. This tearing is a largely microscopic one, and means to the body: "Hey! This muscle fails when you lift this weight, and you lift this weight again and again. I have to strengthen it, because you constantly take on increased loads and these tears are dangerous." When you beat it, it means: "This place gets a lot of blunt force and macroscopical shock. I have to harden and protect it like a shell, and it hardens with a scar. This is not to say that it is absolutely bad to do this occasionally or in small doses. This is exactly what massage, stretching, myofascial release does, but to a lesser extent. It just won't work like lifting weights.
Because a bone cannot be exercised; it is only the muscles connected to it that can be exercised. When you say that your knee is injured, it is usually not the knee itself but the muscles or the ligaments attached to the knee.
You run out of radiator fluid and electrical eletrolytes. Then you overheat, and eventually your brain fries. If you recognize the symptoms, they’re reversible. You die if you don’t. Drink water, get salt in you. Get cooled down, and you’re fine. If you don’t get cooled down, you die. If you drink too much water, you die. When I got it, I went down in the barn. I couldn’t walk. My father drove me home. I got some salt, drank some water, and I ate some peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwiches. I got cooled down in the cellar, and I was fine in half an hour. If I had stayed in the field, I’d have been dead in an hour. You don’t always know you’re overheating. It has to come over you.
A hundred thousand strands of cabling, each thinner than a human hair, all looking exactly the same, and all cut off. Now you have to rejoin them one by one. But how do you know which goes where, and how do you find them without damaging them further? If you can solve these three problems, you'll be a millionaire.
It is called a uvula, and one of its functions is to lubricate the throat by rubbing against it. Patients who have had their uvula removed (which is a perfectly safe operation) often complain of dryness of the throat.
Supplements generally don't contain fats, fats, and carbohydrates, except for some very special ones like fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids). If you "supplement" your suplements (heh!) with sufficient calories in the form of carbs, fats, and fats, you can survive. But then it's a regular diet and not a "supplement diet".
I don't know where the idea came from that inbreeding is some sort of impassable obstacle to reproduction. Of course it's not an optimum thing and it leads to a slight reduction in fitness of the offspring, but it is successful reproduction and will soon enough expand the gene pool, so that inbreeding is not a problem after a few generations. It is what it is. Sometimes you have no choice.
the longer the telomeres, the more times a cell can divide. But if a cell divides many times, there’s a greater chance of errors in the division process, and that causes cancer.
These scales send a faint, harmless electric current through the body and then measure the amount of current returning to the scale. Fat, muscle and water all respond differently to the current by either absorbing it or conducting it.
First, the common cold isn't caused by one single virus, but rather 200-some, with rhinoviruses accounting for 35 percent of all colds. So there's no single "cold virus" to be vaccinated against. And second, the common cold is just not that important—it's not very deadly or serious, and lots of people catch it regularly and get better just fine. So research efforts are directed at much greater threats.
Animals are often given preventive antibiotics. This is problematic for two main reasons: one, it means that they can be kept in worse conditions, and can be crowded together and kept in less clean conditions. Secondly, overuse of antibiotics can have other effects. They can end up in the water and environment. They can lead to the development of resistant bacteria. If animals are treated well, they may still need or benefit from occasional antibiotics if they get sick. Unfortunately, labeling does not distinguish between these.
As you may know, sleep cycles are generally 90 minutes long. Waking up in the middle of one leaves you feeling tired and sometimes foggy-brained. One of the best ways to avoid this is to set your alarm clock an hour or so before you normally get up. This will put you in a new sleep cycle. So when you wake up at the right time, you’ll have already completed a sleep cycle.
What dangers are you talking about? Today, we don’t have to face the dangers of a hundred years ago—we have ready access to medical help in case of illness or injury, we have the option of treatment for many ailments, we don’t have to work with large farm animals, we have reliable means of heating that don’t produce harmful fumes. Women have access to prenatal care throughout their pregnancy and, if necessary, they can have surgical intervention, not to mention a clean place to give birth if they choose to. So are you thinking of some particular danger?
The body constantly produces heat. Heat is also lost through the skin to the external environment. The rate of loss depends on the external factors, such as temperature, clothes, etc. If heat is produced more rapidly than it is lost, one feels hot. If heat is lost more rapidly than it is produced, one feels cold. If heat production and heat loss are about equal, one feels comfortable. If you sleep in a room that is 21°C, you may feel cold because heat is escaping from your body more rapidly than it is being produced. You will then go and lie down under a thick blanket. You will be better insulated under the blanket, and the heat you produce will now be lost more slowly than it is produced. Now you will feel quite warm, and will then raise one leg out from under the blanket. You will now lose heat slowly from the part of the body covered by the blanket, and from a small part of your body. You will thus establish a balance between heat production and heat loss.
Evolution. It was a survival mechanism of our ancestors to collect useful objects and things. Now that we have advanced to a stage in our evolution where scarcity of resources is no longer a problem, we instinctively keep objects that we find attractive.
; The breaks do not help. So the confusion may be due to the fact that sunburn is not about temperature, so it will not help you at all if you "allow the skin to cool." It's about the radiation hitting and damaging the skin, and that damage will start to affect even after 10 minutes in the sun. So as long as your breaks mean you will be in the sun for a total of 4 hours over several days, it will not help.
Why do you think all night party makeup is good? Makeup is bad for the skin. The longer you have it, the worse it is. If you put your face on the pillow for eight hours, it rubs the makeup, it's worse. Sleeping all night is bad, partying all night is still bad.
Nothing. No significant force is being applied to a person who is between two repulsing magnets. The only force is between the magnets. The area between them is not affected unless a magnet is placed there. A magnetic field is not a physical field. When they interact, they do not create anything physical.
A "water pill" does the opposite of what you think. It makes you pee, which makes you lose water.
I'm no doctor, but it seems to me the feet have a lot of blood circulation, but little fat. Heat escapes through the feet. It's the same with the head. I don't know if this is really true, but someone once told me if you want to keep your ears warm, put your socks on.
It is not a pile of noodles inside you. It is attached to the so-called mesentery. There is a picture on the mesentery and how it is attached to the intestine. It is a little bloody, but no blood.
some humans, not all. Most people are interested in what technology can do for them, but not in how it does it. Good cameramen are interested in the camera only in so far as it helps them to take the picture they want to take. Most people aren’t interested in how mobile phones work, but they are very interested in what they can do with them to communicate. I’m not at all interested in organic chemistry and biology, but I am very interested in how vaccines can keep me alive.
Who’s going to tell me?
salt water cleans the inflamed throat tissues and gives the symptomatic relief. Salt water is also good for disinfection and is anti-bacterial, thus shortening the duration of a sore throat. Unfortunately, it is not possible to clean the throat properly, as the gag reflex and the whole mouth gets in the way. It is the most thorough cleaning if the liquid is moved and then rolled, and gargling makes the liquid go down deeper. Sitting and holding water in the back of the throat is not removing the mucus. That's the whole idea of salt water gargling.
The phlegm has somehow gotten into the wrong “pipe.” There is a flap in the back of the throat that opens and closes and that lets the air go down to the lungs when you inhale and lets the food go down to the stomach when you swallow. It normally does that automatically, but sometimes it makes a mistake.
No one can say for sure. It is only their best guess, with the information they have.
The gist of it is that it's pretty solid and difficult to break down in the blood. That's why they accumulate in the arteries and get clogged, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke.
A weed is any plant growing where it’s not wanted. A rose bush in a wheat field is a weed, and so is a wheat plant in a flower bed. There is only so much land where everything can grow. When you are trying to grow food, you don’t want other plants to come in and take water and space from the ones you are trying to grow.
A beautiful thing about the electromagnetic spectrum is that a moving current can generate a magnetic field, and a moving magnetic field can generate a current. This is something you learn about in high school physics. TMS uses a coil that creates a magnetic field that is either flipped or jiggled, which causes a current to flow in the brain. The current is really small, but it has a temporary effect on how your brain functions, because the way your brain communicates is through a combination of electrical and chemical signals. We don't understand it all yet—because we don't understand how depression works—but it is quite safe and has temporary and beneficial effects on depression.
Cells whose genetic mutation enables them to multiply without rest, unlike normal cells. At least that’s what it comes down to.
- Have you ever had a cat? It can suddenly turn on you without any reason. It is instinct. Tigers and lions are simply larger cats. They may be playing with you and then turn on you.
Plant-based foods, even if they are high in fat, don’t have cholesterol because only animal cells produce it. What your doctor is telling you to control is something you can control: external dietary cholesterol. It is much harder to control the source within you, the one that comes from your own cells.
The difference between BMR and TDEE is activity level. You are right. The BMR is the number of calories your body burns just to exist. The maintenance calorie number is the number of calories you must eat in order not to lose or gain weight. If the two calculators give different results, because you are not sure of your activity level, what should you do? They are just estimates to get you started. You can see it right in the activity level description - moderately active, for example, is about training 3-5 days a week. But it is obvious that you do not burn the same number of calories by training 3 days a week as you do by training 5 days a week. Pick up the estimates you think fit best for you. As long as you are not completely rotten, most people can start with "moderately active". Get a scale and weigh your food so you really know how many calories you eat. Guessing is always wrong. Weigh yourself and register your weight. If you do not lose, maintain or gain in accordance with your goals after a couple of weeks, then adjust your calories up or down. You do not experience such a large change in weight within two weeks, so this is a safe way to do it. And it is also the most accurate way, because each body responds differently to food and exercise.
Not a healthy fish, but a decomposing fish. That's why the top-quality fish market smells like...nothing. The smell of fishy fish is not good.
Your stomach acid is one of the many ways your body breaks down food into nutrients. You can chew your food as well as you like, but it’s no good if you end up with bits of meat in your blood. You have to break it down into smaller nutrients that your body can use. Normally it doesn’t hurt you because your stomach mucous secretion produces a hard lining that resists the acid. It’s not easy for stomach acid to break through this, and it takes a bit of time for the acid to break down the food. Normally your stomach produces a small amount of acid, which does its work and then is carried on by the rest of your system. But if your body doesn’t produce the mucous lining properly, your stomach acid can begin to break down your tissues. That can be a cause of stomach ulcers, and you can be treated by avoiding the foods that make your body produce too much acid. Also, if your stomach is too full or if you produce too much acid, it can get pushed up higher in the gullet into your oesophagus. The mucous lining isn’t there yet, and so the acid can damage your oesophagus. This is what we call acid indigestion, and it can be quite painful. If you’re prone to it, you have to be careful not to overeat, and don’t eat just before going to bed, and avoid the foods that make you produce too much acid. So it does dissolve you from the inside. But it takes a lot longer than you might think, and it hurts so much that you’re likely to go to a doctor and get treated before you need emergency surgery.
It’s double damage. The cells in your hands are already so overloaded by the cold that any additional pain is exaggerated. For instance, if you have a little cut on your hand and then you touch it, you feel pain. Extra pain. And instead of being a visible wound, it’s invisible—because cold damage is invisible. (If you want to fix it, warm up your hands and use a good hand cream once they aren’t frozen any more.) (That will help the cells recharge.)
Your body is a hormone playground between ages 13 and 25. These hormones help you go through puberty, grow up, and develop your brain. But they also make your pores a little overactive, which causes sweating and such. Then after age 25 they start balancing out until the mid-thirties, when they start to go down.
They puff up their feathers and trap the air inside, using their skin to warm it up. Birds are good fliers so they have a higher capacity for preserving body heat. And since they have a lower body temperature than mammals, fewer calories are needed to warm them up. They also form flocks and gather in small groups to keep warm. They also bask in the sun and find little burrows to live in during the winter. Some birds like robins fly south to avoid harsh winters.
The time and person are different. Some vomit in the night, some vomit in the morning. Some people get diarrhea. Some people get headaches.
Your body functions best when it has the right balance of water and salt. That's why in hospitals they administer salt solution instead of simple water. Take away too much salt without supplying an equal amount of water, you'll be in trouble. And too much water without an equal amount of salt will upset the balance too. If there were no salt in your sweat, by sweating you would be increasing the amount of salt in your body, and that wouldn't be good.
food poisoning and food poisoning are not the same. In food poisoning, the bacilli are growing in the food, and are releasing their toxins into the food. Then the food poisoning is caused by the bacilli in the food when you eat it. This is what will get you sick quickly. In many cases, cooking does not eliminate the poison, but kills the bacilli. This is what takes longer, because the bacilli have to multiply a lot inside you before you can get the symptoms. The salmonella and the e-coli are examples of this. Sometimes the symptoms do not occur for several days, and they are generally longer.
I work out six or seven days a week. I do a full-body weight training. My legs used to be jelly for days after the leg lifts, but now even after a 454-pound squat or a 325-pound deadlift I don't get weak or sore anymore, unless I walk up a few flights of stairs. Basically, the blood supply to the muscles increases after the heavy training, which is good for the repair and recovery. If you stay hydrated and do your work outs regularly, you don't have DOMS. Except if you're constantly going up in weight.
Because you’re focusing on them. Your brain is very good at ignoring information that it doesn’t need. For example, you’re constantly looking at your nose, but your brain is perfectly capable of not noticing it because it’s just extraneous information. By concentrating on a particular sound, you force your brain to ignore other noises.
1 hat, 2 hats, they are the same. No, really, a doctor has a doctorate in medicine and is capable of performing higher functions and duties. A nurse has a smaller educational background and cannot perform as many of these functions, but can perform a wide range of tasks, and this is what makes the medical field work. A doctor has done more schooling, and can therefore perform more functions and duties.
'Why' is a misleading word in many branches of science, and biology especially. It assumes a definite purpose, when the chances are that the form under consideration is merely the result of a random mutation. We do not know if one-lunged animals could have gotten by, because the only way we know that it has been done is with two.
Fat, or rather triglycerides, consist of a glycerol backbone to which are attached three fatty acids. To oxidize fat, these fatty acids are broken off the backbone, and then combined with oxygen to form acetyl coenzyme A, a substance also used in the burning of sugar. And then this acetyl coenzyme A enters the citric acid cycle, from which it enters a series of reactions that produce a molecule of adenosine triphosphate, the main store of energy in the body. The complete list of reactions involved is enormous, as it often is in biochemistry.
Not so much “know,” as “only those animals that are resistant to or develop resistance to the snake venom are able to survive, to pass on their hunting behavior to their offspring and to continue the species.” And those that are not resistant and who instead stay away from the snakes pass on their behavior of staying away from snakes to their offspring.
Raising the hairs, as we used to do, has a number of uses: 1. It keeps a layer of air still against the skin, which adds another insulating layer; 2. It makes you bigger. When you are scared, it is good to make yourself big. 3. It is a pleasure. When you enjoy music or watch a good movie scene, you get goosebumps. We don't really know what the relationship is between the shiver and the music or the good movie scenes. But it is because the part of the brain that enjoys music is very close to the part that looks for danger. 4. It is an evacuation. We don't know why, but it could be because the temperature suddenly drops a little when you pee or poop.
The shell contains a carotenoid pigment called astaxanthin. This is the same pigment that gives salmon its color. When the shell is not cooked, the astaxanthin pigment is covered with a protein layer, which gives the shell its color of bluish-gray. When this layer is destroyed by heat, the astaxanthin molecules are released and the color of the shellfish is changed.
They follow the same course as internal skeletons. They go into the coffin, and are dug out with the bones, after the body has had time to rot. This is a curious fact. Here in Portugal, gravediggers steal prostheses because they are made of precious metals, formerly, and now usually, a kind of platinum.
There is some control of this sort of thing via the spinal cord, but there is also the vagus nerve, which controls much of it. Also the heart and the stomach can continue to function without being connected to anything at a basic level. Breathing is the hardest, and patients with severe spinal cord injuries can require breathing assistance. But this is usually the result of a severe injury and one that usually means immediate death. This does occur, but it is subject to some selection bias in that the people who survive to become paralysed are the ones who have had comparatively mild injuries.
Because the human body can't digest it. In order to make use of the kilojoules in food, the body must be able to digest it. Petrol is not a nutrient for the human body.
I don’t think your premise is quite accurate. It’s a very wide scale, you’re simplifying things too much. Besides mosquitoes, can you think of any other insects where the female is far more aggressive than the male? And I’m not keen on going up against a female hyena or a mama grizzly either. I think the trend here is that insects don’t raise their young (generalizing here), but rather just give birth to thousands of babies and hope for the best. And mammals are a little more patient, but raise fewer young for a longer period. So the trend here is for insects to reproduce as much as possible, so the males are just sperm machines and the females are just egg machines. Sperm is a cheap and easy thing to produce, but it takes a lot of energy to produce thousands of eggs. So the females need a lot of nutritious food, and the female mosquito, for example, feeds on blood because it contains tons of sugar and protein for the eggs. But the male mosquito doesn’t drink blood; he just keeps flying around, impregnating as many females as he can. But with mammals, raising young takes the female out of the hunting-gathering role, because she’s concentrating on raising young. And that’s why the males are the ones out there, and the females are hidden in burrows or somewhere out of sight. But this is a really broad trend and can’t be taken as a universal truth. Each animal is unique.
Neurotransmitters like you're talking about is essentially impossible even if you make huge concessions. There are a number of reasons for this. First of all, because of the enormous number of functions a substance like dopamine plays in the body. Not only in the classic "reward circuit" but also in the general mood, in the digestion, in the breast milk, in the kidneys, even in the immune system. To explain how and why it acts in all these places, it would take a semester of university to explain. Like all transmitters, dopamine can be subject to positive and negative feedback depending on the circumstances and the type of receptor. In other words, in the reward circuit, the more the signal is stimulated, the more dopamine is required to trigger the signal again. But in other places, such as the general mood or breastfeeding, exactly the opposite can happen... up to a point (then down-regulation plays a role and we get back into too much complication.) Third, dopamine production and reaction vary considerably from person to person and, as I hinted at, even over time in the same person. Dopamine acts on the condition of the receptors and this can be surprisingly varied, even if the basic functions are the same (see 1). Fourth, we do not understand this completely! Most of the effects of neurotransmitters are assumed on the basis of our experience with drugs that act like a certain transmitter and our observation of the reactions of the drug. There is a lot of guesswork on our part in the matter of brain chemistry, especially in matters that are as subjective as mood. I know this is a lot to say for an answer that does not exist, but I think it is important that you understand why the answers to this question may be either oversimplified, unsatisfactory or overcomplicated. This is the nature of this area of biology.
Life is not a state of on and off in a cell, it is a combination of factors and events. But probably the simplest answer to your question is at the molecular level, that is: to break the DNA into the bases, to break the enzymes into the amino acids, and so on. You will have organic compounds, but not a structure that can perform a particular function or role.
I will add to the other answers that have already been given: Before our recent time, people were used to walking around barefoot, and if you had thick soles you couldn’t feel the ground underneath you. So maybe the many nerve endings were put there to feel important ground conditions through the thick soles.
The back of the skull is not so strong as the front of the skull, and there are delicate parts of the brain and spine in the skull. Consequently, when the back of the skull is struck, the delicate parts of the brain and spine are damaged more than if it were struck in the front of the skull. Also, a very strong strike in the front and sides of the head may also cause brain damage. There are a number of ways in which the brain can be injured, such as from a blow or from shaking. One kind of brain damage is known as a concussion, but there are a lot of them.
This is a matter of taste, and it cannot be objectively stated. For my part, I like a glass of water first thing when I wake up.
We have no innate knowledge of any language. If there were no other humans around you, you would not know human language. But you have a genetic propensity for learning to walk. Unless you have some physical handicap, you are almost sure to learn to walk.
Lack of sleep causes the blood vessels in the skin around the eyes to dilate and so the blood circulation there increases. The skin under the eyes is very thin, so what you see is nothing more than an increase in the amount of blood under the skin.
I'm not sure how you imagine the appearance of DNA. But it's just a molecule, like water or CO2, only much more complex and different for each person. It is not in the DNA to be seen. These letters are just the means of describing the matter of DNA, it is not that they are there. For example, C = cytosine, G = guanine, A = adenine, and T = thymine, and these are the four different chemicals that are in the DNA. There were no other letters. For example, a person could be described with AALLHT: Arm, arm, arm, leg, leg, head, body.
Radiation splits the DNA in a healthy cell. Then a mutant swarm forms in the body. But if this mutant swarm is exposed to additional radiation, it is killed and its genetic material is destroyed.
We only use 20–30 percent of the oxygen we breathe, and it's usually to stimulate breathing or to clear the water.
I’m no expert, but I think it’s more a question of learning to slow down one’s heartbeat and other functions in order to save oxygen, rather than of having bigger lungs. You can also strengthen your lungs. People who play musical instruments that have to draw air from the lungs, like flutes, generally have bigger lungs, I think.
It seems that you are mixing up a few words. I believe what you are talking about is so-called “lab-grown” meat. These are cells that have grown in the laboratory and never been a part of a living animal. They have, in essence, cultivated muscle tissue in a Petri dish. As far as the outside goes, it is exactly the same as meat that comes from an animal. If many people ate it and there were many laboratories to produce it, it could become a game changer.
Proteins are long chains of the building blocks of life – amino acids. But they are not merely long strings, they fold in really complex ways and it seems that the folding pattern has a great influence on their function. The way they fold is not random – each protein always folds in the same way unless something goes wrong – but exactly what makes a newly formed protein fold in a particular way remains unknown. It is assumed to be related to the order of the amino acids in the chain but, as yet, we have no means of predicting the folding of a particular chain of amino acids. Therefore, we do not know what will happen with a hypothetical new protein unless we make it and study it. If we could predict the folding of new proteins on paper it would greatly speed up biomedical research. I think it is quite possible that a recent link between a particular protein and the development of dementia in Alzheimer’s disease is due to the way it folds.
Also, the less-than-perfect sound quality, as others have pointed out. And then the fact that everything comes from the same place, from the speakers, so that you can't tell where it's coming from as you do in person.
They don’t. It’s a kind of urban myth that the form of alcohol influences the kind of drunk. The differences are more from person to person or from situation to situation. One behaves differently, for example, if one drinks beer at a sporting event, or if one sips whisky at a hotel bar, or if one drinks shots at a dance hall, or whatever. This difference is almost entirely situational, not because alcohol causes different states of mind.
By blinking your eyelids, you push the crusty layer of tearing, tar, dirt, and dead skin. When you sleep, you don't blink and these substances accumulate in the corners of your eyes and form a crust.
Age, dehydration and cramps on the calves is a common symptom of the horse and poor circulation to the calf and stifle area, https://youtu.be/aieh2yn4auw.
When we choke it is because we have taken something else into our lungs than air. This something may be a bit of food or some liquid we have swallowed, including our own saliva. When we cough we throw out the air and that which is not air out of the lungs.
It tastes sweet because it is sweet. According to a quick Google search, a habanero pepper contains about 2-3 g of sugar per 100 g of flesh.
That's because flies are a larva of a fly. Adult flies come and lay their eggs in the decaying flesh, and the larvae hatch out and fly away somewhere else and eat something else. Of course, flies don't live very long, so some of them can't wait until they're fully grown.
You're probably also crashing from all the sugar. Unless you drink sugary coffee, then my guess is.
Calories are a measure of the molecules of food that our cells use for energy, mostly of the macromolecules—carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Some things that we call food contain none of these molecules, or so few that manufacturers are permitted by law to round them off to zero, and instead consist entirely of other molecules that our cells cannot use for energy, such as fiber and vitamins.
The remains of what the body does to the drug can be found in the urine. To put it in very practical terms, if you examine your poop really closely, you can sometimes see remnants of what you’ve eaten. One famous example is corn. This is the waste of what the body has done to the food. With just your eyes you can sometimes see what you’ve eaten. But drug tests are more sophisticated and look for certain chemicals that remain when the body processes a drug.
I don't quite know what you mean by scratching, but our brains usually react as if it were unpleasant to hear anything between 2,000 and 5,000 Hz. The amygdala begins to work as soon as it detects sounds in that range, which is the most sensitive to our ears. We don't know exactly why this is so, but we can assume that it's something biological and archaic. The best explanation I've seen is that this is the range of human screams, which for various reasons we find unpleasant to hear.
But why do we drown when we are submerged in water for too long? Our ancestors lived in the oceans. You are not your ancestors. You are different. You have adapted to a different environment.
, imagine a pot full of water. You can hear a bit when you shake it. But the same pot when half full will scream out. This is not the perfect analogy. But the rumbling of the stomach is like this. There is nothing inside the stomach to stop the sound of the rumbling.
Not all people absorb and burn food equally efficiently. And there are differences in hunger-inducing hormones.
They have more than five senses. But these five are the most important. There are also thermoception, proprioception, and nociception, but they sort of fall into the other categories.
mRNA stands for “messenger” RNA. So your DNA never actually leaves the cell nucleus. It is located in the nucleus of the cell. So the mRNA comes in, copies the sequence of DNA and then moves out into the cell. The mechanisms of the cell then convert this “message” into a protein. So the new therapies based on mRNA to treat genetic diseases attempt to block the copying of this “message,” which means that the cell cannot produce the wrong protein. The new vaccines based on mRNA (Pfizer/Moderna) contain the mRNA sequence that Covid requires to make its own protein. But traditional vaccines contained dead viruses or fragments of dead viruses so that the body can learn to recognize these viruses as harmful and develop the proper immunity to destroy them. The mRNA vaccines only contain the sequence of the gene. The body’s own protein-making mechanisms produce the protein, which then the body recognizes as harmful and destroys it.
There are several bones in the nose that give it its form. You can feel them when you feel them on the inside and outside of the nose. They can also move a little against each other, because they are not completely attached to each other, so you have a little movement in your nose. However, if you push your nose too far or in the wrong direction, you can break one or more of the bones in your nose. Then it will heal again and the broken bones will fuse over time. That happens fairly quickly, the bones will begin to fuse together again in a few minutes. The trouble is that the bones will only come together as they are and will not return to their previous position on their own. So it is not unusual for people who have had their noses broken but who have not been treated for it to end up with a wrong-shaped nose because the bones fused in the wrong place. In addition, the nose is partly blocked in this way and it may also increase the risk of breaking the nose again in the future. It is possible to correct a nose that has healed incorrectly, but then it is necessary to break it again, so that the bones can be set in place and fixed until they heal. It is not only the case with a broken nose, as all bones have the ability to fuse together crookedly after they have been broken.
Because when you cook it yourself, you’re already familiar with the smell, and that can dull the sense of taste.
nausea is a natural reaction to gastrointestinal upset, such as food poisoning (among many others). The first reaction of the stomach is to throw up the contents, for which nausea often precedes. During this time, the stomach does not want to accept any food, which is why it is repulsed by the smell, taste, sight, or thought of food.
As a matter of fact, not to go into the boring science too much (since I can’t remember it from my high school days more than two decades ago), the cell division which produces the reproductive cells (sperm and egg) in human beings is not the same as that which produces non-reproductive cells. When the non-reproductive cells divide, they produce the entire chromosomal pair (your chromosomes come in pairs, one from the father and one from the mother) and so the new cells end up with a complete set of chromosomes. When the reproductive cells divide, however, they divide the chromosomal pair in half. The result is that the male gets an XY pair of chromosomes and the female gets an XXY pair. When the male produces the male reproductive cells (the sperm), one sperm gets the X chromosome and the other gets the Y chromosome.
My DNA is a mixture of both my parents'. It does not match with my father's, but with half of my father's. My brother's DNA matches with half of my father's. But not the same half. Each sperm contains a random sample of half of its parent's DNA. On average, you and your brother should match each other in about a quarter of your DNA. But it can vary from 0 to 100 percent.
A means of repairing the pancreas in a diabetic person. If the diabetes is Type II and still in the early stages, you can slow down or reverse the condition with better diet and exercise.
When your brain has used up its supply of ‘I’m tired’ juice, the stupid thing goes on making more. That’s fine if you keep the cycle going by waking up when the supply is exhausted, before it has made any more, but if you do wake up with sleep juice still in the head, you’re stuffed.
The whooshing sound is caused by the blood rushing to your head.
It’s not just carbs that cause obesity. A typical American consumes an enormous amount of snacks, fats, sugars, and starches. In France it’s only 16 liters per year, so 1/10 as much. American portions are also on average much larger. On average, plates in the US are bigger than in Europe because Americans eat more. You can also take the American favorite, MacDonald’s, as an example. In the US, their “medium” size is like our “large” size.
It's not easy to make, and the methods of production have been patented, but recently some other ways to biosynthesize the substance have been found, and those wishing to experiment with it are free to do so.
Fat is an extremely efficient form of energy storage. It is so difficult to lose because it stores sooo much energy. To burn off one pound of fat, you have to stop eating for a day or two. A common number is that a pound of fat contains 3500 to 4500 calories, but it gets complicated. If you prefer to do it the old-fashioned way, you would have to walk a mile to burn off 100 calories (and running doesn’t burn much more, but it does take less time). To put it in perspective, that’s half a Snickers bar. To add to this, exercise is beneficial for reasons other than short-term calorie burning. It does good things for your health. Edit: Since people are bringing it up again, running burns maybe 50% more than walking, depending on the speed at which you count it as running or walking. This is per mile. If you run twice as fast as you walk, you are at least doubling the amount of energy you use per hour.
Lots of research is being done on this right now. The prevailing theory is that the venom is carried into the bloodstream through the lymphatic system. There may be a few snakes for whom this is not true.
It has to do with some of the primitive functions of the brain. Sadness and happiness help us survive. For our ancestors, sadness was a motive for bettering their situation and finding happiness. Happiness means security. When you’re happy, your brain releases certain chemicals, which are very desirable to the brain. The more, the better. For example, if you’re hungry, your brain produces fewer of those chemicals that make you happy. So you’re a little sadder because you’re hungry. Or, at least, you have less sadness. When you eat, your brain sees that as something happy and so it releases the happy chemicals. Eventually, your brain learns that eating is something that makes you happy. So you eat when you’re hungry. And you also learn the things that make your brain produce those happy chemicals. For some people, riding a roller coaster makes them happy. Even though it looks very dangerous. So down go the things that seem interesting. Depending on how your brain defines happy and sad, some things will seem more interesting to you because they meet a whole lot of criteria that the brain associates with happy triggers. Then you’ll be interested in them because they’re more likely to make your brain produce the happy chemicals. In a very naive explanation, that is.
Both. The rivers were cleaner then, and their stomachs were accustomed to it. Although it’s generally advisable not to drink directly from a large river or a brown brackish lake, drinking from a clear spring is usually safe—at least where I live.
But they almost always have relative colour vision, and many people with mild colour blindness do not know they are colour blind until they are adults and take a test. All it does is make it harder to distinguish certain colours because they are more or less similar to each other.
It’s a mixed bag. On one hand, there are fewer deaths and hospitalizations and that’s good. But on the other hand, if it becomes the dominant strain, and spreads more effectively and evades the immune system, it could, and has a good chance of, leading to more deaths and hospitalizations. In mathematical terms, if a person in a population of one hundred thousand is infected by the Delta strain, and of those one hundred are hospitalized, that means twenty percent of all positive cases end up in the hospital. But if the Omicron strain infects one thousand people out of a hundred thousand, and only ten percent of them are hospitalized, that means there would be one hundred hospitalized, or five times as many hospitalizations as with the Delta strain even though the serious cases are a half as often as with O.E. Besides that, the more hospitals fill up with O.E. patients, the less room they have for other patients. So, here is one approach, using hypothetical numbers again, to the problem of why O.E. still poses a serious threat despite its lower rate of serious infections. Hope this helps, take care.
Bromelain breaks down the p5rones in the skin of the lips, tongue, and cheeks, and this gives the feeling of a raw or numb mouth.
When I cry I get bruises on the top of my eyelids. There is too much pressure from my cheeks and my eyes are swollen. When I smile, however, the pressure is pushed out and the skin is wrinkled and creased. That difference between pure pressure on the eyelids and on the outside of the eyes is probably why the tears do not cause bruising, so I assume that that is also why it does not cause puffiness. That's probably not the whole story, but it's something.
A vein is a blood vessel that carries blood towards the heart, while an artery carries blood away from the heart. A vein has a lower pressure than an artery. If you only want to talk about tubes that carry blood, you should say blood vessel. To answer your question, the blood from the heart is divided into smaller and smaller veins until it reaches the capillaries and is able to squirt through the tissue. Every living cell needs to be able to get in direct contact with a blood cell, so blood must be able to travel everywhere in the body. So in a way yes, you are a sack full of blood, although it is much more complicated than that.
First, it would have to be pushed in hard to get it into a blood vessel. Blood is under pressure, like a big tube of water that’s being squeezed, which is why blood will come out of a cut even when you’re holding it up above your head instead of dripping out as gravity would prefer. Secondly, if that were to happen, the object would act as a clot. It would go around until it found a blood vessel that was too narrow for it to pass, and it would plug up that place. If you’re lucky, it’s a small blood vessel in your finger or something, and you’ll just have some skin die off, and the debris will be pulled out with the dead skin. If it’s a big, rough pebble, it could hurt the blood vessels and prevent blood from reaching a very important organ, such as your left kidney or a large part of your brain.
Everything affects the brain. Even reading this question is already causing chemical changes in your brain. We have 100 billion brain cells, and there may be 100-200 quadrillion nerve connections in the brain, so every experience affects our brain. To be honest, this is still a relatively little understood subject despite the progress we have made.
When the animals went from being one-celled to being multi-celled, they lost the B12-making enzymes. We don't know exactly why, but we do know that B12 is a very complicated molecule to make, requiring a lot of steps and a lot of energy. But you don't need much of it, so it might have been advantageous for the early creatures to get B12 from eating bacteria rather than making it themselves. We still have a few of the B12-making enzymes, because they are also used in making other molecules like hemoglobin and chlorophyll, which are structurally similar. But the last and most complicated enzymes don't exist in our DNA.
To use a metaphor, think about the Vietnam War. The side that has more men and material doesn't necessarily win. The most critical part of the immune system is the organization. Recognizing what is a disease and what isn't (false alarms are essentially allergic reactions, and they are potentially deadly), as well as a timely and effective response to the disease itself. The general-purpose arms of your immune system are good to gain time, but the fight is won by the specialized troops that were developed to combat exactly this threat. If a simple increase in the number of defenders alone would increase the chances of survival, the body would produce them. Disease has always been one of the main forces of selection.
Breakdown of trust between the government, the pharmaceutical industry, and the public. Generally, the middle ground gets lost, because as with most topics nowadays, it’s polarized between the two extremes.
Generally, what is comfortable depends on what you are used to. If you are used to bad posture, you get used to feeling it normal and comfortable. Basically, your muscles and tendons adjust to your bad posture by getting weaker, stronger, shorter or longer. This happens automatically and according to the force you put on them. I used to have really bad posture, and I thought it was comfortable, until I had a problem with it. I then changed my posture, and it is just as comfortable now that I am used to it. In fact, it is just as comfortable now that I don’t have to think about it. This is because what you are used to is what you are used to. But I have physically demanding work, and it is impossible to do it with bad posture. So you unconsciously correct your posture to do your job. Things like supporting the abdomen and the like are much more efficient when you use your body correctly. You also get much more power and endurance. Things like walking long distances are easier. (You should do this, it does wonders for your posture and back.)
They can and do. Anyone who says the opposite is lying or hasn't given it a thought.
Because they don't go to medical school, they don't have the same scientific and medical education, and they don't study the different systems of the body in the same depth as a doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy. Some of them have a bachelor's degree or a doctor of physical therapy, so they're actually doctors.
Some ants will die without their colony, because other anthills will reject them or consider them enemies. There are ant species that will work together with other anthills of the same species and form supercolonies, and they will merge into another colony if they find one of their own species.
The developing embryo knows how large it should grow (within a certain margin of error), no matter what the initial conditions. The initial division takes place in less than a day. Because cellular division is so fast, it takes very little time to catch up, and so the twin embryos are about the same size as a single embryo.
A little biochemistry. Sodium, which is part of salt, is a molecule that attracts water. So if you fill your blood with a lot of salt water, the water that's in your cells will come out and enter your blood to balance the sodium in your blood, so you'll end up dehydrated. And if that goes on for too long, it can be fatal.
It's still an open question. The general assumption is that at some point simple chemistry and self-replicating molecules became life. The first life was based on RNA and not DNA as we are. There is some disagreement as to where this happened. Tidepools were for a long time the favourites, but now deep-sea vents are in the running too. And then there is the whole panspermia theory (don't laugh, that's the name of it). It's the theory that life didn't begin on earth at all, but was seeded here by asteroids containing primitive life from elsewhere. It doesn't solve the problem of how life began, it only moves it to another place. But it has a huge significance for the search for life on other planets.
The plant turns yellow when it is weak or damaged, so it looks to them like dinnertime. Unlike plants and insects, however, they have not evolved to tell the difference between a yellow hat and a yellow plant.
For the sake of simplicity, let's assume you can eat the bag in one go. In that instant you gain 500g, but as soon as you start to eat you start to lose weight again, because breathing includes water and gases, and every breath makes you lighter. You start digesting the chips, which costs energy. And the heart beats, the body heats up, etc., etc., and so some of the energy will be used for these functions. Unused absorbed energy will be stored as fat. Some of the undigested components will come out again with some of the intestinal bacteria, and you will lose weight again.
That’s simple: evolution. Those individuals who ‘feel no need’ don’t reproduce, and so they don’t pass on their ‘no need’ genes. Those who ‘feel the need’ do reproduce, and so most organisms will feel the need, because they are the descendants of those who ‘felt the need’ and thus inherited those genes. Most people have this misconception about evolution, that it’s about individuals, when in fact it’s more about genes. If a certain mutation makes life difficult but increases the chances of reproducing successfully, you’ll end up with a bunch of sad creatures.
There are many factors determining stamina, but the most important is the ability of the heart and lungs, or of the entire circulatory system, to supply oxygen to the body. Endurance exercises, like running, make the circulation system work better, strengthen the heart and increase the blood volume.
I think koalas would have something to say about that. There's a huge chlamydia epidemic in them.
You can still be a diabetic if you are not fat, being fat just means your health has gotten so bad that it is more likely to happen. But like everything else, too much is bad for you. No matter if you are fat or not.
hunger is caused by the sphincter muscles of the stomach lining contracting when the stomach is empty or almost empty. There are several different hormones that can cause this to happen. Satiety is a feeling of fullness. When food is introduced into an empty stomach the sphincter muscles have something to contract around (instead of only acid and air bubbles), and so after a few minutes the sensation of hunger goes away and you feel sated or "full."
There is always a fifty percent chance that the baby will be a girl or a boy. Whether your relatives have sons or daughters has nothing to do with your children’s sex.
The difference lies in the definition. There are two definitions, the botanical and the culinary. The botanical definition is a little strict: fruit is a fleshy, seed-bearing organ of a plant. The culinary definition is a little vague: fruit is usually a juicy part of a plant, which is drank or eaten as a dessert, and the vegetable is eaten as a side dish.
The child does not speak a language when he/she is born, but will acquire the language of the parent or parents. If the father is speaking Spanish and spends more time with the child than the mother, the child may speak Spanish. If the child is given to adopt parents and is brought up in Japan, the child will speak Japanese.
They’re not letters and scientific words, but things in breast milk. It’s such an amazing substance, containing all the macro- and micro-nutrients a baby needs, and in the exact proportions for proper development. Over time, evolution has refined it into the perfect food for babies. Everybody recommends it as the sole food for the first six months. Not every mother can, so formula milk is an attempt to produce a synthetic substance that resembles breast milk. But it’s made by a different process, and those chemicals are the formula used to try to get the same molecules in the right proportions. They’re on the label because there’s a law, not because most mothers have the chemistry background to understand them.
Some of the drugs act on a gene involved in the replication of the DNA. The advantage of this is that the cell is only affected if it is trying to duplicate itself, and cells that do not do this are not affected at all. For example, nerve cells do not duplicate themselves, so they are not affected by these drugs. But the most aggressive cancers literally never stop duplicating their DNA. As a result, if you break this process, more of the cancer cells die than of any others, and so the cancer dies faster than you. This is also why chemo is bad for the sperm and white blood cells. They both replicate very fast, so they are harmed most of all.
They do, and it hurts like hell. This happens when one of the testicles turns around, tangling the blood-vessel of the testicle, resulting in sudden and usually excruciating pain and scrotal swelling. This can happen to anyone, at any age, even at birth. The testicle is usually saved with quick surgery, but if the blockage has lasted for too long, it can no longer be saved and has to be cut out.
Hypoallergenic doesn't mean that there can't be an allergy, it means that the risks are minimized. This means that they use less allergens than they would otherwise have done to make an equivalent product.
But the two are not the same to a Bengal tiger. If you had grown up with Bengal tigers, you would have been able to distinguish between them as well. You, the human being, have learned to differentiate between one human being and another from the day you were born. Bengal tigers are able to do the same, because they live in a family of their own.
The eyes have three different cones, with different kinds of pigments. The pigments absorb the light, and that pigment is attached to a molecule called retinal, a molecule that’s stuck inside the cones. This molecule has a bend in the middle, but when a photon hits it, it straightens up and this movement of the retinal molecule pushes the other proteins around it, and that movement of the other proteins gives them a signal to act. The molecules around the retinal molecule change the molecule’s chemical environment just enough to absorb slightly different wavelengths of light. If each cone cell makes only one kind of pigment, it can distinguish between colours. But there’s actually a lot of overlap in how the different pigments absorb different wavelengths. Q: Why can we see a colour like yellow whether it’s made by a single wavelength or by a combination of two? A: “Yellow” is made when the cone cells that make green and the cone cells that make red are both stimulated. That can be because the light is exactly between their two best wavelengths (“true yellow”), or because it’s a mixture of the two best wavelengths (“green and red”). The visual system has no way of distinguishing between these two possibilities; it just counts the amount of signal that each kind of cone sends. Here’s a picture of how the cone cells (and the rods) respond to different colours. The red and green cones are so close together that it’s almost not right to call them red and green.
Both beef and turkey can contain many potentially harmful bacteria and parasites. But the interesting thing about beef is that those parasites are found only on the surface, the part that's in contact with the air. Because beef is a very dense meat, it's difficult for pathogens to spread through the interior. So you only need to thoroughly cook the outside of a steak to kill the risk of contamination. Also, that's why a rare steak is okay but a hamburger patty must be cooked to a higher temperature. Once the surface contamination has been mixed into the ground meat, the contamination has spread all the way through. Chicken and turkey are softer meats, so the contamination usually reaches deeper than the surface. So to kill the contamination, the chicken or turkey must be cooked all the way through. Think of it this way: If there's mold on a hard cheese, like Parmesan, you can scrape off the mold and eat the rest. But if there's mold on a soft cheese, like Brie or ricotta, the whole thing has to be thrown out if it molds (we're not talking about molds used to make cheese spicier).
The body doesn’t kill bacteria with fever. The body kills bacteria with leukocytes (white blood cells) and with antibodies (large molecules that can attach to the outer membrane of bacteria and bind to it and stop it or get it down). The fever slows down the reproduction of the bacteria so that the first reaction has a better chance of being sufficient. Other special responses of the body during infection also increase its effectiveness. It can, for example, store iron inside cells and thus not let it be “sucked” by bacteria, which need it for their reproduction. Copper levels can also change during infections, etc. (more about that here: www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29353-2) The body just tries to deprive itself of these “luxuries” that are not necessary for the body itself but necessary for other microorganisms. A good example of us learning to approach infections with this technique of “do more harm to them than to us” was the use of arsenic before the invention of the antibiotics. Yes, it kills us... but it kills bacteria faster. (More about that here: www.nature.com/articles/s41599-0... )
The immune system is quite diversified. There are many different components to the immune system than just the fever. The fever is not the first and least, let alone the best. It only makes you feel miserable. It is okay to relieve the symptoms of a sickness to make yourself feel more comfortable (fever, headache, etc.), because this does not have a very great effect on the immune system. If you were so sick that a fever would have a strong effect on your immune system, then you would be in the hospital.
test and error. That's why toddlers are so confused in three-dimensional space while they're moving. They have to learn by trial and error. That's one of the most important senses. Stretches and contracts. Pressed against, pulled by. (mimicking acceleration).
Basically, it doesn't. You can easily and painfully burn off the prints completely. I think you're talking about finger-print identification. This method takes only a few features of fingerprints that are very common and compares very small differences. If you cut your finger, those differences will still be there, but your whole print will change. Finger-print identification is not a precise science, and your body doesn't want to reproduce it when you hurt yourself. The blisters are below the skin, they only lift up the uppermost layers.
I do not understand what you mean by this, and I do not know if you are speaking the truth, or if you have some brain disorder and see your brain activity.
Not exactly known. Scientists believe there is a genetic link between being right- or left-handed, but no one has ever proved this. Two hypotheses explain the theory of the smart hand. The first is that all movement must be learned by the brain. Babies learn to sit up, crawl, walk, run, and at the same time they also learn how to pick things up, how to grasp things, how to throw things. And scientists think it is easier for the brain to just do this and develop neural pathways in one hand. You need both feet to walk, but it does not matter which hand you pick something up with. The second part of the question is: if the brain chooses a smart hand, why are most people right-handed? Here the assumption is that when human beings and their ancestors learned to make and use tools, it was useful for evolution that everyone used the tools with one hand. Because it is easier to make one tool that everyone can use than to make several. But it is more a theory than a proven fact.
Most of your pain-receptors are located just under your skin (subcutis). They are more easily irritated. That’s why burned skin (e.g., from sliding across the gymnasium floor as a schoolboy) hurts a great deal more than, say, a bruise from a fall or a wound from a collision.
Same as if it was happening in front of you. It’s the same as with prostitution.
No. If you eat fewer calories than you burn, you lose weight. If you eat more than you burn, you gain weight. This is an oversimplification, but unless you are already very lean and are trying to get just a little more ripped for a photo shoot, overthinking it is a waste of energy. In fact, I ate a huge meal just before bed the night before a figure competition, and I was actually too lean for the division, so I didn't place in the contest because I was too lean. It doesn't matter when you eat, it matters how much you eat.
The Nix v. Hedden case came to be a go-to reason. There was a difference between taxes on fruits and vegetables. Those claiming that tomatoes are fruits, not vegetables, to pay lower taxes, argued in court. But the court declared that the tax law used common terms for fruits and vegetables, not botanical ones. Rightfully so in my opinion, because, as you say, there is no botanical definition for vegetables.
The maggots hatch out from small eggs. The flies lay their eggs on the decaying flesh, but the eggs are small and blend in very well, so that when they hatch, they seem to come from nowhere; but it is only because the eggs had not been seen.
The general rule is that the highways (autostrassen) are walled or fenced on both sides to keep animals from wandering into the path of moving vehicles. So, in a way, the animals are “herded,” so to speak, by the barriers towards the animal crossing bridges. Besides, believe it or not, animals have a memory and they learn where to cross rivers, roads, etc.
Imagine a cake. You need a number of ingredients to make it, but in the end you have a cake. Some of the ingredients are more important than others (the eggs, the flour) while others are less important (the almond extract, the pinch of salt). Now let's add a few drops of lemon juice to the cake. Is it going to change the cake much? It's still going to look like a cake, but with a slight tang of lemon. Is it still the same cake? No. The results of genetic modification are difficult to predict, which is why they're only dealt with by people more knowledgeable than I am. But if you make small changes to a non-vital gene, you might not change the end product much.
But one does not simply pass out, so one must try to get at the cause of the fainting. Is it a low blood pressure? Asphyxiation? Or a head injury? If the problem is not quickly solved, the person will probably not recover and may die.
If viable portions of their genetic code were available, we could certainly clone them back to life. But I do not believe that there is any such sample of these creatures’ DNA. Then, of course, we would need to find a host creature to gestate the clone. This is easier said than done. Once it came to life, it would only be a female or a male of its species, and we would still have no way of cloning its mate. So no. Neither the thylacine nor any other such creature can ever be brought back to life. Now, with creatures threatened with extinction in the present day, we can save enough genetic material and even freeze the sperm and eggs of the last of their kind, but the technology to clone and then mate these clones to restore a species is still far off. Captive breeding and artificial insemination are already under way, but many of these creatures simply do not reproduce in captivity.
You're probably referring to snow blindness. It's very difficult to study and it doesn't really come under medical care since it doesn't affect your health, so we don't understand very well why it happens. But we think that it comes from the brain and not from the eye, and that it may come from the brain's visual processing center becoming overexcited. There are brain cells that are usually excited when the eye's light-sensitive cells detect light, but in some people they start to fire randomly without being excited. It's probably because other parts of the brain that communicate with this area of the brain interpret these random signals as images.
It takes energy to maintain muscles. The body constantly tries to save energy, and so the unused muscles simply consume energy without any purpose. So the body naturally depletes them, because it can't support them and obviously doesn't need them. That is why fat stays, because it's a reserve of energy for hard times. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find shortages in food in the West.
The following incident actually happened in the NBA. Without exaggeration, Allen Iverson was convinced that the ring was too low by two inches. The referees stopped the game, took out a tape measure, and Iverson was right.
The arteries become hardened with age and a bad diet and lifestyle and the heart has to pump harder. Obesity makes the arteries thicker and longer and the blood has to be pumped harder. The systolic pressure is what the heart has to overcome to pump the blood into the tissues.
that’s always the problem when you’re making a drug to cure or stop an illness. It’s not hard to kill the virus; it’s not easy to stop killing what’s around the virus. That’s why chloroquine was labelled as a cockroach killer. The dose needed to kill the virus was the same as the dose needed to kill a man. But the conspiracy theorists never questioned it. They just believed that someone was evil and wanted to keep them from using a miraculous cure.
“Energy can neither be created nor destroyed.” If a life is created, for example, a human baby, where does the energy of the baby come from? The material from which your body (or that of someone else) is built up comes from the food you eat and the air you breathe. All the energy you need to put these materials (mostly carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen) together properly, comes from some of the chemical bonds in these materials. The initial source of this energy is the sun. Plants and algae use photosynthesis, which converts sunlight to chemical energy.
Its legs have hard hairs (essentially, it’s a chitinous shell) that scratch against the cricket’s body, which is also hard (a hard chitinous shell). The friction of all the hairs against the hard chitinous shell makes the sound.
If the body didn't respond with fever to kill it, or with pain from blood rushing to it, the germ would be completely unchecked, eat your cells, multiply and then you would no longer be a human being, you would be a bunch of germ factories. You would be dead.
You have been standing on your feet almost your whole life. They were made to stand on. Now look at a thigh: it has a lot more muscle than a hand.
The Omicran variant is very new and we are still learning about it. It seems to be a great deal more contagious than the Delta. Therefore it is more easily passed from person to person. It also seems to be less responsive to vaccination. But recent research suggests that Omicran is on average less deadly than the Delta. But because of the higher infection rate, the overall toll is higher. Unfortunately.
It stimulates the tear ducts, which moisten the eyes because they’re a little dry when you wake up. I think it also stimulates some nerves around the eye, which relaxes you a little.
Sometimes other ingredients are added for the aromas, sometimes the beer/wine actually uses those ingredients. I am a home brewer. I have a chocolate mint stout in my fermenter right now. It has minty hops that I added and also added more mint for the sake of even more mint. Usually the ingredients are either the grains or the hops. Coffee, bread and nutty flavors can be from the grain used, fruity or herbal flavors come from the hops. Some hops impart a bitter flavor, others a fruity or herbal flavor. The yeast in a beer like a hefeweizen gives it a banana and clove flavor. Basically, all beer is water, grain, hops and yeast. Depending on what kind of grain, hops and yeast are used, the flavor of the beer can vary. Fruits, coffee, herbs, spices and other spices can be added during the brewing process to help improve the flavors.
It does, I think, but the cold temperature in the refrigerator prevents it from growing out of hand. That’s why you shouldn’t store yoghurt in the larder. It’s also why there’s a best-before-date on the label.
Rule No. 7 orders you to search the sub before boarding it.
I'm a ftm, but I'm familiar with some of the things about the transition from a man to a woman. First of all, you don't need to take any drugs or have surgery to be a trans. There are many trans people who don't take drugs and don't have surgery because they're used to it. Depending on where you live, you may need to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. You can get this diagnosis from a gender therapist who examines you. Then, you can see an endocrinal doctor who can give you the drug if you are going to a woman, but before you do, you must first draw blood and check your hormone level. There are several ways to take the drug. You can take it in the form of pills or injections. You will then go through female puberty (growth of breasts, fat changes, mood swings, increased / decreased libido, etc.). There are some things that you can't change with drugs, such as a deep voice or body hair. For voice, many transwomen see orthophonists and learn to speak in a high voice, or have their vocal cords resected. As for body hair and facial hair, most transwomen remove them with a hair removal device. Some transwomen have breast augmentation surgery if their natural breasts are too small. It also requires replacement surgery every two to three years. Lastly, there is a vaginoplasty. Some transwomen see this as the end of their transition. There are several ways for transwomen to get vaginas, but I don't know exactly how they do it. I hope this is useful.
- Because our body uses calories for energy. When we take in more energy than we use, our body will store the surplus as fat. It isn't more complicated than that. If you constantly fill the petrol tank of your car but hardly use it, then the tank will be filled and will eventually overflow.
The difference is slight, but anticoagulants inhibit the clotting process itself, not necessarily the platelets, whereas anti-platelets specifically target the platelets.
Scrubs aren’t sterile. They’re just out of the dryer and you put them on. They’re meant to be washed off any dirt that might get on them without staining them.
2. The field of wheelchair athletes is much smaller, so a truly great athlete can be exceptional over many distances. 3. The difference between ‘maximum’ and ‘maximum sustained’ may be much less in a wheelchair than in a running race. In that case, the same athlete would be expected to win over many distances, as they would be similar.
It’s not actually blood. It’s built up tissue that coats the uterus, and then, when a period starts, the body forces that tissue to slough off and be pushed out of the body. Our skin sheds similarly, but it’s a lot easier for our bodies.
That’s the question. It doesn’t go anywhere. It stays inside the body until it’s slowly cleared away. That’s why it hurts so much and for so long.
Yes and no. One has to treat the symptoms. The patient has to rest. Rest is also part of the treatment. One must feel better, so the body is in the best position to fight the disease. This means you have to treat the symptoms. And what one means by direct healing is a rather nebulous concept. In general, the body is largely healed by its own healing powers. Even a medicine like an anti-biotic, which kills bacteria, is a kind of strengthening for the body. Does that count as healing? Reducing a fever, which could perhaps be dangerous and affect the brain? Reducing nausea, so the patient can eat and drink something as he fights his illness? Is that healing?
Hemoglobin, the part of the blood which carries the oxygen, absorbs infrared radiation. When it carries oxygen molecules, it still absorbs infrared radiation, but it does so in a slightly different way. (Hemoglobin without oxygen absorbs more strongly at shorter wavelengths.) So when you measure the level of oxygen in the blood, you send infrared radiation into the finger and you measure the amount of radiation at a certain wavelength that comes through. From the amount of radiation absorbed, you (or the little calculator in the oxymeter) calculate the ratio of oxygenated to unoxygenated hemoglobin—in other words, the oxygenation of the blood.
When liver gets too damaged by long-term alcohol abuse, it can cause cirrhosis, a disease that causes the formation of a scar tissue in the liver. The scar tissue destroys the ability of the liver to regenerate itself.
Alcohol is a general term for a class of chemical compounds that yeast produces when it breaks down sugars from fruits and grains in a process called fermentation. There are many different alcohols (such as ethanol, methanol, and propanol), but they all have in common a hydroxyl group, a chemical structure that is extremely good at binding to other molecules. This binds so well that the molecules that it binds to get dissolved. That is how alcohol kills microorganisms, by dissolving their protective cell membranes and then reacting with the contents inside.
But it's usually strongmen, not bodybuilders. Bodybuilders aren't strong enough. The reason is the pressure inside. One must hold his breath when lifting such heavy objects in order to have more strength, but since the pressure inside is so high, certain blood vessels may burst, thus causing what you saw.
Because it is actually unpleasant, lol. Muscle building consists of deliberately damaging the muscles and stretching them so that they develop stronger by repairing the microtears. If you’re not in good shape, you’ll have a harder time breathing because your lungs are weaker and tire more easily.
It's because when animals eat raw meat, it has usually just been killed and so hasn't had time to accumulate bad bacteria. When you humans eat raw meat, you buy it from a butcher's, and it's handled and it's packed, and it's been god knows how long since it's been in a package before you eat it.
Yes, that's what's called depression. I don't want to diagnose over the Internet, but I would definitely go to a psychiatrist.
Some hibernating animals have the ability to extract and reuse their own body's whey, which makes their muscles recover much more slowly. Some animals even wake up in hibernation and go foraging to fill their nutrient reserves, and then go back to sleep.
The answers you’ve been getting so far are either inaccurate or too narrow. If you do it a lot, it’s probably a sign of Restless Legs. That’s a mild disorder that causes a certain discomfort if you don’t move your legs enough, and it’s soothing to move them. The cause is still unknown, but as far as I know, it’s partly hereditary and made worse by caffeine, for instance. If you do it only occasionally, it could be a form of self-soothing. Some people do it when they’re under strain or agitated. There are other causes of the leg jig, but these are the most common as far as I know.
It is because smoking cannabis makes the effects felt almost immediately, which is desirable in many cases where medical cannabis is prescribed. Take for example the management of pain and anxiety: the faster you can relieve the symptoms, the better. Smoking is the fastest way to feel the effects. It does, of course, also carry with it many of the health risks of tobacco smoke. But most patients would probably say that the relatively fast onset of action outweighs the harmful effects on the lungs and airways.
No. Women have approximately a million ova at birth, but only 300,000 remain by puberty. In a lifetime, about 350 of them are fertilized. The exact number is different for everyone. Menopause is usually a result of changing hormones, not egg quantity. It is therefore possible to have a lot of periods in one's lifetime and to have a late menopause. Here's a fun fact: The ova in the ovaries are in the follicles. The ovum grows from an ovum to an oocyst and finally into an ovum. So once every 28 days or so, your brain says, “Hey, it's time to get pregnant,” and it releases GnRH, which in turn stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH, which stimulates the follicles to mature, which then become ovulated and release the ova (or so it goes; just remember about fraternal twins). So in a month you can lose about 1,000 ovulated ova. But as you get older, the ova are the ovulated ova, but they are old and lower in quality. They can have abnormal chromosomes, which are the causes of various birth defects, such as Down's disease, etc.
The opposite of "severe" is "benign", and the opposite of "acute" is "chronic". The words are not opposite.
Firstly, Neanderthals are not the direct ancestors of modern man. Secondly, the barrier between species is not always clearly defined; this question applies to everything. For animals with sexual reproduction, the definition of species is: “Two animals are of the same species if they can have fertile offspring.” If a Homo erectus and a modern man inter-bred, they could not produce fertile offspring, so they would be different species. The transition is progressive; there was no Homo erectus one day, and Homo sapiens the next, but through a process of gradual change new species arise.
The fur of an animal works by keeping air close to the body, so that the body can heat it and so there is a good layer of thermal insulating material. Fur is also very good at managing water, because water is 25 times more efficient than air in transmitting heat. So if you get wet fur against your skin, you can release 25 times more of your body heat to the environment, as it evaporates. Fur is close-packed against the skin, and thins out and spreads more widely as it moves further from the body. Also, against the skin, water-repellent oil is secreted, and fur furthest away isn't. This means that water sits in the fur, on the outer or middle layers, and then evaporates from there, rather than directly from the skin. The otter has 25,000-165,000 hairs per square centimetres, that is, 163,000–1,072,000 hairs per square inch. Therefore, wet fur does not make the animal so cold. Having enough water in the middle fur layer actually helps to trap the air next to the skin. A clothing manufacturer, the outdoor brand Paramo, has actually made a garment that has been based on this principle. They call it a 'directive water pump'. It's not water-repellent, like Gore-Tex, but it keeps you warm by transporting water away from the skin, and allowing it to evaporate from the outer layer.
Imagine blood types as countries, red blood cells as their inhabitants, and the plasma as their soldiers. Type A blood has horns like a devil, type B blood has pitchforks, type AB blood has both horns and pitchforks, and type O blood is just like regular people. If a person with devil horns or pitchforks enters type O territory, their blood will be killed by the soldiers because they are foreign and might be a virus, but if a person with type O blood enters any other territory, he or she will be passed over because they are just plain people, without distinguishing characteristics. This is why type O can donate blood to all, but its soldiers will kill all other blood. It is fine to enter type AB country, where the soldiers are accustomed to both horns and pitchforks, but the blood will be killed by other soldiers because it is foreign.
if you like the feeling of the gas, you probably like carbonated drinks.
I will start with tattoos. The particles injected under the skin by the tattoo gun are very large. Once a cell dies it is removed by the cells called macrophages. But the body cannot digest a certain particle larger than a certain size. Thus tattoos are left behind. The formation of scars is a little more complicated but I will try to explain it in simple words. Scars are of two kinds. One is clean wounds like that made by a scalpel and the other is inflicted by some mutilating machine. When the wound is clean, the edges are pulled together to heal it. But when the skin is inflicted by some mutilating machine the body responds immediately by forming a hard tissue (collagen). Collagen is also a naturally occurring protein. But the scar-forming collagen differs from the normal collagen. It can be called a specialized form of collagen. A: Let me also point out another important thing. The upper most layer of the skin which is replaced frequently is called the epidermis. But the underlying dermis is not replaced so frequently and at such a high rate. In some cases the damage to the skin goes beyond the epidermis and goes as deep as the dermis. Such scars may fade for about two years after which they start becoming permanent. It is the same with tattoos. The pigments used in tattoos are injected into the dermis. Now the tattoos can be removed. Now there are tattoo removal procedures. In this the pigment particles are broken down into smaller sizes and then the macrophages can digest it. It is also not true that all the cells of the body are replaced in a span of 7 years. The cells of the heart, brain and other vital organs are not replaced.
Ageing is, basically, a breakdown of the organism. As with the engine of a car: if you use it often or subject it to heavy strain, it will break sooner.
You’ve got it backwards. It limits our reproductive appeal because we know that’s where to look for excess fat and therefore unhealthy conditions. If people got fat ears instead of fat bellies, we’d judge health from the ears, and they’d be considered unattractive.
Water, H2O, is the basic building block of life on earth. Our bodies are mainly water, so our cells are also mainly water. We lose water through the lungs, through the kidneys, through the sweat glands, through the intestines, through the kidneys and through the liver. We have to compensate for that. We can hydrate ourselves with all kinds of drinks, but water is obviously the purest means of replenishing our bodies with H2O.
Inside the sex organ, there is a sponge tissue, corpus cavernosum, which fills up with blood, making it hard. The sponge tissue in some men does not expand as much. It is like two penises of equal size when erected. One gets softer and becomes less pliable, and the other remains harder. It is only a property of corpus cavernosum, which varies.
Calories are just units of energy. The amount of energy is determined based on what are called macronutrients: fat, carbohydrate, protein and alcohol. Each macronutrient has a specific number of calories per gram, which adds up to the total number of calories. The scientific method was used to find these values, which involved using a machine to actually burn the food and determine the amount of calories by measuring the length of time it took. Now it’s just a matter of checking the figures that are available. So, for example, if turkey has 100 calories, that’s based on how much fat, carbohydrate and protein it contains.
For quick access, we store glycogen in the muscles and liver, basically simple carbs. Its what you burn when you exercise, and when you exhaust it, you experience the dreaded wall or bonk. For the ultimate quick access, theres blood sugar. Low blood sugar sets off the release of the hormone glucagon, which turns glycogen into sugar.
Because it is very special cells that enable us to grow two meters. They are the stem cells which are capable of turning into any other kind of cells in the body and which do most of the crazy and remarkable growth that happens in the womb. And as a child you grow up by means of stem cells but also of the specialized parts of the body which are meant to grow. For example, the bones have what are called growth plates, and as the child grows the bones lengthen and grow through these growth plates (if you damage a growth plate it can badly affect the bone growth, and that’s bad). But when you’re a grown-up, your body is largely made up of specialized cells, so when you cut off a finger, there is nothing left at the knuckle which knows what a finger is or how to grow it back. It knows only that it is bleeding and that the bleeding must stop. The blood vessels close and form a scab, and the skin slowly grows back from the edges to the middle. But nothing in that region ‘knows’ that it has to regenerate the bone and cartilage and other parts of the finger, so it can’t and all that specialized growth is lost.
Is fat and muscle are able to store water in different quantities? So the scales send a low-voltage current through you and measure the resistance, which can indicate various features of your body composition. For more information, see:
They don't. Babies don't breathe until they're born, and until then, oxygen is transferred from the lungs of the mother to the umbilical cord.
Not really, but it is compared to all other animals alive or found in the fossil record. If ever we find a lizard that is bigger, we’ll have to change the school books.
Without a constant flow of oxygen-rich blood, the tissues will not survive. They will be fine for a while, but yes, there’s no way around it.
Therefore, saturated fats have all the double bonds between carbon atoms as single bonds. An unsaturated fat has one or more double bonds between carbon atoms. A monosaturated fat has only one double bond. A polysaturated fat has two or more double bonds. A monosaturated fat is mono, like a monosyllabic, like monorail or monotone. A polysaturated fat is poly, like polygon.
Probably because if you have chills you could have a fever, and bundles could make it worse.
- Starvation mode is partly a myth, just like "two hours after the end of the gym drinking a shake to hit the anabolic window"... It's not like turning a switch. It's not either you're in starvation mode or not. As you lower your calories, your body will spend less energy while resting. When you reduce your calories a little, your resting calories will decrease a little, when you reduce your calories a lot, your resting calories will decrease a lot. There is no point at which you will definitely be in starvation mode. I don't really like this expression because it's not really a "mode", it's the effect of consuming fewer calories than burning, and the effect grows in proportion to the difference.
dentist here. It’s because baby teeth are small and only 20 develop, whereas adults have 32. There’s plenty of space for the baby teeth to grow in the mouth, even when the bones are tiny, compared to the adult with his 32 teeth, a monster if you like. Adult teeth begin to grow in when we’re six years old, but our jaws haven’t developed yet, so it’s quite normal for teeth to start growing in crooked when we’re six, but they usually grow in less crooked as we grow up. Also, permanent teeth don’t always grow in the “right” place, so they can grow in sideways, twisted or right on top of each other. There are also other reasons, which are a bit complicated to explain.
The esophagus and trachea (windpipe) are connected to each other in the back of the mouth, and since the mouth is used both for eating and breathing, the windpipe closes when we swallow to prevent fluids and solids from entering the lungs.
Because the body has too much fluid, which it cannot handle. The kidneys cannot excrete enough of it, the blood vessels are too narrow or damaged, the heart cannot pump blood as it should, and blood and fluids flow back to the lungs. Any one or all of these conditions may produce the same symptom. The excess fluid accumulates in the lungs where it interferes with the exchange of gases and thus directly causes hypoxemia—just as it does in cases of drowning, when water stands where the lungs need air.
It varies with age and with each individual. But generally speaking, you should sleep for an average of four to five hours at a stretch. Depending on the individual’s physical condition, some doctors may recommend as few as three to four hours of sleep per night. This refers to the time you actually spend asleep; the hours you spend lying in bed are not included. General recommendations based on age can be found in this chart. In answer to your second question, generally speaking, yes. The way people sleep is essentially the same, but the precise length of the sleep cycles and how many of them you must complete to achieve adequate rest will vary somewhat.
Connective tissue. You might think of each organ as having its own little net. Each organ hangs from the next in a chain, each chain from the skeleton. It would be like tying a bunch of jigsaw puzzles together and hanging them from a beam.
Your premises are wrong. There are over a thousand different kinds of bananas besides the common Cavendish. The banana I like best is the blue-skinned Java variety, but there are also rosy-fingered, manzano, burro, etc.
“You” are not the molecules that make you up, but rather the arrangement of those molecules. Similarly, memories are the pattern of the connections between brain cells. If all the cells of a connection are replaced by new ones, but the new cells are connected in the same way, then the memory also remains intact. If you are still not clear, here’s an analogy. Suppose you have a Lego kit, let’s say, of the Batmobile. If you disassemble it, you have all the pieces, but no longer a Batmobile. If you go buy the same pieces and put them in place, the end result is a Batmobile but none of the pieces are the original pieces. Your memory is the Batmobile, not the pieces.
Imagine that you have a map of the United States, but you don't know how many states it has. And even if you had mapped the borders of a few states, you could only approximate the number of states from the sizes of the ones you've found. But you wouldn't know the exact number of states, or their locations, sizes, or shapes. To find out, you would actually have to go through every state and map the borders. But then you would only have the physical dimensions of the states. You wouldn't know, for instance, what political system it has, or its culture, or what its major imports and exports are, or what it does for the rest of the country. And that's what happened with the genes. We knew the size of the molecule, we knew a few of the genes, but we could only guesstimate the number of genes. So we mapped it, we crawled over the entire molecule and mapped out what it was and where it was. But we don't know yet what each individual gene does or how it contributes to the formation of a human being.
It's the body's way of telling you to stop poisoning yourself for a while and let it recuperate. Alcohol also interferes with memory, so you don't remember anything from the previous night. I've had blackouts before, but it was at the beach. And I forgot to drink water. The next day was horrible.
It is determined by the structure of the eye, more precisely, the pigmented cells of the retina. The more types of cells and the wider their range of sensitivity, the more colors it can see. If there are fewer pigmented cells, or no pigment at all, the color vision is poorer.
Most pregnancy tests are based on what is called a lateral flow assay. (In simple terms, this means that a liquid flows on a piece of paper—not helped by gravity or any other force.) The liquid is being tested for a certain hormone that is produced in the blood after the fertilized egg has been implanted in the uterus. If this hormone is present in the liquid, it means that you are pregnant (or that something very wrong is happening). In the paper of the test there are antibodies—the same ones that are part of your immune system and help it to recognize bacteria and other bad guys. These antibodies bind to the paper and recognize the hormone, which does not flow with the rest of the urine. But it doesn’t go away, it just concentrates in one spot. Now you don’t know yet whether the hormone is there or not because it’s not visible yet, but the next step involves another type of antibody that binds to the concentrated hormone, and this binding is what causes the color to appear. Interestingly enough, lateral flow assays are some of the most common tests. They are really simple ways of looking for a specific compound in the body. For example, if you wanted to check whether someone had chickenpox, you could make a lateral flow assay that looks for traces of the virus in the nasal discharges—and we do actually check for that.
Soma is Greek for body. Somatic means bodily. Visceralis is Latin for internal organs. Nociceptive means the physiological stimulation of pain-sensitive organs. So the difference is between pain in the internal organs and pain in the rest of the body. The reason we distinguish them is that the nerve response in the internal organs is not as specific as the nerve response in the rest of the body. The pain is less well localized, not as definite, not as sharp, as in the case of an injury or a wound.
Usually these parasites do not enter the body as they are. It is more likely that you eat their eggs or their cysticerci (which are like eggs, but they are produced in the muscles of pigs and cattle in the form of a cyst). These two are resistant to digestion, both acid and enzymatic. When they get through the stomach, the eggs and cysticerci end up in a more hospitable environment in the small intestine, and they hatch and develop into real parasites, such as tapeworms, roundworms, pinworms, etc. I invite you to look at pictures of human parasite life cycles to get an idea of the big picture.
They do not hum. They flutter about you all around, looking for a place to bite. You only hear them when they are right next to your ear, because they are small and the humming sound they produce is very high-pitched and dissipates very quickly through the air.
hydrogen peroxide burns by oxidizing the organic molecules. That white/waxy stuff is what the organic molecules become. The waxy stuff is like the clear stuff that your skin produces after a regular blister or something to help the healing process.
The actual alcohol is not what causes the hangover. What does is that there are many less expensive alcohols, including some of the popular ones (yes, I'm looking at you, Casamigos and Tres Marias), that have a lot of additives, such as sweeteners, flavorings, and dyes, which, in my opinion, add to the hangover.
If you look at a reflection, you are really looking at distant objects. You can see the difference if you look at a dirty mirror. If you look at the reflection, you can see the dirt in it. In this respect, the reflection is different from the mirror.
You have bacteria in your mouth. All living things poop. The bacteria are pooping in your mouth.
Not by whether it can be cured but whether we can cure it. Treating symptoms is relatively easier than finding the cure.
Because your body knows there’s something in your throat or on your palate that needs to come out or go down. So it makes more saliva to help the object along. It’s the same with vomiting. Saliva acts as a lubricant to help things pass. That’s why the body makes more of it when something is stuck or needs to come out or go down.
Yes, and no. In a nutshell, the body needs a lot of hormones to grow facial hair, and those hormones do not reach maturity until the age of twenty-five. Consider puberty like a car. Starting the car is only the beginning. It takes some time to reach top speed.
It was a mistranslation and a misinterpretation of the facts. It is true that there is some difference in the distribution of taste buds on the tongue, but this is not significant. But when the scientific article about it was translated from German to English and then taught in the English universities, these differences were exaggerated. Afterwards it was translated into a textbook, and then it was assumed that the tongue had taste areas. Since this was regarded as a fact, no one challenged it. And since it wasn't a particularly important field, no one got the funds to study it further.
Adrenaline and epinephrine are the same. Noradrenaline and norepinephrine are the same. They are different names for the same thing. The name “adrenaline” is used more in European medicine and “epinephrine” in American medicine. They do a very similar job. But norepinephrine is more of a steady level, and epinephrine is more of a stress response. Norepinephrine constricts blood vessels, keeping blood pressure up. Epinephrine constricts more and so increases blood pressure if it needs to. Epinephrine is used in the treatment of anaphylactic shock because when the body goes into shock, blood pressure drops.
This is at least a two-fold question. First, in general, more solids dissolve in hot water than in cold. If you put sugar in hot coffee, it dissolves in the liquid with just a few stirs. But in iced coffee you stir for a long time and the sugar stays in clumps. And since the purpose of cleaning is to dissolve dirt in water, it helps if the water is more soluble. Second, while things like oils don't really dissolve in water, hot water does make them less sticky and the water and the friction more easily remove them. Hot water alone can remove most of the oil from a cast-iron pan. Cold water, on the other hand, seems to thicken the oil.
Most glues dry up by: a) Emitting a part of their liquid components, b) Adsorbing and reacting with something in the air, c) Containing a solid component that reacts with the air. d) Reacting with a different component in the glue, which mixes in as the glue is used. All these reactions are prevented as long as the glue is in the container.
It doesn’t get sticky because of long freezing time. What you say is exactly what happens when a kid licks a frozen metal pole and gets his tongue stuck to it. The moisture on his tongue freezes on the frozen pole, making them stick together. As for ice, the moisture on your fingertips freezes on a fresh ice cube. But when the ice is not frozen any more, the moisture on your fingers will be unable to freeze on it.
First of all, methadone is an opiate and thus completely different from the other two. Second, meth and methylphenidate are tangentially related only insofar as they are both stimulants and can be used for some of the same reasons. Meth is an amphetamine, methylphenidate is a phenidate. They work by different mechanisms, and are radically different in chemical composition. Meth increases dopamine; methylphenidate acts as a DRI (dopamine-releasing imitator) and thus allows your brain’s natural dopamine to build up to higher concentrations. When used medicinally, neither meth nor methylphenidate is especially harmful. Meth is a prescription drug sold under the brand name Desoxyn. Meth is only dangerous because people who abuse it take literally hundreds of times the prescribed dose. Like all drugs, the dose makes the poison, so don’t worry, you’re fine.
If there are any foreign bodies in your water, like branches or leaves, your chlorine will attack them. In this process, your chlorine will be used up. The ultra-violet rays emitted by the sun affect chlorine in a very strong way. The chlorine ions are ionized, and are finally burned up. Moreover, water evaporates from the pool. With the water evaporated, the loss of chemicals is proportionate.
The fire needs three things: fuel, heat and oxygen. The heat of a small fire, like a lit match out of a burning candle, is not much, so if you blow on it, you cool it down and stop the flame. In contrast, the low embers of a big fire still have a lot of heat left, but not much oxygen. You add more fuel, blow to add oxygen, and the fire flares up and gets bigger.
Using wine-making as an analogy, which is a little different because wines are based on the vintage, that is, each year's harvest, they work with the millions of liters of the finished product from the individual harvests, and then they combine each tank. You may start out with a thousand different tanks, but when you've mixed them all together, you have a million liters of the same thing.
A: They're not the same; they're similar names for extremely different things, because humans like to use confusing names. Take a look at these structures: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins#Molecule_functions None of them are even remotely similar, which means they have nothing in common chemically.
I never heard of that. Is it true? Water has to be cold before it can freeze, so how does it work?
I'm not a researcher in this field, but I've read a lot about ADHD. If it is a reduction in the brain's ability to produce dopamine, medication does not really fix that. The medicine merely enables the brain to produce more dopamine, which helps manage the symptoms of ADHD. I think for a more "long-term" cure, we would have to be able to correct the brain's ability to produce dopamine, and I don't think we know how to do that yet.
It is a well-known problem. That's one reason why Teflon cookware is so brittle, and why it's important to take care of it. The standard process is to blast the pan so that it has a rough surface, then to spray it with a thin layer of Teflon which penetrates the surface. And you can layer more Teflon on top of that, because Teflon sticks to Teflon. To make a long story short, it's difficult and we're still not very good at it.
Well, it's very simple. Some molecules can show a 'hand.' The so-called 'carbon atom,' for instance, with four different sorts of 'arrangements' (whatever they may be), has two ways of being arranged. And these two arrangements can't be turned into each other by a twist of the wrist. They are enantiomers, just as your left hand and your right hand are enantiomers. Such an atom is called a 'Stereo Center.' This has an effect on the chemistry of the molecule, mainly on its power to rotate polarized light. (I'll just give you the example of sugar.)
Liquids don't burn, only vapors. To make vapor, you have to heat it to boiling. This is because it takes oxygen to burn, and oxygen must be in its gaseous state to break its chemical bond. Even if you could inject a hot bubble of oxygen into the liquid, the flame would quickly consume the oxygen, and there would be no continuous burn. And even then, you're still burning a gas.
No they don't. Oxygen is just so incredibly plentiful and is of such a good chemical reactivity. Fluorine is much more oxidizing than oxygen but it is so oxidizing you never find it in elemental form.
Composting doesn’t create methane, while burying food in a garbage dump does. The difference is oxygen. It is only in an environment with low oxygen, such as being deep in a garbage dump and inside a plastic bag, that decomposition can occur. Without oxygen, only anaerobic bacteria can grow and ferment food, producing methane gas. A comparable phenomenon occurs in bread-making: if you mix the yeast with oxygen and then put the dough into the oven, it can ferment, but it does not produce alcohol. So, there is no methane gas in composting just as there is no alcohol in bread. “Why not?” you ask.
: It's a mixture of urban legend and racism. MSG is safe. You're actually eating it right now, because it's in things like cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes, etc.
Thats because the boiling point and freezing point of water are easy to measure and can be used as convenient reference points in daily life. The distance between the two is determined by the air pressure on the planet earth at sea level, and the distance between the freezing point of water and absolute zero is determined by the properties of water. It's not an artificially chosen value, but a value that was measured.
The purpose of a plastic bag or foil wrapping is to keep the oxygen from reaching the product. This prevents the decomposition process.
It’s an acid inside your body, too. It burns you because you have too much acid lining your esophagus, not your stomach.
Controlled variable is held constant, like the lollipop, if you're using the same lollipop in different liquids. If you're using more than one lollipop and more than one liquid, then you've got a multivariate experiment, which is much more complicated. At present you have the independent variable (type of liquid). The dependent variable (time for the lollipop to dissolve). The controlled variable (assuming the lollipop is always the same) is the lollipop.
The simplified (and perhaps oversimplified) explanation is that adults tend to have the same amount of blood, regardless of their weight. So the blood concentration of, for example, paracetamol in adults is the same regardless of their weight.
Caffeine is caffeine. The only difference is the quantity. In coffee, the caffeine content is much higher per volume than in tea.
I've never heard of this legend. In general, though, there are many legends about drinking and its consequences. I have heard that vodka is a “purer” drink than scotch, so it is easier on the body; I have also heard that vodka is a killer. One's own chemistry is individual, and it also changes daily. What may make one vomit after one party, may not make one vomit the next.
To answer the question of similarity in name, they both, like all the radi- words (radius, radiant, even “ray”), derive from the same basic Latin concept of “something that goes from one thing to another,” especially something that goes out. The concept of “radiation” is an old one; this random letter from 1819 complains about the lack of understanding of “caloric radiation” (i.e. heat). The Curies coined the term radioactivity in French in 1898 to describe those things that seemed to give off this new kind of radiation. In the 1860s James Clerk Maxwell formulated what we now call radio waves, and Heinrich Hertz proved their existence in the 1880s, but for a while they were known as “Hertz waves.” Not until about 1910 did we start using the term “radio wave” to refer to them generally. Also, “radium” gets its name from “radioactive” because it’s an element (the “-ium”) that’s radioactive. So they are related, but not all together; some are derivatives of others, some are just sharing the same roots.
most medicines are complex molecules, and not long-lasting stable. Because of the change of nature, because of temperature changes, oxidation, etc., etc., many of them are decomposed, and some of them don't work well, and some are no longer useful.
hydrogen is not created from thin air, so to speak. It has to be manufactured in sufficient quantities, which in the current state of the art means either electrolysis of a lot of water (which defeats the purpose), or a lot of fossil fuels have to be refined.
We’re programmed to like indicators of nutrition, energy, and other useful substances that may be difficult to obtain. Like sugar, fats, salt. Burned foodstuffs do not usually have those values, and so they do not have the indicators: sweetness. A sour taste. A salty taste.... And spoiled foodstuffs have toxic bacteria and other poisons, so we are programmed to avoid and dislike them, and their indicators, like the odor and the taste of spoiled food.
As a rule, less. The browning of toast is the result of a process called the Maillard reaction, which occurs when the sugars and the protein in food get hot enough to interact. There is good evidence that the Maillard reaction reduces the caloric and nutritional value of food, and that the products of the reaction may have some toxic effects [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4745522), [2](https://www.ac.uk/emc/text-pages/Wu-1-e-3-l-yys-le-touf-ton-tor-e- ad.[3][4] (https://www. ucanr.edu/datastore/files/608-648.pdf)
A: The amount of minerals in the water. Hard water, in particular, has a higher proportion of dissolved lime. Softening systems take out the lime and also often the iron and other minerals, and sometimes replace them with salt.
A: Fission bombs produce energy by splitting atoms. This means that you take a substance such as uranium, bombard it with so many neutrons that the atoms become unstable isotopes and are subject to radioactive decay. During this decay, they lose protons and neutrons, becoming a new atom, and in the process, they give off heat and energy.
The 3rd shell is capable of holding 18 but if the 1st and 2nd shell are full, then the next 8 to be added will be shifted to the 3rd but there are already so many of them in there that it’s more energy efficient to fill the 4th. And when 2 are in the 4th, then the next 10 will be shifted to the 3rd.
It is not correct to say there is no heat. Your marble counter is at a temperature above absolute zero (K), or, to be precise, above 0°C (273 K), since you are not a polar bear and your water is not a frozen mass. And actually water (and ice too—as shown by the frost in a good chest freezer) cannot be maintained without heat. In a closed container of the same air temperature, some of the water will evaporate to maintain equilibrium, that is, to reach a vapor pressure at that temperature. The water-vapor pressure will reach equilibrium if we put the water in a sealed container and leave it at the same temperature. If the bottle is empty when you return, you know someone has drunk it or poured it out. Now, your dark bathroom may be closed in as far as the door is concerned, but it is not closed in a physical sense since the air circulates. With time, the air currents carry away the water vapor constantly forming on the surface of the water drops. Then more water vapor forms to replace it, and the liquid disappears. Here is an example of the principle of Le Chatelier: If you disturb an equilibrium between two phases (A and B) by adding or removing either of the phases, then the whole system will change so as to regain equilibrium. Here the circulating air takes away the water vapor and more is formed.
It is not fire in the ocean. It is gas escaping from a ruptured tube, and being set afire when it emerges from the water.
Imagine the hydrogen atom, a proton and a revolving electron. It has a net charge of zero, but the proton and the electron are separate. If I grab the electron and stick it to the left of the proton, there is a minus on the left where the electron is and a plus on the right where the proton is. This is called polarity, a little like north and south poles on a magnet, only it is electrical charge instead of magnetic. Now imagine a water molecule: the oxygen atom hugs the hydrogen atom and the hydrogen atom hugs the oxygen atom, so the side next to the oxygen is minus, the opposite side plus. And the presence of the hydrogen atom’s electrons repels the oxygen atom’s existing ones to the opposite side. So water is polar, one side a little plus, the other a little minus. This polarity is quite strong and it is why water loves to dissolve things like salt, its polarity is strong enough to break the salt molecule. Polarity is closely related to bond angles. The minus and plus sides of a molecule all push and pull on each other and eventually they achieve equilibrium.
We have a circulating oxygen supply in hospitals, but it is in liquid form, so there is a fixed amount. Since hospitals use it in this form, oxygen tank suppliers are in great demand. They not only have to supply oxygen to hospitals, but they also have to make sure that they have enough oxygen to last a few more months. As for the question of removing oxygen from the air, yes it is possible, but the problem is that this extraction can only be done with machines that concentrate oxygen, and the trouble is that they extract only 95% oxygen, whereas patients need to get 100%. Also, I haven't directly worked with the oxygen-concentrating machines, because fortunately our hospital has not had a lot of need for them. But I imagine that it takes a while to get a usable supply of oxygen. (Editor's note: Corrected typo and type of gas)
Those reactions devour heat energy and change it into mass by way of bond energy. The surroundings become cooler, because the energy that created those bonds has been transformed into something other than heat.
You yourself answered this question, that they need photosynthesis, and that requires sunlight (or other sources of light, which produce more CO2 than they take in), which means that you would have to create large open-top tanks full of shallow water and a suitable mixture of nutrients. We would probably have to install air pumps as well, which use energy and produce CO2, to increase the oxygenation and speed up the growth. And we would have to have pumps to add water to counteract evaporation. It would all use up more energy and CO2 ; you can do the same thing with a large surface area of solar cells and with less CO2 produced.
Plant milk is bacteria-free in its original state, but once opened, the product is exposed to the environment, and to maintain its freshness for a longer time, we recommend putting it in the fridge.
Biological matter contains a lot of carbon (it forms the basis of almost all organic molecules) and hydrogen (it sticks to most of the carbon atoms) and a whole bunch of other things. Biological molecules are generally large and not very stable, so under heat and pressure they tend to disintegrate. If oxygen is around or anaerobic bacteria (which work without oxygen), they will eat the organic molecules, reducing them to simple molecules, to extract their energy. But if there is no oxygen or bacteria, like in the case of kerogen, there is only so far that organic molecules can be reduced; they then get stuck, because there is nothing around that will react with them and reduce them even further. They are as simple as they can be, with the energy available, until they hit on something stable. That is the oil. We dig it up, introduce oxygen, and reduce it further.
If water were to have no salt in it, it would not be enjoyable to drink. You can buy such water in any market under the name triple-distilled water. A small amount of salt and minerals is necessary to make the water taste good. If there is too much salt or mineral, the water will taste too salty or "hard."
Detergents clean by physical means. Detergent molecules are long and thin, and one end dissolves in water and the other does not. The other end adheres to the soiled particles and forms a kind of shell, so that the dissolved end of the molecules is all on the outside and dissolves the soiled particles, so that the soiled particles are carried away by the water. Stain removers work by chemical means. They have a chemical reaction with the stains, which either separates them from the fabric or changes their color.
There are two things in an aerosol can, the product and the propellant. The propellant is a special chemical substance that is liquid at the temperature and pressure inside the can, but a gas outside the can. When you shake them together, when you open the valve, the liquid propellant turns to gas and some of the product goes with it. If you don’t shake it, you could get a lot of gas and no product.
Because it’s not really cooling your coffee, it’s “flash freezing” it. You freeze your coffee, and it stays the same strength and has more energy to react when you just stick it in the frig. If you want to see this phenomenon in a more visible way, get a bottle of (good) Scotch, put a shot in the freezer/frig, one room temp (neat), one neat with a drop of water, one neat over ice, and one neat with water over ice. You will get very different flavors and notes from each one, please sip it, don’t down it. If you want to get super-fancy, you can also compare the same bottle divided between decanters and straight from the bottle in the same ways. You can do the same with coffee, but generally the changes are less radical.
Despite the greater distance between vapor and skin, vapor is still capable of causing a great deal of damage. But if it does not condense on the skin, it is not very painful. If you place your hand over a pan of boiling water, you will only get burned if you stay there long enough for the water to condense on your skin.
It is produced by burning a fossil fuel like coal or gas. However, the problem with this method is that fossil fuels are often not pure enough to produce food-grade co2 without being first extensively cleaned, and then it must be extremely carefully distilled. For example, when burning coal, co2 is contaminated with toxic elements like mercury, benzene and other things, which are difficult to remove, and are absolutely unsuitable for food — but perhaps suitable for a fire extinguisher or some other industrial application. Rather, food-grade co2 is produced by capturing and cleaning up waste from certain chemical processes, where the chemicals are already very pure and the waste co2 is also very pure. One example is the production of ammonia (for fertilizer). The reaction for producing ammonia requires very pure hydrogen, which is refined and chemically treated from natural gas. The process for making hydrogen also produces a very pure co2 by-product, which can be captured as food-grade co2. The production of ethyl alcohol for blending with gasoline also produces a very pure co2 from the yeast fermentation process, and can also be used to produce food-grade co2.
It's perfectly possible to dye the air, but the dye must also be a gas of similar density. Otherwise, a denser dye (which, under the atmospheric conditions on Earth, would be all liquids and solids) will sink and clump to the bottom, while a lighter one will rise to the top. But chlorine gas is quite heavy and will remain in the air for a long time, so it can be seen coming toward the trenches quite clearly.
In essence, it is a very small piece of slightly radioactive material in a closed box. The box is lead-lined and has a window. Then there is an air gap and a very simple Geiger counter. When the Geiger counter falls below a certain count per minute, something in the air gap is blocking the radiation and the alarm is sounded. It cannot distinguish between smoke and steam. Given enough steam, it will go off.
There is. Alcohol-free wine is just a juice. The alcohol comes from the sugar fermenting. So if you don’t ferment it, it’s just juice. Alcohol-free wine is just grape juice.
The pills contain the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and inert compounds which also serve as a vehicle to deliver the medicine. Some people, especially children, find it difficult to swallow large pills, and so do not take their medicine. On the other hand, smaller pills are more difficult to handle, especially for the elderly who have less dexterity and poorer vision. But the size of the pills also depends on the required dosage. If a single dose of a drug requires a large amount of the API or inert compounds, they are sometimes divided into two smaller pills. Generally speaking, patients prefer a single pill per dose, as they may forget to take more than one pill at a time (older patients) or refuse to take several (children).
A liquid is the state of matter in which there is a definite quantity but no definite form. A solid is the state of matter in which there is a definite quantity and a definite form.
hay is made of fresh, chopped plants. In moist conditions, the plants begin to decompose, and fungi, bacteria, and other microbes thrive. These microbes and organisms, being alive, produce heat. The hay itself traps the heat and prevents it from escaping. When the temperature reaches about 53°C, the moisture and microbes undergo chemical changes, which also release heat. Then, at about 122°C, chemical reactions take place which also release heat. In comparison, paper ignites at about 230°C.
When you pour water on a grease fire, the water splashes on the oil and flashes to steam because the oil is burning at a higher temperature than water, and the steam blows the oil into the air, where the tiny oil drops can be burned.
What is called a "solvent" is a kind of material that can dissolve another kind of material. If A dissolves in B, the molecules of A are all in B, and B is also saturated with A. The smudge of salt and sugar can be easily removed by water. Water is a solvent, and after cleaning, water is not clean water, but salt water or sugar water. In the same way, when you use a solvent to clean, the oil you clean is dissolved in the solvent, and you don't have a clean solvent, but you have a dirty solvent (which is usually thrown away).
What we perceive as colour is different wavelengths of light reflected from an object. What colours an object is that its atoms absorb certain wavelengths (photons interact with the atoms’ electrons and change their energy state) and reflect other wavelengths. The technical name for this is spectroscopy. Astronomers use this to determine what stars are made of by studying the light they emit.
It depends on the acid and the substance that is to be dissolved. Everything that is not oxygen does not just vanish. Certain plastics and rubbers are insoluble in most acids. So you have to either disintegrate them one by one or throw together all sorts of acids and hope that everything will dissolve. But then you have a pool of dangerous acid and you have to be careful that no one falls into it or that it does not seep elsewhere, into the rivers or a kindergarten.
The wax is the fuel. As in the case of petrol, it burns. In this case, paraffin plus oxygen makes CO2 and smoke.
Some medicines require that they be taken after a meal, because on an empty stomach they may cause nausea or stomach ache. Other medicines require the opposite, that they be taken on an empty stomach, because the precise dose may be influenced by food or the vitamins and other substances in the food may react with the medicine.
The magnetic property of iron does not occur in the atom. It is only when many atoms are grouped together in a certain crystal form. The heme-iron (iron of the blood which transports the oxygen) contains only one iron atom, therefore it is not ferromagnetic.
? They soak up the fragrance of the barrel. Cheap liquor is usually watered-down alcohol with artificially flavored additives and sometimes dyes. The author was making his own liquor at home, and had read many books about making liquor.
Sodium is extremely eager to be united with chlorine. This burning is the union. And they live happily together. Once they have achieved this union, unless with great effort, they cannot be separated. But then, in a very devoted way, sodium immediately enters the bed of the first tawdry anion it encounters. Sodium is very thirsty, but very faithful.
They don't really exist. Yellow is a hard color to directly produce at high power. There are some for traffic lights, but that doesn't seem to be what you're looking for. You can see the spectra of commonly available LEDs on page 15 of this datasheet. "PC amber" is not completely lacking in 580nm, but the peak is at 590nm. They're very similar to the ones I recommended last time.
The powder contains two chemicals, baking soda and citric acid or another acid, which, when they are dissolved in water, react and produce carbon dioxide. This is the same reaction used to make model volcanoes at school. They are just mixed in a dry form and they only start reacting when they are dissolved in water. But it is not actually a carbonated drink because the bubbles do not enter the water and dissolve like a soda. They just bubble up.
We put the mould (penicillium) into a vat with water and all the food and chemicals it needs to grow. It grows and makes the desired chemical (penicillin). When it has made as much as it can, we start the extraction process. It is a complicated process of separating out the mould and all the other chemical waste by filtering it and a chemical extraction process. This is where the water and all the other dissolved chemicals are separated. Then we have a crystal of penicillin.
First, molten aluminium is that which is molten at any temperature above its own. So if you heat aluminium to above iron's melting point, it will still be molten. But it doesn't have to be heated that high. When you put the iron into the molten aluminium, the surface of the iron reacts with the aluminium and forms an aluminium-iron alloy, which might have a melting point below the aluminium and so it will melt. And so you expose more iron to the molten aluminium and the process continues.
It depends. Some sunblock reflects the sun's rays, which means no energy is absorbed by the skin. Some absorb the light and convert it to heat energy. The heat may be uncomfortable, but it will not destroy organic molecules, which is what causes sunburn. But we must remember that sunburn is not like a regular burn from a stove.
2) the atoms that make up the two substances are different. One of the molecules is left-handed, the other right-handed. And I think you can’t turn a left-handed molecule into a right-handed molecule without changing it. 3) So even though they affect the same parts of the brain, they don’t affect them in the same way. Adderal helps the frontal lobe in a person with ADHD. Meth stimulates everything at once.
Bacteria multiply in food, but they require two conditions to multiply. They need both oxygen and heat to do it. If you package a product under vacuum, you cut down on the oxygen. The only problem is that if there are any imperfections in the vacuum seal, like a large pocket of air in a meat cavity, the effect of the vacuum is much reduced. But the vacuum sealing in a supermarket is much more precise than it is at home. If they don't do the butchering, they will have much better vacuum equipment than most of us have at home. The other factor is heat. Basically, if the temperature goes below a certain point, the bacteria growth will slow down considerably, though it won't stop. But if you raise the temperature above that point for a while (for instance from the time you take it off the display to the time you put it in your refrigerator) then the bacteria have a chance to multiply. Even if you put it back into the cold, it has already multiplied more than if it had stayed in the cold all that time.
Slightly more than four hundred years ago, the Isotope Center was established. Isotopes of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen accumulate in the keratin in the nails and hair of humans, the ratio of which is determined by their diet, and as keratin is a very stable substance, it can be used to determine the region where a person is from. I don't know if there is any overlap in the results, but it's not impossible. I know this is used to determine the migration patterns of animals. But I didn't know it was also used in forensics, as human beings don't eat only local food, which makes isotope analysis a lot harder.
Boiled eggs are a different sort of animal than pasta. In boiling water pasta absorbs water and in doing so becomes slightly more liquid than it was before (when it was completely dry). Water soaks into the spaces between the starch molecules and makes them more liquid, making the pasta soft.
The burned food is in fact a completely different kind of food, because it has the highest proportion of burnt sugars and charred urea. Burned food is thus, by definition, overwhelmingly bitter; all other tastes are lost in the insipid acridity.
The sudden change in temperature is a stress to the object, in this case the ice. Every object has its maximum tensile strength, the strain a material can withstand before it breaks. When hot water is poured over ice, it produces a shock or stress, and if the stress exceeds the tensile strength of the ice, it breaks.
There are a lot of different drinks from coffee trees. The highest pressure is a shot of water, and it's very troublesome to make. A good machine can extract it completely and evenly. The worst machine makes drip coffee. I think there is no big difference between the so-called drip coffee machines, because this is the machine you think about: hot water is dropped from the top and comes out at the bottom. The best ones will imitate the process of pouring water, and most of them will just drip. Higher-level ones can be set up to automatically make coffee in the morning and wake up to drink fresh coffee, but it doesn't get any better. It's a dripping coffee machine. There are many ways to make drip coffee. The French press, the aeropress, the mizapan, and so on, will produce different coffee.
It is because you always start with the number 2.3. To get the result you want, 0.00023, you have to divide 2.3 by 10000. And dividing 2.3 by 10000 is the same as saying dividing 2.3 by 1/1000. 10000 is equal to 104, 1/1000 to 1/100. And 104 can be changed to -104 by multiplying by 104 to get 104.
If you have perfectly clean glasses and perfectly pure water, and you freeze it, it won't freeze, but it'll cool down and be super-cold, because it's so pure. But as soon as something taints it, it'll freeze instantly. It's like a quick-boil.
Lead has a lot of good properties. It makes paint dry faster, make it last longer, and make it more resistant to moisture. Lead is a wonderful thing, unless it comes to human health.
The main difference is that the prescription is paid for by the insurance company. Otherwise the difference is only the recommended dosage.
There are two basic reasons: one is the volume, the other is the type of combustion. When a candle burns, the smoke is burned and hardly anything but water vapor and carbon dioxide escapes. But cigarette smoking isn’t a burn at all, it’s a very dirty pyrolisis, where the heat of the flame decomposes the tobacco and makes a great deal of smoke that isn’t burned. This smoke contains a large percentage of aromatic hydrocarbons, a class of heavy, viscous, carcinogenic, and odoriferous hydrocarbons. It’s the same thing when you smoke anything else, such as hashish. But whereas people may smoke a joint together, a tobacco smoker will turn his twenty or more cigarettes into carcinogenic tar a day.
I have thought about it, haven’t I?
rather it is a definite, tangible thing. Some bond-breaking reactions require energy, others do not, an exothermic reaction or an endothermic reaction. vibration and heat have the same function.
Because the time it would take to decay completely would be infinite. If it takes 10 years for 1 kg to decay into 0.5 kg, then it will take another 10 years for 0.25 kg, and yet another 10 years for 0.125 kg. In theory, it will never decrease to 0 kg. But it is the half-life that is a fixed measurement. For instance, the half-life of 1 kg of uranium is the same as the half-life of 100 kg.
But fire requires an oxidizer. Oxygen is the only natural oxidizer, but there are some others which are produced in the laboratory, and some are quite inventive. Chlorine trifluoride is a powerful oxidizer and oxidizes everything: sand, stone, engines, asbest. So the most practical weapon against a fire which does not use oxygen is a good pair of running shoes.
Best guess is that the metal is freeing oils from the metal and oxidizing them, just as a blackened cast-iron pan will acquire a lustrous golden layer as it is first seasoned, before the seasoning is fully completed and it develops its usual blackish patina. My second best guess is that the color is oxidized nickel—hot nickel reacts easily with oxygen in a torch flame. But the oxidized nickel is a greenish yellow color, not golden. But these are just guesses, and no one will really know without more information.
- Sulfuric acid is decomposed by nitric acid to produce a nitrate ion.
Crack is cocaine sprayed with a great deal of a baking soda solution. It’s not that it’s better than cocaine, but it’s ready to smoke. Smoking coke hits you much harder than snorting. The fact is, however, that a lot of coke is probably synthesised, because other chemicals are much cheaper. Crack could well be manufactured from this non-coke quite often. So keep away from all street drugs! You never know what it’s made of. Fentanyl is killing people at an incredible rate.
A mole is defined as approximately 6.02214  1023 of a substance, usually an ion, a molecule, an atom, or something of that nature. Now, as an example of its importance, suppose you are combining sodium chloride and chloride to make salt. You need one mole of sodium and one mole of chloride to make two moles of sodium chloride. Using gram equivalents, you will not get this. If you instead use moles, you will get the same result: one mole of sodium reacts with one mole of chloride to make one mole of sodium chloride. One mole of sodium is about 23 grams, and one mole of chloride is about 35.5 grams.
That’s crazy, it still tastes pretty good! Life pro tip: Cook the Mac and cheese in a skillet with butter on medium heat for 3 minutes, add extra cheese if you have some, and thank me later.
But if you want to have chicken and pork retain their cooked texture, you have to heat them up first.
I don’t know what you mean. The atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, and all of it is at the local room temperature. No molecule has an inherent temperature. Radioactive molecules do raise the temperature of their surroundings, but stable molecules do not retain a fixed temperature. Q: Does nitrogen release a heat?
- Imagine a room full of blindfolded people, with their arms stretched out, trying to hold hands with each other. When they move fast, they can hardly hold hands and are always slamming into each other, close enough to reach for each other's arms. But when they slow down, it's easier to hold hands instead of slamming into a fist. And when they slow down enough, everyone is holding hands and everyone has two whole arms apart from everyone else, instead of squeezing together. That's how water works. The hydrogen bonds want to form, but above 0° C they are too weak to hold. After reaching 0 ° C, with every drop it gets colder, more and more hydrogen bonds are formed and they spread out. And when it freezes, it forms a bigger and stronger latticework in the crystalline structure. I don't have an example of any other substance at this time. Sorry.
Helium is on the atomic scale a very small molecule. By comparison, the oxygen or nitrogen molecule in the air is much bigger. A seal that is airtight, is not necessarily helium-tight, and helium will gradually find its way through the atomic pores in almost any seal we can make. The escape will be slow, but it will happen. The escape will increase with the more seals the helium comes into contact with, such as if the helium is pumped through pipes.
It's just water molecules that stick to the surface of the liquid. This can occur at temperatures below 100 degrees celsius, depending on the wind and the temperature difference between the liquid and the air. But basically wind or dry air can "snatch" the water molecules off the surface of the liquid. At 100 degrees celsius it becomes a forced transition from liquid to gas, even in the deepest parts of the liquid.
The sun doesn’t burn. It does fusion, in which hydrogen is fused into a heavier element. For a fire to burn it requires only an oxidizer—a substance which in the course of the chemical reaction gets reduced.
Yes. Don't be swayed by what people have said—a proton is an atom. Specifically, it is a hydrogen ion. Normally a hydrogen atom is a proton and an electron, but if you strip the hydrogen atom of its electron, what's left is the hydrogen ion, which is still an atom. But in the case of the proton, there's nothing left but the proton. That's why it tastes acidic. The way our tongue tastes things is through ion channels. When an ion goes through those channels, a message is sent to the brain, and the brain responds, and we feel it as taste. Acids have lots of hydrogen ions, so they taste sour. That's how we can literally taste the protons.
First, the probiotic is prescribed as ‘take at regular intervals’, so the probiotic bacteria can be replaced by taking another capsule once the first lot of bacteria have died. Second, antibiotics kill bacteria, even probiotics, but they don’t kill them as fast as Lysol. It takes a few hours to kill bacteria, so there is time for the probiotic bacteria to multiply in your intestine and do some of the digestion for you. It is a matter of dosage. You take enough of the antibiotic to kill the infection, and you take enough of the probiotic bacteria for them to multiply sufficiently, even if some of them are killed by the antibiotic.
Because "the mass of one proton" is not as simple to define as one might think. For it happens that if one breaks a carbon atom—or any atom—down into its constituent protons and neutrons, the protons and neutrons will be heavier than the carbon atom itself. Because they have more energy than the carbon atom, they have more mass according to Einstein's law: E = mc2 . This brings us to a historical fact: there was an earlier definition of the atomic mass unit which used oxygen instead of carbon. But because oxygen has a slightly different binding energy than carbon, and thus a slightly different mass per unit volume, a compromise was made that neither definition should be used. Nonetheless, we could have defined the atomic mass unit as the mass of one proton or a neutron. The choice of carbon seems to have been based largely on the fact that it is a convenient element: it is solid at room temperature and pressure and is fairly inert; one can count the atoms of carbon in things made of it rather easily.
There are a few points to consider. Tastes are sensed with the tongue, and umami is one of them. Flavors are sensed with the nose. Even people who are anosmic to certain tastes can taste them, but they cannot distinguish aromas or other tastes. Umami does not come specifically from just one ingredient. MSG is one of the glutamates (Monosodium glutamate), but not the only one, and even if you include non-glutamate compounds, they will trigger umami. Coming from one ingredient does not necessarily preclude it from being a taste. If you consider sour, for example, it is merely the ionization of hydrogen on the tongue, and nothing else triggers the taste.
it’s probably because of the lower level of dissolved oxygen. It’s the same reason boiled water tastes so weird. Pouring water back and forth between two cups can fix it.
It's basically filtering through an extremely small filter that does not even let ions or substances in solution pass through. It requires enormous pressure to overcome the osmotic pressure that would normally push water molecules through such a membrane from the pure water side to the side where there are dissolved substances, which is why it's called reverse osmosis. And yes, that's pretty much how we get pure water.
The property you mention, that of filling a container, is one of the characteristics of a fluid, which both liquids and gases are.
Ice needs 0° Fahrenheit to melt; liquid water needs 0° Fahrenheit to freeze. But melting the ice takes heat, and heat has to come from somewhere. You can take a big piece of ice and set it out in the room. The ice will melt because it is getting energy from the air. But if you put ice cubes in a cup of water, the water will lose its heat to the ice, and the water will get colder while the ice heats up. If the water can’t warm up enough to melt all the ice, the mixture will stay at 0° Fahrenheit—that is, until the air heats up the water and ice to a higher temperature.
A mole is a number. A very big number, to be sure, but a number nonetheless. It is like “a dozen,” which is a number that means 12. If I tell you to fetch me a dozen bagels, you know I want twelve bagels. If I tell you to fetch me a mole of hydrogen atoms, you know I want 6.02  1023 atoms. The “1.008 grams” means that one mole of hydrogen weighs 1.008 grams. You can have a sample of.00005 grams, because that is less than 1 mole.
Most complex dishes began with simple ones. Picture yourself as an ancient human. All you care about is finding stuff to eat. You chew on the tops of these leafy stalks, and you notice they’re not very tasty, and not very good for you...except that sometimes they’re sweet and delicious. You’re a human, so you’re naturally curious and smart. It doesn’t take you long to figure out that the secret is water and heat. If you heat and wet the seeds, they turn into sweet, delicious malt. Well, you have fire and water, so you can do that. What you end up with is... not what you were looking for, but still quite tasty. And it keeps you full for a very long time. You have invented mush. As time goes by, you notice that different grains behave differently when you add hot water. Someone wonders what would happen if you ground up the seeds before adding the hot water, and you get something that tastes a lot like polenta. Then someone tries grinding the seeds, but grinds it too much, and instead of a paste, it comes out as some kind of goo. They throw the ruined meal into the embers, but later on, they’re hungry, so they poke around in the ashes to see if there’s anything left. They pull out some of the blackened goo and eat it. It tastes like bread, and it’s the best thing they’ve ever eaten. They have invented bread. Bread spreads quickly among the human tribe, because they have invented language. When they come back, the bread has miraculously doubled in size. They won’t understand how it happened for thousands of years, but we know now that it was the wild yeast in the air. They probably think it was the stick they stirred it with—which probably had a lot of wild yeast on it—or something. But more bread is better, and now it’s deliciously light and fluffy and easy to eat. And so on with the other stuff. Yogurt is milk that’s gone sour. And so on and so forth.
Almost all the wines are conceived to be drunk within a few years. Many of the good red wines contain phenolic compounds and other phenols which are quite marked and accentuated in the young wine and bind together with each other, soften, and combine in a way that will bring the wine into a richer and more complex flavor. As many have already said, however, there is a limit where the wine is no longer as enjoyable as before. My advice is to try young, average and older wines to find out what you like best. I am a bit of a wine nerd, but I do not like the very old wines. I prefer my wines to be in the middle young range, that is, usually in years 6-12 after vintage. I think there are enough fruity flavors and there are already some secondary flavors and the structure has softened. If you give me a very young wine and a very old wine, I always prefer the young wine.
Air carries moisture and this can go either in or out of a bag, which is why the food in the bag goes stale.
This is subjective. Maybe it’s a question of how one drinks it and the alcohol content in the liquid, but again—subjective. I mean, a lot of people who drink wine don’t drink it in the same way that, say, people who drink shots of tequila do. And then there are the differences between the more expensive versions of each type of alcohol and the less expensive ones. The production and bottling processes could add complexity to the whole question. There is some vodka that is very expensive and some that is very cheap, and the contents of each, about 99%, are essentially the same: water and alcohol. Perhaps the differences are largely a matter of mentality.
Anaerobic respiration (breathing without oxygen) occurs, producing products like lactic acid and carbon dioxide. Lactic acid lowers the pH of the solution, making it acidic. The acid environment is not favorable for many pathogens and thus enhances the preservation properties of the food.
Cold air is more dense, and remains closer to the ground, allowing the particles to settle there. Combined with the fact that emissions rise with the rise in the use of heating and automobiles, and the decrease in the rain that "washes" the air, it increases the concentration of the particulate matter in the air in winter.
A) It's really dangerous B) It can produce toxic by-products C) Acid is not magic. Eventually whatever it was that was actually eating the garbage would wear out and leave you with a vat of toxic chemicals that would have to be removed anyway.
Is it possible you're just a little bit allergic to chocolate? I've never felt a burning sensation before.
the fermentation of the milk by the bacteria in the cheese makes it produce the gas which makes the holes. This is the same process as makes the holes in bread.
it causes the release of the CO2 absorbed by the liquid. Rather than this gas being carried into your mouth, and the delicious fizz you enjoy as you drink, the gas leaves the liquid in the can, leaving a clear and bland solution.
It’s a matter of consistency and distribution. The dough rises because of the gas produced by fermentation, which gives it its elasticity, and also because of the gluten, which contains the gas. Kneading it again after the rise gives it a finer and more uniform structure, which gives the bread its better flavor and its better structure. If we didn’t do this, we might get a loaf with a denser texture, the air pockets more unevenly distributed. In short, this step gives the yeast more time to do its job, improving the texture and the flavor.
When I looked up some noxious chemical I found that it almost always had some nitrogen in it. Even when it wasn’t, it had some intoxicating or sedative effect. Pure chlorine gas. It’s a confirmation bias; when you have a theory like that, you’re so quick to accept anything that confirms it. Most organic chemistry involves carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen. These atoms are invariably found in all sorts of interesting molecules.
You put less heat into it than you get out, so it is exothermic. But it is made up of smaller reactions, some of which are endothermic, others exothermic, and the latter are “stronger.” That is why fire can maintain itself but needs some kicking off.
Sea salt isn’t just sodium chloride. It is the most important ingredient, but it contains other salts as well, such as potassium chloride, which gives it a different taste and appearance.
Hot water has more space between its molecules, which means it has more space and energy to dislodge dirt.
Sodium fluoride does not turn into hydrofluoric acid when it gets into water, at least not in any significant way, but dissolves like salt (NaCl). If it actually turned into hydrofluoric acid, then salt water should turn into hydrochloric acid and burn you. But since salt water and toothpaste do not burn, there is no doubt that this is not true. As to why it does not happen, the answer is again energy. Chemistry involves the fact that entropy dictates that a substance moves to the state of least energy and the least energy usually corresponds to the least reactivity. Since NaF is much less reactivity than HF, this would mean that the reaction (which is really just dissolving in this case) would strongly prefer the less harmful substance, NaF. It is also well known that mixing HF and nitric acid gives you sodium fluoride and water. In general, if two substances react in a way that is perfectly reversible, that is, the reaction gives a perfect product, then it will not go the other way, because the reaction is much more favorable in the first place and the reversal of the reaction requires a lot of energy. I hope this answers your question, but let me know if you have any more!
Water is a polar molecule—one end has a slight positive charge, the other a slight negative charge. This makes it remarkably good at dissolving substances—it can pull atoms and molecules out of their surroundings and keep them firmly in its grasp. Water is so good at this that it is often called the universal solvent. Salt is NaCl, which has weak ionic bonds, which means that water is particularly good at dissolving salt. It is so good, in fact, that removing all the salt from water is an extremely laborious process. Most sand is silicon dioxide, which is not at all polar and very stable. It doesn’t grab salt molecules, so they stay stuck together.
From what I understand, they usually have a coating that gradually wears away. If you crush or break it up, they no longer have the time-release effect. I can't imagine that people who produce illegal drugs would invest in that, and anyway, it often seems that people want to feel the effect as quickly as possible, which is why cocaine is so often snorted.
This is because the drug level in your blood rises considerably, often above the normal level. This can increase the risk of side effects or alter the effects of the drug. Many medicines are absorbed in the intestine with the help of an important liver enzyme, CYP3A4. Grapefruit juice can block the activity of CYP3A4 in the intestine, which means that the intestine will no longer be able to oxidize the medicine. So there is more medicine in your blood than there should be.
(as soon as blood leaves the body it’s oxygenated, which is why it’s bright red. But oxygenation isn’t why the blood turns brown; but a break down in the cells is why it turns brown.) According to the entry on blood red in the encyclopedia, “As blood dries, the hemoglobin in it gradually changes into a rusty color and, as it dries, the blood cells break down and become rusty.” And “over time, the dried blood changes and gets even darker because of another pigment, hemochromium.” I don’t know if Castile soap does this by itself, but it’s possible that peppermint oil accelerates the drying out of the cells or accelerates the break down of these red pigments. Oh! I just found this: “Peppermint, parsley, and their mixture have powerful radical scavenging and antioxidant activity.” (From this scientific article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/S0570178315x0469). So the hemoglobin in red blood cells acts like a free radical: it picks up oxygen and carries it around, and then it lets go of the oxygen—it can do oxidative damage. I’m not very good at explaining this, and please, anyone who knows more, add, adjust, correct! It seems to me that the strong antioxidant activity of peppermint oil might alter the hemoglobin in your blood, and that might make it brown.
You are confusing vanilla with raspberry. The artificial flavors are created by combining chemicals with inedible ingredients, like paper pulp or petroleum. The goal is to create the same aroma and taste as the natural ones. However, these have to pass stricter safety standards.
It does not absorb, but rather adsorbs moisture. Silica gel's surface is very clingy toward water. When moisture in the air comes in contact with it, it clings to the surface. Eventually, a sufficient quantity of water vapor gets ad-sorbed in the air in an enclosed space that it reduces the humidity. And a humid environment is not favorable to the growth of bacteria and mold.
Basically, they dry out by evaporation from contact with air. But certain things like paint form a film on the surface that inhibits the drying of the liquid underneath. Paint evaporation can happen, of course, if the can is left open long enough, but the materials used in such things are also made with care so that they remain liquid as long as the customer needs them. On a wall, it’s a different matter: much more surface and the drying happens much more quickly. Oh, and sometimes it is not exactly “drying” in the sense of the water being extracted from the liquid and leaving a solid. Sometimes there is a chemical reaction with the air (more precisely with the water vapour in the air) which makes it change from liquid to solid. There are a lot of glues that are based on this kind of reaction, superglue being an example. In this case, if the container is kept closed, the liquid will stay liquid.
I think you have a misunderstanding of the word 'acid'. An acid is not just a caustic substance that burns things. The word DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid and it is not a caustic substance that burns. An acid is a substance that donates hydrogen ions. Hyaluronic acid is called an acid because it is a big molecule and one of its parts is called a carboxyl group, also called carboxylic acid, a very weak acid. Hyaluronic acid is used as an injection to increase the thickness of the skin and to smooth wrinkles. Hyaluronic acid occurs naturally in our body and is an important lubricant that lubricates our joints and is in the gap between our cells, which is essential for the skin to heal and to keep it lubricated.
It’s a leftover from the old days when the only way to determine alcohol content was to test it with fire. As far as I know, proofing is still the standard way of testing alcohol content, but the laws regarding alcohol content in beverages date back to at least a hundred years ago (possibly older, thanks to Prohibition), and so alcohol labels are a bit outdated.
Did you seriously copy and paste your homework from the links?
Time is important with certain ingredients, particularly in quick-cooking and in high-heat cooking, because all the flavor components do not get released at once. Just think of making tea—if you steep it for just the right amount of time, it comes out with a pleasant, mild taste. But if you steep it too long, it will come out bitter.
– That depends on the substance. – You’re right. – 1 mL = 1 cubic centimeter = 1 gram.
The glass is inert as shit. Cans are lined with tin, which can be tasted especially when they contain something as acid as soda pop. Fountain drinks are usually made with tap water and taste like tap water.
The taste we recognize as salt is not produced by Na bonded to Cl; it comes almost entirely from Na + ions. Different sodium salts are available, and all of them seem to have a salty taste. Take dry salt. Put it on your tongue. It dissolves in the water on your tongue.
There are several methods of measuring at a distance. There are pyrometers, which are in reality only very durable thermometers... These can go up to three thousand degrees. There are infrared thermometers, which are nothing more than lenses that focus the rays of the heated object on a ‘thermopile’. These rays produce electricity, and it is then possible to convert this electricity into a usable temperature. There is also the method of black-body radiation. The speed of the molecules is different depending on the heat. The closer to absolute zero, the slower they go; the higher the temperature, the more they vibrate. This produces infrared radiation, which the eye cannot see. This is why a piece of red-hot metal has a glow, this is the phenomenon. This last method is the one used for measuring the temperature of stars, as it is possible to measure the luminosity and thus calculate to within a hair’s breadth how hot the star must be. This is why astronomers use the Kelvin scale, and why this starts at 273.15 degrees, because this is absolute zero, and you must start at the bottom... We can also tell from the way light interacts with the atmospheres what sort of atmospheres a planet has, and this gives a fairly good idea of the temperatures that must be found there... The radiation, the speed of the molecules is quite constant, and you can even test this on earth to some extent.
The ice that is white is air-locked and more mineral-laden; the ice that is transparent is pure water. I’m not sure what else I can say, but Reddit thinks that’s not enough. This is something that is very easy to look up on Google, so perhaps this question does not belong here. I hope this is enough.
Grapefruit juice affects many different medications. In a nutshell, when you take a pill and it dissolves in your stomach, some goes into the bloodstream, and some is metabolized by your liver. Scientists take this into account when they design pills and make them a certain size, knowing that only a certain amount of medication will get into the bloodstream (where most medications must go to be able to go around your body and do their work). But grapefruit juice has a certain compound that actually inhibits the liver’s metabolism, so more of the medication is absorbed into your bloodstream than what scientists and doctors had planned for or expected. This can be dangerous with some medications because you may get more than your recommended dosage, or it may speed up the absorption of other medications, so that they are absorbed more quickly rather than more slowly over time.
Fat. Cheese and meats contain a certain amount of fat that melts at high temperatures. Because fat boils at a lower temperature than the other solids in cheese and pepperoni, the fat separates and becomes greasy. It's one of the reasons cheese is usually not a good idea to heat in the microwave.
A similar thing happens with a thing made out of legos. It’s easier to break the object than it is to break a single lego. In the same way, the forces inside the atom are much more powerful than the forces that bind the atoms together.
If you look at the rough surface of a transparent material immersed in a medium of different density, the light is scattered in all directions, and the surface appears white. Let’s suppose you have a transparent, flat, smooth piece of glass. But if you break it up into little pieces and smash it with a hammer, the powder that remains will appear opaque and white, although it’s exactly the same glass — it’s just not smooth. Now, here are the densities of the different materials: air: 1.00 Window glass: 1.52 Water: 1.33 Ice: 1.31 So you can see that the densities are significantly different between air and ice. That’s why you can see the ice cubes. If the ice cubes weren’t carefully prepared, you would have seen an opaque surface. Now, put these ice cubes in water. Now, there are two things that happen: 1 — the difference between the densities is fifteen times smaller. This alone makes the ice cubes much less opaque. But if you look closely, you can see the surface of the ice, because even though the difference in density is smaller, it still exists. 2 — since water isn’t exactly at its freezing point, as it touches the ice, it takes some of the heat away from it. This causes a thin layer of ice to melt, which makes the surface smoother, which makes it more transparent. Now take some of the glass powder and put it in the water. You will see that the same glass powder is now less opaque — the difference between the densities is smaller.
Because they have been sterilized and sealed in an airtight container, canned goods cannot grow bacteria. Once opened, however, they lose their airtight seal and are no longer protected from contamination.
We can eat salt and drink water. But we cannot drink sea water, because it is too salty. The amount of salt matters.
There are several reasons. First of all, to ensure that the active substance reaches the point where it should be absorbed without being destroyed in the stomach or in the small intestine, it has to be surrounded by something that does not break down in the stomach. Secondly, it is very difficult to work with very small amounts of substances because any slightest error in handling produces a large error. It is therefore easier to dilute the substance and then use more of the diluted substance. Thirdly, many people have difficulty in seeing and picking up small objects. So a tablet has to be large enough that it can be handled by a person with poor eyesight and a slight lack of dexterity. Even the best medicine will do no good if it cannot be taken. Fourthly, marketing and the placebo effect: Everyone has an idea in his mind of what a medicine should look like and taste like. Medicine that does not fit into this idea is more difficult to sell and is often less effective than medicines that do. So pharmaceutical companies try to make everything look and taste familiar.
By sliding the lid over, the oil doesn't splash. If you splash it, you are putting a much larger surface of burning liquid in contact with oxygen in the air. Splashing is literally the worst thing you can do. By sliding the lid over, you are suffocating the fire. If it is safe to do so, it might also be possible to carry the pot outside, but that is also highly dangerous. You are carrying a pot full of flaming fuel. If it is safe to do so, suffocate the fire. The fire blanket is a wonderful invention. If you do frying at home, you should buy one. It's not very expensive. (Some lids do not suffocate the fire sufficiently, they let in too much air, and the fire doesn't go out properly.)
Lets suppose that your grandmother has a secret recipe for chocolate cake, but she won't tell you what's in it. If you're a good cook you can eat the cake and say, “I can taste the coffee in it, there's obviously some flour and eggs and cocoa and butter and a bit of cinnamon too” — but you can never be absolutely sure of what's in the cake. But by using your knowledge of cooking you can get something very, very similar to the cake your grandmother makes. You will never get it exactly right, because you don't know what exactly she uses, how much of each ingredient, in what order she puts them in, how long she bakes it and at what temperature. But you can get very close, because you know how to make cakes generally and you can guess the rest by the taste. But without knowing the full recipe you can never get it absolutely right. It's almost exactly the same with coke, the other cola companies can come up with something very close but they can never get it exactly right.
Because the body consists mostly of carbon and hydrogen, which are combusted with oxygen to form CO2 and water. Both of these are converted into gases, and rise up the chimney. What is left is what does not become gas and is thrown out.
- Firstly, it is not true that matter can not be destroyed, people are often mistaken, because energy is conserved. The atomic nucleus is capable of fission, that is, a nucleus (the father) splits into one or more lighter ones (the daughters). When a heavy nucleus splits into a lighter one, it gives off energy, the energy is connected to the mass, by E = mc2, and the mass of the daughter nuclei is slightly less than the original nucleus, and corresponds to this energy. So the atom bomb works in a chain reaction. The nucleus of uranium is hit by a neutron, and it splits, and energy, daughter nuclei, and three more new nuclei are formed. This nucleus splits and releases more and more and more and more, so on and so forth. In the atom bomb, the reaction is chaotic, and continues and speeds up, and then the reaction is broken by the ejected material and thus stops the chain reaction, but it blows up the bomb itself and everything in the surrounding area.
If you mean a wick lamp, you light it with a match or a lighter. The initial heat to evaporate the kerosene comes from the fire. Then, as the fire catches, the heat released by the fire heats the kerosene in the wick up to its flash point. It’s like that with any kind of fire started on purpose. It requires a heat source to start it going.
It is a fairly unstable molecule. Exposure to light causes it to break down into ordinary water. The brown bottle is simply for its opaqueness and so protects the contents from light.
And also, the expiration date is set somewhat haphazardly, and marks the end of a period of testing. The period of testing is usually selected to allow for the time required for manufacturing and distribution, and in the case of hand sanitizers, it probably also takes into account the average lifespan of a bottle in the home. It also takes into account that a bottle will be kept closed at room temperature. A hand sanitizer that has exceeded its expiration date is still considered effective, but the data do not support this claim.
Big companies mix good and bad together. This reduces the bad effect of a bad cow. The other products use brand flavors to make sure their brand taste is maintained. You may have noticed that the taste of orange juice is the same for all the brands, though the taste is different for each brand. Every brand has its own unique taste – it is a combination of certain ingredients like the peel of orange etc. which are added to the concentrated orange juice. The concentrate and the concentrate can be stored for long before they are mixed. This ensures that the brand taste is maintained throughout the year.
Yes and no. Yes, because just as the eye has only a few different types of cones and can “compose” different colors by the combinations of different cones activated by the colors, the nose has only a few types of olfactory cells that can combine and produce new scents. And the bad news is that, whereas the number of cones in the eye is three, we can only guess that the number of olfactory cells in the nose is “somewhere around 400.” For each of these 400 different olfactory cells, you would have to find a chemical that activates only that one type of cell and, as far as possible, does not activate the others. Since there is no guarantee that such chemicals actually exist, you might end up with more than 400 chemicals.
No. Part of the reason why we cook our food is that it makes the nutrients more easily absorbed and assimilated. There is no additional nutrients added, only changes in the food. Starches can become sugars, which are more easily absorbed by the body and hence give us more nutrients and energy. If we ate the starch-rich ingredients before cooking, we would not be able to digest and absorb as much. Similarly, cooking meat changes the nature of the meat, thereby making it easier to digest.
The burning of hydrogen fuel is due to the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen. This reaction produces water. The idea is a fuel that does not produce waste and burns without waste and that can be thrown directly on the ground without risk. My question is: what do we do with the oxygen?
If they can measure the result with a small amount of material, they won’t be wasting any material that could be used for other experiments. Also, when you don’t know what the result of the experiment will be, it’s best to minimize the possibility of the experiment suddenly going wrong and causing the equipment to break. Or, as they say, I like my eyebrows where they are.
It would not be inserted, but rather an element from the same column would be chosen, since elements in the same column have similar properties. The elements are arranged in numerical order, so there is no way to insert new ones. There are, however, hypothetical isotopes with unique properties.
That’s because when the food is cooked, it is rid of the bacteria living in it that cause it to spoil. Once it is cooked and cooled down, it becomes a home to other bacteria (unless it is sealed like a can) but the new ones have time to multiply and become dangerous.
It’s just filler. Excipients. Things to make it dissolve either fast or slow. Benign stuff to fill the space and make it bigger. Sometimes small pills are hard to swallow and might dissolve in your mouth when it was meant for your stomach or further down.
First of all, I’m not an English native speaker, so please forgive me if I’m not always grammatically correct. Oil is a (semi-)transparent liquid. When light strikes it, a small part of it is reflected, the rest goes straight through. Because oil doesn’t have the same depth or direction in all places, the amount of light reflected isn’t the same either. And that’s how the different colours are created. There are other factors, like interference of light waves, that also affect the colour we see, but I won’t get into that.
Amino acids and proteins could have formed on the primitive Earth. The Miller-Urey experiment proved that such primordial “soups” were possible, and provided a primordial source of life.
Dryness usually refers to the fermentation of almost all sugars into alcohol. But the dry sensation that is sometimes experienced in red wine is caused by the presence of a substance called tannin.
You're absolutely right; the vinegar and baking soda neutralize each other. The solution is written by people who haven't a clue about chemistry. They think the fizzing is cleaning action and don't understand that they're really just scrubbing with water (a perfectly acceptable solvent for a number of stains). Then the recipes get repeated on other blogs and from one columnist to the next, because they just copy from the other people.
The starch acts as abrasive to remove dirt, oil, soap scum and other stains that cannot be removed by water alone.
The cooling of the egg contracts the white and makes it firmer.
All the healthy vegetable oils are healthy because they contain unsaturated fats (the fat molecules don't have all the hydrogen atoms they could have). Saturated fats (usually animal fats) generally have more adverse effects on the cholesterin. To turn vegetable oils (liquid at room temperature) into margarine (solid at room temperature), you have to saturate the fats... add the missing hydrogens. This raises the melting point of the fat and makes it "harder", that's why lard or butter is solid at room temperature. It also makes the fat a lot more like unhealthy fats than the original vegetable oil was.
Since metal only rusts when it is exposed to oxygen, the answer is no. But it can degrade—though much more slowly—through radiation, which is a much greater danger in space where there is no atmosphere to protect against it.
Both are fit for human external use. Shower gels are generally more aggressively cleansing than shampoos, while the latter generally contain more “conditioning” ingredients like silicons to seal the hair cuticle, but they are both safe and will not cause any health problems. The only consequence might be a little dryness or a little more tangling of the hair.
Soap is very easy to understand. You know that oil and water don't mix. So soap molecules have a hydrophobic (that is, averse to water) and a hydrophilic side (that likes water). So the fat molecules stick to the soap from one side and the water from the other and they wash away. And that's pretty much it.
It was cheese. It was then altered to give it certain desirable properties, such as the ability to ooze from a tin and to melt at a lower temperature.
Instant ramen is parboiled first, then fried so it’s crunchy like potato chips, and all you need to do is make it soft. But with pasta you have to make it soft by cooking it so that the starch soaks up water and makes it into pasta. Science answer: Pasta is a water-soluble sponge. Cold pasta is crunchy and won’t expand even when wet, but when it gets hot, it spreads out and soaks up water like a sponge and turns into pasta. But simply heating it won’t do it, it’ll just burn, not expand, because life is so hard. In instant ramen the sponges are already expanded, they’re just dry right now, but with pasta they still have to soak up water, so they have to get hot for a while in water before they can soak up anything. It’s true, as someone mentioned in the comments, that you can get it to expand by letting it soak in water for a while, but it takes forever, and you can’t get it to taste good unless you heat it up so the starch is activated. But it’s also why you can cook pasta in a very short time, and also why you can cook fresh pasta much faster than dried.
the calories increase per gram, because you take away the water, which is not a calorie but adds weight.
They do not degrade. Q: do they run out of electrons? A: No, because for each escaping from a solar panel, another will be entering it at the opposite end of the circuit. No, the solar cells never run out of electricity. But yes, they do degrade. And this happens as a result of oxidation.
It’s sort of true that they get the exact amount of drug by adding a larger amount to the mixture, but the mixture is mixed thoroughly and they’ve developed a method for mixing the mixture that’s almost perfect, so that each pill contains exactly the same amount of drug.
That depends a lot on the kind of medicine you want to make and how much risk you want to take. Think of it in terms of illegal drug laboratories, which are basically doing the same thing. In fact, some public recipes for prescription medicines you can make at home start from illegal drugs as a starting point.
The microbiome of the human body competes for nutrients with external microbes. Most people reading this have MRSA on them, but your natural skin fauna is so prevalent on the skin that MRSA has a hard time getting there. When you use antimicrobial wash, you wipe your skin mostly clean and the fauna has to recolonize itself. During this time the MRSA can get the upper hand. It's a small chance, but the more often you do it, the more likely it is to happen.
Vinegar is 4-8% acetic acid and the rest is water. Vinegar is a fermentation product and the result of a double fermentation. The first fermentation is when yeast converts sugars and starches in the aqueous solution of potatoes, fruits, grapes, cereals, etc., into alcohol. The second fermentation is when bacteria convert the alcohol into acetic acid. A bottle of wine can be reverted to vinegar and become red or white vinegar. This is true of apple cider vinegar as well. The apples leave more than water behind, which is why the color and flavor are different from regular vinegar.
The smoke is acid, and the meat becomes saturated with acid. You don’t notice it very much when you have a mouthful of it, since the saliva mixes and dilutes the acid. But the bacteria and the mould do not have the same luxury and cannot survive in acid conditions. Smoking does not in itself preserve meat, however, and the process dries the meat and also improves its preservation. You must store it in a dry and preferably cool place in order to preserve it sufficiently. It is also common to salt the meat.
I think it’s because the solids are settled at the bottom and the liquids rise to the top. That’s why it needs to be shaken up before you use it.
the sub-rules require that you search first. Water hydrogen or water flammable will bring up many duplicates of this question.
The surface area is much too unequal for almost any substance to form a meaningful joint, and because of the unequal surfaces, you trap a lot of air between the surfaces. It happens, but so few atoms are involved that you really don't notice. But if you had two flat surfaces in a vacuum, they would join together.
Asbestos is a very stringy, very fibered mineral that is dug up. Think of a pit in the ground where they take the glass. It was cheap, fireproof and fairly strong. It was very useful to make it harder and thicker in places where there was a lot of tile, instead of paying for fiber glass as they do now. It was also used a lot in clothing, to make them fireproof and heat-resistant. Like glass fibers, it was also used in many thermal blankets, because you could make it fluffy and it prevented the heat from passing. But it also crumbles into very fine fibers that you breathe in, and they stick to the lungs and cause a special cancer in the lining of the lungs and chest, mesothelioma. In 80% of cases, mesothelioma is caused by exposure to Asbestos. It is very much in the line, and that is why it is so important that *If you or a loved one suffer from mesothelioma, you may be entitled to compensation...
Important to note, the brain produces its own natural cannabinoids, these are called endocannabinoids. Their function is to regulate the balance between the stimulatory and inhibiting nervous impulses. Here's a simple analogy: On the old TV's, the color wheel has a "saturation" scale where you can change the relative strength of red, green, and blue. Endocannabinoids are the color wheel of the brain. To be more specific, they regulate the level of GABA (inhibitory) and glutamate (stimulatory). When you use the Phyto-cannabinoids (the plant-based cannabinoids), you change the balance. You move the sliders. This can have a positive or negative effect. It depends on many factors. For example, cannabidiol is a cannabinoid that changes the balance towards more inhibition. That's good for epilepsy. Epilepsy is caused by too much stimulation. The more inhibition the better. A derivative of cannabidiol, Epidiolex, is even prescribed for some forms of epilepsy. THC is a cannabinoid that changes the balance towards more stimulation. That's bad for Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is caused by hyperactivity of the dopaminergic system, resulting in psychosis. It is a well-known phenomenon that cannabis can cause psychosis and possibly even schizophrenia. The high-THC varieties are the most dangerous. But, cannabidiol seems to reduce the risk of psychosis.
It... It... That's why it has a whistle, so you know when it's boiling.
A painkiller binds to a site on the brain that prevents the brain from translating the pain signals from the body into the subjective sensation of pain. The painkiller does not know where to kill the pain, but rather turns off the brain’s ability to recognize pain in the whole body.
To be simple, no. Even if we had synthesized all the chemical compounds of an apple, then we would still have to arrange them in a real apple. The cells and processes in apples are so incredibly complex that it is almost impossible to recreate them.
acidity is the state of having a low pH, the amount of hydrogen ions, and the opposite of basicity. Various things are acidic, but not poisonous, lemons, for example. Toxic substances are generally neutral or acidic substances, but which are dangerous to people or animals.
You shoot out the pressurized CO2, it combines with water to form carbonic acid, but the reaction is reversible, so it slowly escapes as bubbles. The rate of escape is limited, so not all of the CO2 comes out at once in one big bubble. The only way to increase the rate of escape is to add more bubbles and nucleation sites. One way to do this is to introduce many little bubbles like the surface of a Mentos.
we can, and we do. When hydrogen is burned, water is its by-product. But the problem is to find a convenient source of hydrogen. On the whole, the need to manufacture water is minimal, given the natural abundance of it.
Both salmonella and e. coli are intestinal bacteria, which can spread if the intestines are ruptured during slaughter. In beef, a good sear on the outside will kill the bacteria, and that's all you need. For chicken, it requires higher heat, or a longer time at lower heat. Trichina was the great fear in pork, and higher temperatures were recommended to kill it; but this idea is so old that it may no longer hold up. The problem is largely a matter of cultural norms and outdated laws. Here's an article with some history:
no, they stay bound, but the molecules of water separate from each other. When they cool and come together, they form liquid water.
I can explain it to a five-year-old, because I have one of those kids who’s on drugs and I’ve already had to explain it to her. This is the gist of it: picture a classroom. 20 kids and one teacher. The teacher is fast asleep at her desk. The kids notice and take advantage of the situation by running amok. They start running around, getting high on the lack of authority. How do you solve this problem? By waking up the teacher. The teacher wakes up and is able to calm the kids down, and bring them back to their assigned work. Stimulants wake up the teacher, the executive function. The kids, the casual, stray thoughts and diversions that we all have all the time, cannot be excited any more than they already are. To bring them back to order, you wake up the teacher. This is what current treatments do, but they do it over a long period of time. If you phrase it right, a five-year-old will understand this analogy. Every child knows what happens when the teacher leaves the room for a second. Edit: I’m glad that my oversimplified answer to this question was helpful to some people. It’s how I explained it to my daughter when she started her medication. By the way, for those of you who have been unconsciously self-medicating with caffeine your whole lives, this is why you can’t think straight until you’ve had your morning coffee. I’ve self-medicated with caffeine all my life without realizing it. I’m no expert, but I’ve learned a thing or two. It’s a multi-faceted diagnosis. It’s not a single test or a single person. Teachers are, generally speaking, not allowed to say that a child has an attention disorder. My daughter’s second grade teacher was trying to imply something, but we already knew by the time she was four or five that there was something wrong. When we told the teacher that we’d be taking her to a specialist, she said thank God, because she couldn’t legally say anything to us because she’s not a medical professional. So don’t expect the teacher to tell you anything. You need at least two or three opinions to come to a decision, not just one. How do you know if your child has an attention disorder? Go to the school play, the Christmas show. All the kids are lined up onstage and they’re singing for the parents who are packed into the rest of the auditorium. Your child is over in the corner, rolling around on the floor, singing along, but not paying any attention. Her teachers tell you that she spends the whole class period crawling around under desks, making forts, but when they ask her a question, she will have heard the whole thing and answer the question with a casual air, as if making forts is an everyday thing. I could go on and on, but I don’t want to start preaching. But, basically, you know.
You can only see color when light strikes an object. Some of the wavelengths of light (which are what we call colors) are absorbed by the object, and the others are reflected to the eyes. A lemon looks yellow because the wavelengths of yellow reach your eyes. When a piece of fabric gets wet, a layer of water lies on top of it. Suppose you splash water on your cool-green T-shirt. The water layer reflects some of the green light back into the fabric, so there’s less of it to reach your eyes. Less light reaching your eyes = darker appearance.
They eventually dry out, just like any other kind of rubber. A tyre out in the weather wears out (slowly), rubber gloves dry out after a while, and so on.
The foil has low heat capacity and is not particularly thick, and high heat conductivity, i.e. heat can pass through and out of it easily. It heats up quickly, and can be hot enough to burn you, but it loses the heat very quickly.
The sun’s heat warms the layer of air above the road, making it less dense, and the light in that layer refracts, making the road appear to be lighter in color. The glossy effect is because the hot air rises and is replaced by cooler air, which then rises and is heated by the road, resulting in a moving cycle that changes the degree of refraction, thus creating a dazzling effect. The refraction is not complete, however, and to see light from the sky one must have a low viewing angle. Upon getting closer, the angle increases and even though the refraction is complete, the light that strikes your eyes comes from the road, not the sky, and so it loses its bright, wet appearance.
If this is at all similar to the HPA axis, it is because there is a very small amount of the substance circulating in the body at any time. Most of it is produced in the brain and is used up quite short distance "downstream" of there, which is virtually equal to a negligible level in the general circulation. If you were to take a blood sample from a person's arm, as we usually do, you would hardly detect the substance, let alone determine if there is an imbalance. It would be necessary to draw blood inside the brain, between the two points where the substance is produced and reabsorbed, to be able to conclude anything at all. By the way, depression and ADHD are usually associated with a neurotransmitter. It's a molecule that you find in the brain and which lets one neuron communicate with another neuron, but is hardly found in the blood. So again, you would have to take a sample of the connection between two neuronal cells to measure the amount of neurotransmitter. It is easier to study the effect of drugs that act on neurotransmitters. If you give SSRIs (Serotonin re-uptake inhibitions) then you will make the Serotonin stay longer before it is reabsorbed and then it is properly transported from neuron to neuron. Normal people will not react the same as depressed people who have, so to speak, a Serotonin deficiency. Contrast this with ADHD meds. Normal people on Adderall get high, while people with ADHD on Adderall can calm down.
We can't. Radiocarbon dating only works on organic materials because it depends on the existence of a time when the material in question had taken up carbon from the air, which usually means that it was living. But suppose we find the remains of an arrow shaft in the same place as the stone arrowhead. We can then date the wood, which would give us the age of the tree it came from, not the age of the arrowhead, but it's close enough.
I find this statement a little subjective. Good Marijuana is a much more enduring experience, and can just as easily permeate several rooms in a house.
“Safe” is relative. The pharmacological dictum says that everything is poisonous in excess. Even water can cause poisoning. But the problem with these drugs is the very aspect of addiction. Perhaps, one can use a little heroin and come out unscathed, but it’s an addiction and it will keep you coming back for more, wreck your life but not kill you, or you will take more and kill yourself. For example, in the United States, Fentanyl is prescribed for pain. I don’t see why heroin can’t be, except that Fentanyl and morphine already occupy that niche better.
Intermolecular forces (the strength of the force that keeps the molecules together) determine these temperatures. Lowering the pressure will increase or decrease these temperatures.
The air can do it. Every kind of fuel burns at a different temperature and gives off a different amount of energy. If the burning fuel gives off so little energy that the fire is not able to maintain its temperature, the burning fuel goes out. Some liquid propellants, for instance, can’t burn at room temperature, they need to be at very high temperatures and pressures to burn. Diesel oil is also very difficult, though not impossible, to burn at atmospheric pressure. If the air is not good enough to keep a fire burning, it is not good enough to start one.
What determines the color of the meat is the amount of myoglobin in the tissue. Myoglobin is a kind of blood that transports oxygen within the muscles of animals, especially the cow, which is very red when exposed to the air. People eat a wider variety of muscles on birds - they eat both those with a lot of myoglobin (brown) and those with little myoglobin (white). But pigs are much less active than cows, and most of their muscles contain myoglobin that is slightly higher than the white meat of birds, but much less than the dark meat of birds or cattle. All of the pork sold in the shop is preserved with carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in myoglobin and creates a very bright red color. Even a tissue that has little myoglobin in it is very red when exposed to carbon monoxide before it is cooked, because myoglobin, bound to carbon monoxide, is a very powerful pigment. When the meat is cooked, the carbon monoxide is replaced by oxygen, and the tissue regains its natural color, which in the case of pork is very pale pink. Also chickens are preserved with carbon monoxide, and when they are cooked, they usually turn from bright pink to white.
Yes. That's the whole idea of the metric system, to remove ambiguities like that. Every SI unit you see is the same everywhere.
It’s not the same amount. The wax is burning up and turning into water, carbon dioxide and trace elements.
Fruit sugar is the same, but fruit contains fiber. Fiber slows down the digestion of sugar and prevents a sugar rush and crash. This is why juice is not as good as people think. Even though the sugar is natural, there is no fiber.
One theory is that hallucinations, hearing voices, delusions and other types of phantasms are related to the brain producing too much dopamine, and that certain antipsychotics block this production. But really there isn't much known about psychosis or the medicines used to treat it. My psychiatrists have told me that.
Serotonin plays a role in your mood, but it isn't a "happiness" hormone and depression isn't a "transmitter deficit" disorder. A simple increase in the amount of serotonin in the synapse won't necessarily make you happy or sad. But an overdose of an antidepressant that boosts this amount can cause severe side effects. This doesn't necessarily mean sadness. And in a serious overdose, it's not necessarily the most common. You can experience depression, mania, and even die from a high fever. (To clarify further, it isn't easy to get serotonin from outside the body into the brain. An injection of serotonin, for example, wouldn't reach the brain.) Most of the serotonin in the body is in the intestines. It is an important signal involved in blood circulation, especially in vein constriction. When an antidepressant increases the amount of serotonin, the happiness does not necessarily increase in proportion. This effect requires a long period of time to take effect. There are many contradictory theories as to why. An overdose of an antidepressant that affects serotonin clearance in the synapse can cause serotonin sensitivity. In mild cases, the symptoms are usually slight seizures. This is an increase in the rate of fever, the convulsions of the muscles, tremors, and strong reflexes. This is usually caused by an overdose of more than one serotonin-sensitive drug. It is a combination of a high dose of serotonin-reuptake inhibiting drugs and a high dose of a serotonin reuptake inhibiting drug. And a low dose of a reuptake blocking drug. For example, serotonin reuptake and metabolism inhibiting drugs, such as MAOIs and SRIs. Among the side effects, sadness and anxiety are among the most common.
This is a repost. The best answer is probably the original here:
This is basically the question asked in ELI5: Chemistry. The difference in the way elements behave is due to the fact that a fixed number of protons means that a neutral element has a fixed number of electrons. Since the electrons are arranged in a very complicated way in different energy levels, the interaction between them, as they seek the lowest energy state, is also very complicated. The full answer to the question requires a combination of quantum mechanics, special and general relativity, and very complicated calculations.
Because the fizz you get from the machine isn’t quite the same as the fizz you get from the bottle. The restaurants buy the liter syrup in jars, which the machines then mix with water and instantly with carbon dioxide, as soon as the handle is pulled. This means that the carbon dioxide isn’t so well dissolved. It’s less fizzy from the machine than from the bottle.
-- Let me answer with an example. Imagine that a deep valley runs between two mountains. You are at sea level on both sides of the mountains, but between them it is -2100 m, like in Death Valley. This is a metaphor for the stability of a molecule: the higher you are above sea level, the less stable, the deeper below sea level, the more stable. When the parts of the molecules are on both sides of the mountains, they are pretty happy, sea level is a pretty stable place. Since the mountains are quite high, they will never jump over them by themselves. But if you give them energy, they will jump over the mountains and come together in the valley between them, which is very deep and where the pieces of the molecules are very happy to stay. That energy input is the endothermic part of chemistry, and the valley between the mountains is the new, very happy molecule.
Yeast is a living organism (fungus), and sugar is its food. It consumes the sugar, and as a by-product it expels CO2 and alcohol. This is not a very thorough explanation, but I think you're over-thinking things unless you want a simplified graphic of the exact biological processes.
[Nikola] We use oxygen in our body when we oxidize sugar molecules and use the energy released. The carbon molecules are turned into CO2 (which the body doesn't need and are exhaled) and hydrogen into water.
A Base is the chemical opposite of an Acid, with a PH value higher than 7. Acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors (it’s the same for electrons). So they create bonds and chemical reactions. A base’s properties depend a little on the type of base and the concentration of the base in a solution. All bases react with acids and neutralize them, and like acids, strong bases are very corrosive and dangerous when they are in a high concentration, especially if they attack lipids (fats, oils and cell membranes) in the body. Some even produce heat. That’s why bases are used in household products. For example, bleach is a base.
The ingredients aren't mixed in the first place. Most drinks stay mixed on their own, unless they have pulp or coffee grounds or something that sinks to the bottom of the bottle. If you mix milk in your coffee, it won't ever have a milk layer on top. If you don't mix it well enough, though, you'll probably get some extra sugar or grounds at the bottom. You should do better.
If you throw a proton into a large nucleus with enough force, it has a small chance of being turned into an antiproton.
The light is caused by a chemical reaction when the two liquids mix. Cooling down the glowstick slows down and even stops the reaction.
Corrosion is an electrochemical process. The potential difference between a given metal and water is greater than between water and steel. The zinc corrodes because it is the more favourable reaction (the greater the potential difference the greater the “electrical energy” and hence the more favourable the reaction). The size of the metal is not important because the whole boat, zinc and hull, is a single circuit, and a big battery. So long as you have zinc in contact with the water and bolted to the hull of the boat, your hull is reasonably safe.
Tastes are just a combination of chemicals that react with your taste buds and your brain interprets as taste. These chemicals can be manufactured in a factory, like any other chemical substance.
The stuffiness of a blocked nose is often thought to be caused by mucus. But that’s not so. The reason you feel stuffy, even when you blow your nose, is because the inside of your nose is inflamed and swollen. The swelling blocks the air-ways so that you can’t breathe (or at least you find it very difficult to do so). The only way to reduce the swelling is by giving it a good scrubbing. During exercise your body uses a lot of blood for your muscles, so your nose is starved of blood. But the less blood that gets to your nose, the less swelling. Another way is to ‘trick’ your body into thinking that it’s doing some exercise. Some vapour rubs contain a chemical that’s similar to the one the body uses to stimulate action, which is called an ‘adrenaline agonist’. When you apply this to your nose, the blood-vessels in the nasal passages contract, reducing the swelling and enabling you to breathe more easily. Menthol doesn’t seem to have this effect, at least according to my limited research. (See e.g. Springer article.) People think that menthol helps them breathe more easily, but objective measurements of the air-flow in the nose suggest just the opposite – that it actually makes breathing more difficult. So why do people think it works? Menthol does have a slightly soothing effect, so it might be less painful to breathe through your stuffy, inflamed nose (unless you apply too much of it, in which case it can irritate the skin). And the coolness of menthol (it really does activate cold-receptors in the body) could make you feel as though you were breathing more easily, although in fact you were not. (You feel more air passing through your nose, because you’re breathing more easily, and fresh air is always a little cool – and the air you breathe is usually cooler than the air you breathe, since you’re usually cooler than the air you breathe.)
The polish only becomes hard on contact with the air. Inside the bottle there isn't enough air or enough contact with the polish to get the polish to harden.
Because the body will automatically cool down if it is hot and warm up if it is cold, and the body will eventually come to the temperature of the air around it (or of the water around it, if it is in water). Therefore, the hot drink is hotter than the air, and therefore loses its heat to the air. The cold drink is colder than the air, and therefore takes up some of the heat of the air.
An emulsion is a mixture of two liquids that do not mix or dissolve (immiscible), which have been mechanically stirred together so that, although they are not perfectly homogeneous, they are still fairly homogeneous. The best known example of this is water and oil. Oil floats on top of water and stirring does not change it. Stirring and shaking, however, combine to form droplets of the two liquids which are at times randomly mixed.
Incinerators are not uncommon. Some are even used to make energy. The trouble is with the second part of your question. You can never know exactly what you are burning and some materials will release dangerous substances. And then, to make matters worse, there are so many different noxious substances that they need to be filtered out in so many different ways. That is possible, of course, but not easy or cheap. So, even in the best case, you will still be letting out cancer-causing and other dangerous chemicals (including greenhouse gases).
1 mole of molecules is the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12. It is also the number of atoms in 1 gram of hydrogen. But carbon-12 is used as a standard because it has 6 protons, 6 neutrons and 6 electrons and therefore is the best substance for calculating the average weight of a proton, a neutron and an electron.
the energy expended to digest the food is not counted, only the energy in the food itself.
Yes, that's exactly what happens. Have you ever put your hand next to a hot drink and felt the heat coming from it? “Heat is lost” means that heat flows from the hottest to the less hot. The heat from your cup escapes to the environment, the heat from the environment escapes to the cooler environment, and so on, and so on, until the heat is distributed evenly.
A good question. And there is nothing more individual than an antidepressant. You may not get any of the side effects ever. Or it may start in the first week. Or in the fifth month. I stopped Zoloft on the third day because of dizziness. Wellbutrin has been a lot better. A few sleepless nights, but a fairly good mood.
They don’t. The only exception I can think of is a car battery where the fluid in the cells evaporates over time and reduces the weight accordingly.
Gasoline can also be a vapor at a higher temperature or it can freeze and be a solid at a lower temperature. Gasoline is similar to water.
: Damn, I hope there is no spark, or your lungs will go the way of the Hindenburg. But to answer your question, no, it's pseudo-science. If it were the best and safest way to "eliminate inflammation," it would be used everywhere. As for the best treatment for all diseases... you know, huh?
Tin foil also reflects the heat back in. Because it’s so thin, it can’t absorb much heat, and so it doesn’t radiate as much as it retains.
A CANDU reactor usually has a digitally controlled region controller which adjusts the density of the heavy water moderator in selected regions of the core to maintain a steady state. The control rods are also used for controlling the overall power and for regulating the overall temperature of the core. This is done infrequently and is less efficient. The LWRs do not require any such digitally controlled system. The flow of steam or cooling water can be adjusted according to the design of the plant.
A loaded question. Did you ever publish your manifesto? Or are you still waiting to see how people will react to it?
An area of probability in which one may find a single electron in orbit around a nucleus. In other words, the cloud represents where we think the electrons are.
They don't give you those things. They may increase the risk, but that risk is small and their benefits are great. Taking one pill will not give you those things, just as one teaspoon of sugar won't give you diabetes. But long-term use of painkillers may increase your risk of these (the same is true for diabetes and sugar, both of which are sold by the grocery stores).
This has to do with the way the water molecules line up when they freeze. The Veritasium channel made a pretty good explainer about this just recently:
In principle, this is possible, but an engineering nightmare, because these fuels are a wild mixture of different chemicals. For a fuel cell to work properly, you either have to build a terribly complicated machine, or you have to process the fuels into single-molecule type. Also, the molecules are much more complex, which means even more complications. (Even the simplest hydrocarbon, methane, is more complex than the very simple H2).
Several radioactive elements are not too dangerous if you don't get them inside you, especially not the dust. The radiation itself may not go far: for example, alpha radiation can be stopped by thick paper, and beta radiation by a thick woolen sweater. They are not dangerous in a lead glass jar behind a piece of plexi. Even elements that are more dangerous with the radiation are not dangerous in small pieces. Uranium would be dangerous if you had to stand next to a large piece, but a small piece behind glass is not so dangerous, as long as you do not sleep next to it every night. Uranium is dangerous not because it is so radioactive, but because it remains radioactive for a long time. Of course, there are a few elements that are very dangerous in small pieces. And there are a few that do not live long enough to be worth it before they decay. Those you will not find in a permanent collection. They may be in a museum, but you don't buy it. For example, Francium is dangerously radioactive and has a half-life of only 22 minutes. It's probably still worth buying it, but in a few days your sample will be mostly gone. And it is violently soluble in water, and if you don't store it carefully, it can explode.
Caffeine does not give you energy, not even a little bit. What it does is make you not notice that you’re tired. You’re still tired and your body suffers all the disadvantages of tiredness, but you can’t notice it. Moreover, if you drink too much caffeine too often your body gets used to it so that you don’t notice the usual amount of tiredness unless you’ve had caffeine. If you don’t, for example when you get up in the morning, you won’t be able to rouse yourself without caffeine.
As far as I know, there are only two instances when the consumption of alcohol is medically necessary—as in truly medicinally—beneficial. In both cases, however, only in small doses. First, when an alcoholic attempts to withdraw from alcohol, he can die, literally die from lack of alcohol. Secondly, the ingestion of methyl alcohol is fatal, but not the methyl alcohol itself but the compound which the body breaks down into, which is deadly. If one drinks alcohol, ordinary alcohol that is, the body will digest the alcohol and pass the methyl alcohol harmlessly.
The bend line is formed by tiny cracks and cracks. Light travels through the different sections of the material and air in the sections and gets scattered and appears white. Similar to frosted glass, i.e. glass with very tiny scratches, and water droplets in clouds.
Despite what some people may have said, defining the surface area of something like activated charcoal does, in fact, involve a phenomenon that is precisely analogous to the problem of the coastline paradox. You measure the surface area of a porous surface by effectively covering it with molecules of known dimensions. The number of molecules required to cover it tells you how much surface you have. The size of the molecules determines how small the corners and nooks can be that they can fill. That is, if you are using a large molecule to measure a surface with a large number of very small nooks and crannies, then you will understate the surface area. There are materials that have a surface area of several thousand square meters per gram of material. This is much greater than you could ever get by simply adding up the surface area of spheres covering it.
There are little rotors inside the pump nozzle, which the liquid soap strikes on the way out of the dispenser!
Oil, coal, natural gas, and most other ground-based hydrocarbons are the decomposed remains of sea life (or forests) that existed millions of years ago and died before fungus had developed to digest them. The soil and water at that time contained a lot of sulphur and phosphorus from the atmosphere, which is what those living things ate, and so end up in the coal, oil, or gas. When the extraction process starts, the gases naturally release and if there's water around they react with it and produce hydrogen sulphide, sulphur dioxide, and sulphuric acid, which really smells bad. When they drill down into an oil well, they naturally drill through a relatively dense pocket of these gases, which is why there's that "jet of oil" effect in the movies (because the pocket of oil is literally pressurized) and like any other liquid locked up with pressurized gas, some of that gas is going to stay in the liquid, (think of a two-liter bottle of coke, and the gas coming out is natural gas, hydrogen sulphide, etc.) Most offshore oil rigs have a big flare stack, where they can vent any gases that come out of the well. There's no way to treat them out in the open sea, and releasing them as CO2 is a lot less harmful to the environment than releasing methane. There are a few states that allow this kind of thing, like in California.
Because they're polar molecules. The molecule is curved and has unequally distributed electrons. Although the molecule is neutral in its overall charge, there are small positive and small negative areas within the molecule.
The sunlight refracted into a rainbow is still visible light, only its wavelengths are scattered slightly in different directions. None of the visible wavelengths is any more dangerous than all the visible wavelengths combined in white light.
, A large part of the burning sensation is caused by the hydration of the water in the skin itself. So in order to avoid further injury, it is best to stop all burning sensations quickly—both chemical and thermal. Now, if you were to drop water on the sulphuric acid on your skin, you could make the heat burns worse. But if you can spray the area with a high ratio of water to acid, you’ll probably have a net benefit. Water has a high capacity to absorb heat.
the salt does not melt the ice. It lowers the freezing point of water. Technically, if the temperature is lowered sufficiently, salt water freezes.
The stickyness clings to the tape. At first. Later it clings to something else, to paper, to the wall, to the humidity in the air, to dust.
Ultraviolet light can damage the DNA of a cell, which destroys its functionality and eventually kills the cell. It also produces some ozone, which is extremely harmful to cells. It is used for cleaning because it is a very gentle method of disinfecting objects, and does not require toxic or dangerous chemicals.
Alcohol is poisonous. The liver is designed to change poisonous alcohol into harmless acetic acid. This acetic acid can even be converted into harmless carbon dioxide, thus releasing useful energy — which is why alcohol has calories. Unfortunately, there is a hiccup in the process. Alcohol cannot be converted directly into acetic acid; first it must be converted into something called acetaldehyde, which is far more poisonous than alcohol. The steps that your body goes through after drinking alcohol depend on the ratio of alcohol to acetaldehyde in the blood. When you drink, you have lots of alcohol in the blood and not much acetaldehyde, so you go through the alcohol phase and experience the effects of alcohol, such as not being able to think properly. On the other hand, during a hangover, the alcohol is now largely acetaldehyde, so your brain is no longer inhibited by alcohol and so you have a combination of acetaldehyde poisoning, the effects of dehydration, sleep deprivation, and a host of other individual annoyances which occur at the same time.
When you cut an onion, a gas is released that, on contact with the water in your eye, forms an acid that burns.
What you see is the sum of all the colour pigments in the liquid. Coffee is a dark brown, almost black. Milk is white. Add some milk and the two pigments combine to make a new colour, one that is a lighter brown than the dark brown.
But when the electricity passes through water, it’s not the water that becomes dangerous—it’s the electricity. Our bodies use the differences in electrical charge between cells to conduct nerve signals, and electricity is a huge source of electrical charge. So when electricity passes through a person’s body, it causes all sorts of electrical signals to fire at once. The muscles contract, the senses get thrown off balance, etc. This can be extremely dangerous to the functions that need to be controlled constantly, like the heart. And that’s not all: when electricity passes through anything, it encounters resistance, which causes heat to build up. Eventually, enough electricity passing through the body creates enough heat to cook the tissue and damage it by denaturing the protein molecules and chemically altering the cells forever. Electricity can burn through a human being’s body like a torch—which is why electricity is normally so dangerous. But how come it’s so dangerous when it’s in water? Water conducts electricity. Well, technically it needs a certain amount of dissolved salts or other ions, but since the water isn’t normally very distilled, it can be considered a good conductor of electricity if you want to be picky. So now, instead of a dangerous wire, you’ve got a dangerous fluid that covers a much larger area and can spread out in unexpected ways. And of course you don’t know whether it’s safe or not because it looks like harmless water, but the electricity that passes through you is on its way to the ground through you. And yes, if you disconnect the electricity, the water becomes harmless at once (as long as it’s not too hot). Think about it: if you disconnect the electricity from a wire, the wire is immediately safe to touch because it hasn’t become a dangerous material.
When we say "touch," we usually mean 'bump into'. Even though they don't touch, they can interact, and if this interaction is a high one, we say "sticky." Touching is bad. It's called fusion.
The simplest answer is that cookie dough is a collection of biochemicals (sugars and sugar polymers, proteins, fats, etc.), and if you kept heating it up, those big molecules would start dissolving into smaller molecules, until the chemical composition was changed so much that it no longer qualified as cookie dough. High enough temperatures will melt just about everything except lumps of carbon, which do not melt at any temperature at normal atmospheric pressure. You can’t melt cookie dough, because it would cease to be cookie dough before you reached the melting point of its components.
Its value lies in its energy density. You can set fire to it and get lots of energy, but to get energy-dense molecules, you need to input energy into the system. First by the plankton that dies and produces carbon-dense sediment, then over millions of years by geological conditions that impose high temperatures and pressures on the sediments for a long time. If you want to do this artificially, you need to input that energy, and you have to put in more energy than you'll get out. So it's an inefficient process.
Many dishwashers dry the dishes by heating up a coiled wire in the dishwasher. This wire can get so hot that it can warp certain plastics or damage the enamel on cups and dishes. Usually this coiled wire is placed on the bottom of the dishwasher, so the top rack gets less heat. This is why certain dishes are “top rack only.”
The bubbles you see on the surface of boiling water are not air. They’re only water that has become hot enough to turn into steam.
Gas (in this case CO2) dissolved in a liquid. The better the gas is dissolved, the more it will be able to disperse. If the gas is dispersed, it forms bubbles and floats to the surface. If a drink is shaken up, the CO2 forms bubbles and floats to the surface. It is not unusual for winemakers to use a de-gassing machine (something like a drill-mounted paint shaker) to remove the CO2 from the wine between fermentation and bottling.
No. But when you look into it more closely, you'll find there are some very small deviations due to two phenomena. * The binding energy of nucleons. * E = mc2 According to E = mc2, whatever loses energy loses mass. If the nucleus of sodium is a bit more stable (in other words, more strongly bound), the nucleus will lose less energy and therefore less mass. Likewise, if the nucleus is a bit more unstable (lower binding energy) than carbon's (the standard) it will lose more energy and therefore more mass. Hence it is lighter than 23. * The natural distribution of isotopes. * Sodium may be most abundant in the form of 23 AMU, but there may also be some 22 or 23 AMU (that's, with one or two more or less of the usual number of neutrons) and less abundant in the form of 21 AMU. That would affect the precise figure, because you'd have to take an average of them. In reality, sodium's nucleus is a bit more stable than carbon's (as a rule, stability increases from H to Fe and decreases from there onwards). Moreover, sodium is a monoisotopic element, that is, it has only one relevant isotope on earth. So the second phenomenon is disregarded for sodium, and its AMU would be a little less than 23. It's 22.98976928 (source)
It all depends on how it's ice! If you put a tray of water in the chiller, the cold first touches the outside water. That's what freezes first. When the water gets colder, it can hold less air; a few of the air in the water will be released into bubbles. And when the ice is frozen from the outside in, these bubbles are stuck in the ice, so it's cloudy. Now, an ice-maker usually uses a cold finger that lets the ice freeze from the inside out, so if there are bubbles in the water, they are carried away by the water jet and the ice remains clear. That's why the restaurant ice gets those holes. Edit: After further research, I learned that although the above still applies, the other main role is played by the impurities, minerals and such, in the water. The ice freezes as crystals, the crystals try to push the impurities out. Freezing from the outside in, the impurities are pushed in and piled up in the middle. Freezing from the inside out, they escape with the water that flows out.
When you eat, you digest it in your stomach. But the small molecules still have to go through the cells of your stomach to get into your bloodstream. The molecules need to fit through certain channels to do this. If they don’t fit, they don’t get absorbed. Some zero-calorie sweeteners are similar enough to sugar to taste sweet, but too different to fit through the channels. Other zero-calorie sweeteners are so good at stimulating your taste buds that a tiny, tiny amount tastes as sweet as a lot of real sugar. But there’s so little of it in your food or drink that it’s pretty much like you’re not eating any calories at all.
Your entire body is constantly working to keep its internal balance, and it’s more complicated than just getting rid of the bad and keeping the good. You can compare it to a puzzle, and you’re not allowed to leave empty spaces in the puzzle. If you’re trying to get rid of sodium, you have to replace it with something else similar enough to the sodium to go there. For example, if you want to get rid of some sodium, you have to try to fit something else into the space that would have been occupied by the sodium. While water may help with the symptoms of dehydration and cramps, it doesn’t provide the pieces necessary to fill the space where the sodium was. Those will still have to be taken from elsewhere. Therefore, a large excess of sodium places a severe strain on the body. The high level of sodium can cause the loss of certain nutrients that are no longer absorbed because there’s no room, it can strain the kidneys, which have to get rid of large quantities of the mineral on a daily basis when they don’t have enough pieces to get rid of it, and it can end up causing even more imbalances as other pieces are shuffled to keep everything in balance. The body also holds on to water to prevent those immediate problems caused by the sodium—dehydration and cramps. But that doesn’t fix the underlying problem. (TLDR — High levels of sodium are like playing a game of Tetris with lots of one piece and almost none of the others.) You may try to adjust, but eventually you’ll end up with more and more pieces that are nothing but sodium, and you’ll have to get rid of them. Water doesn’t give you the pieces necessary to deal with a puzzle full of sodium, and it even clutters up the board more by attaching itself to the sodium.
White gold is alloyed with white metals such as nickel, while yellow gold is alloyed with yellow metals such as copper.
For fire to exist, three things are needed: heat, fuel, and oxygen. There’s no random fuel in the air, and heat quickly falls off as you get farther from the flame. Oxygen, though, is the most abundant thing in the air. Luckily, the other two, fortunately, aren’t.
Covalent bonds occur when atoms share a pair of shared electrons. The two atoms stick together because they are grabbing the same shared electrons. Ionic bonds are no sharing. They just take the electrons from each other. That means one atom is negatively charged and the other is positively charged. They are kept together by the electrostatic force that attracts negative charge to positive charge, as if the two ions were just a big proton and a big electron. Molecular compounds are basically small compounds in which individual molecules are isolated from each other and are not physically linked to each other. This is different from a macromolecule or macrostructure, which is like one big molecule with no boundaries, because everything is stuck together. For example, silica, the main ingredient in quartz, has the formula SiO2, but quartz is not a bunch of individual SiO2 molecules huddled together. It's like a big mesh of Si and O atoms. Each Si atom is linked to four O atoms, and each O atom to two Si atoms, and each of those Si atoms to four O atoms, and each of those O atoms to two Si atoms, and each of those Si atoms to four O atoms, and so on, and so on, and so on. So the formula does not mean that there are separate SiO2 molecules, but that there are twice as many O atoms as Si. O2, for example, is molecular. O2 does not form large circles where each oxygen atom is linked to two other oxygen atoms. In this case you do have individual O2 molecules. Generally, ionic compounds are macromolecular.
If water is heated to 100°C, it does not get any hotter. @@@ Adding energy to it only makes it evaporate, not heat up. But the boiling point of oil is much higher. Adding energy to it will make it heat up. When you see bubbles in the oil, most of them are the water evaporating from the food.
(epI1) Radiation consists essentially of alpha, beta, and gamma rays. A positron is something different, and belongs to particle physics. That is to say, it is a helium atom devoid of an electron, an electric ray (like light, but more dangerous), or simply a radioactive ray.
Better results. Some things, like bread, can become chewy when they’re cooked in a microwave, but other things can dry out too much in an oven, making them too dry and hard. Both ways are good, and it depends on what you’re cooking.
The first discovery of metals is not recorded in history, because it occurred in prehistoric times. Probably someone had thrown some metal-rich rock into the fire, and then the typical "manly" camp-fire was made, with more heat than necessary. The next morning, the ores were found to have melted and the ash was pure copper.
unny dust is what you get when cooking oil vapors get blown out from open saucepans, and then lands on nearby surfaces, where it mixes with dust.
A vast quantity of water must be frozen. This requires an enormous amount of energy, making it incredibly expensive. The problem is not a technical one but an economic one. Many of the areas threatened with loss of freshwater do not have the means to build a large-scale desalination plant.
It is true that vitamins and other nutrients are lost during cooking. But it depends on the cooking method and even after cooking a lot of vitamins and nutrients remain that your body needs for good health, assuming you have a balanced diet. Some cooking methods even help you to absorb nutrients better. Meat and other fatty foods, however, may lose some of their nutrients during cooking, but it all depends on the method of cooking. Anyway, we cook meat because it is generally not safe to eat it raw.
I don’t understand the question. But in the end, it doesn’t make much difference. Hot water has a high energy, cold water has a low energy. When you mix them, they will divide the difference. Cold water heats up, warm water cools down, and then the energy is divided equally. It is not possible that half the water heats up faster than the other half cools down. This would go against the first law of thermodynamics.
Millions and billions are spent on developing drugs. Most drugs when they come to the market are patented and only the company that owns the patent can manufacture and sell it until the patent expires. This is the reason why we have generic drugs, the generics are made after the expiration of the patent. The cost of developing the drug is passed on to the consumers in the price of the drug during the time it is under patent. For example, I used to take a medication that was not available in generic form and if I didn’t have insurance it would have cost me $9,000 a month. I went to a pharmacy that sold generics and they were available for only $145 a month (without insurance).
Water can evaporate below boiling point. The molecules of water are different speeds; the very fastest can escape even at a temperature below boiling. This happens with everything wet; when you wipe yourself with a towel and leave it hanging for a while, it will get dry. The reason you see the steam is that the air is very cold and therefore not able to hold a lot of steam. Consequently, the water molecules that have left your wet clothes will immediately re-condense into tiny liquid droplets in the air. These tiny droplets are what you see as steam.
Pure potassium being a very reactive element would like to violently bond with another element. That’s what makes it dangerous, but the potassium in bananas is part of a molecule, meaning it has already bonded with something else. That’s why it’s harmless. Also the chlorine in salt doesn’t kill you because it’s bound to something else. The potassium in bananas does make them slightly radioactive, but you should still eat them. You get ten times more radiation from a conventional tube TV than from a banana. It’s perfectly safe. As bananas are measurable in radioactivity, physicists often joke about BEDs, the banana equivalent of a body dose. That means how many bananas would you have to eat to get the same amount of radiation as from a chest X-ray? It would take about 10,000 bananas to equal one BED.
Depending on the reaction, a catalyst is sometimes consumed as an intermediate product. Suppose there are three reactions between A, B, and C: 1) A + B = AB, 2) A + C = AC, and 3) AC + B = AB + C. It is easy to see that, when the three elements are mixed, the reaction is: A + B + C = AC + B = AB + C. C has been the catalyst.
* A *lot *of *different *chemicals *are used – I can’t give you a list of them all. This is a list of strawberry flavourings, for example:
A sensor that looks for sulphur in the air can probably detect bad breath. Sulphur (S) is the foul smell of morning breath, onions and farts. There are breath sensors out there that react to certain chemicals in the exhaled breath. Odor is not a quality of food, but a sense. If you can smell something, the gas particles go up the nose and are captured by the olfactory sensors in the nose. The bad breath sensors could probably find the chemicals that the bacteria in the mouth excrete, which are responsible for the odor (which people consider bad).
Opioids fit into the opiate-receptor sites in the brain like a key in a lock. Naloxone closes the lock. It is more technical than that, but that’s the gist of it.
Sunscreen works by blocking and absorbing UV rays, using a combination of physical and chemical particles. Physical particles like zinc or titanium are used to deflect the UV rays from the skin.
The color of flames depends on two things: the composition of the fuel and the temperature of the flame. Wood is the commonest fuel, and since it burns at a relatively low temperature, its flame is orange and yellow. A higher temperature produces a lighter flame. Add other fuels to a flame, and the color changes to red, green, blue, etc.
H2 lacks an electron, acidity is the concentration of H+, i.e., hydrogen atoms deprived of their electron, a single nucleus, a proton and a neutral. There’s nothing that the proton and the neutral want more than an extra electron, so they snatch one with force. And in the process the “donor” loses an electron, becomes an ion, and dissolves.
Alchemy is the medieval name for chemistry, based on the alleged transmutation of matter, and was primarily occupied with attempts to transmute base metals into gold, or to find a universal panacea. Part of it was humbug, but the greater part was chemistry.
The toaster takes the moisture out of the bread. It also burns the sugar in the bread, which gives the bread a brown color. This reaction is called the Maillard reaction, which gives the surface of grilled or fried meat a brownish black color, but inside the meat is still lighter.
Yes, because pressure cookers work by putting the food under pressure. That increases the boiling point of water, allowing more heat to be applied to the food and, therefore, cooking it faster. Certain chemical reactions—which is what cooking is—don't occur at lower temperatures, or at least not as quickly. This could result in different textures or tastes when cooking at higher temperatures. You can offset some of these by managing the cooking time better, but they will still occur. In most cases, the time savings from using a pressure cooker outweigh any downsides.
All you really need is a small amount of fluoride to strengthen the enamel, and the rest is just a mild abrasive to help you clean the deposits. Everything else is marketing. In terms of toothpaste, it’s really up to personal taste. Brushing and rinsing are enough to keep your mouth healthy. Two things I would recommend: an ultrasonic electric toothbrush, which seems to work better than regular hand brushing. A tongue scraper, just a cheap, simple plastic one, is also effective in cleaning off the deposits on your tongue and freshening your breath.
so that they are all incorporated. You don’t want a piece of the cake to have all the baking powder, or salt, or sugar. They have to be incorporated, so that they also participate in the chemical reaction that the mixture is about to undergo.
They used to do laboratory tests to find out. Then they’d burn it to see how many calories it had. Nowadays they just calculate how many nutrients were in the individual ingredients (which had already been tested in a laboratory and averaged), and they add them up.
“The bubbles are hiding in the liquid, and they come out when everyone has gone. The carbon dioxide is dissolved in the liquid. Under higher pressure, the liquid can hold more dissolved substances, and when the pressure is relieved when opening the bottle or can, the dissolved carbon dioxide is converted into a gas and forms bubbles.
Carbon is very good at absorbing things. So it's really good at sticking stuff to its surface, such as poisons. Charcoal is mostly carbon. That's why it's black. It's also very porous, so it's very light and easy to crush. So it has lots of surface area. Ten charcoal tablets have a combined surface area of the whole of a soccer field. And the more surface there is, the more you can absorb. Note that charcoal is only *mostly* carbon. And there's a big difference between'mostly carbon' and 'all carbon'. Ordinary charcoal, the kind that you get when you burn wood, contains tar and all sorts of other nasty things. And the worst thing is that the surface and, especially, the pores of the normal charcoal are almost completely blocked by these nasty things. So most of the surface of the charcoal is completely useless. It can't be used to soak up anything. It's true that charcoal can soak up a lot (it's good enough, for example, to purify mash before final distillation), but it could soak up a lot more if you took away all the tar. This tar-removing procedure is called 'activating' the charcoal. The end result is a charcoal that's not only carbon, but 'pure' carbon. All its pores are clear and can absorb stuff. UPDATE: Got a few questions in ITT, so I'll answer them here. a) Adsorb is a real word. It means the same as 'absorb', but the poison sticks to the surface of the adsorbent instead of being absorbed into the inside of the absorbent. There's no real practical difference between the two words, unless you're a chemist. But I like to use 'proper' words for chemical things. And that includes using the right word, even when the wrong one would do. b) Toxins are poisons that are made inside living organisms. Botulin and penicillin are toxins. Mercurous chloride is not. Whether methylmercury is a toxin or not is a matter of opinion. There is no chemical property that makes something toxic. Capsaicin is not toxic to us, but to some insects it's a deadly neurotoxin. Yes, I'm aware that 'toxin' is just a word that's used by companies and people to sell useless stuff to people who don't know any better. No, I'm not going to stop using the word. It's a good word, and it means exactly what I think it means. I don't give a damn what anyone else does with it, or why. c) The category I called 'things like toxins' would be better called 'poisons, drugs and vitamins'. Charcoal doesn't care, it just takes up whatever it finds. d) It's called 'activated' rather than 'pure' because 'pure' would require a separate 'ELI5' explanation to *every customer*, because *everyone* (except a small number of chemists) would wonder why it was better than ordinary charcoal. In the days before the Internet, this would have been a very expensive process. But nowadays, anyone with a connection to the Internet can find out how activated charcoal works for themselves. UPDATE2: I've already answered another frequently-asked question about how charcoal is activated, here. That's not an *exact* answer, but there are some good YouTube videos about the whole process, and there's one here: Now I see that I should probably have just linked to this from the start. It explains it all very clearly, and shows the difference between ordinary charcoal and activated charcoal using a iodine test. UPDATE3: There seems to be some large-scale quackery that I'm not aware of. People seem to be getting angry enough to ignore points b) and c) above, and yell at me about things that I've already made clear about ten times already. So I'll restate them, more strongly. e) Whatever the quacks or 'health gurus' may say, activated charcoal DOES NOT HAVE ANY MAGICAL PROPERTIES. The only things it can do is soak up poisons that are already in your stomach. For example, if you've eaten some mouldy food, activated charcoal will soak up the poisonous stuff in the mould. But it will also soak up everything else that isn't water, a short-chain alcohol or an inorganic salt. This includes vitamins and nutrients. So using it as a supplement is a bad idea. You probably don't get enough vitamins as it is, so don't reduce the small amount you already get by drinking adsorbents when you don't need to. In other words, if you drink activated charcoal, you'll probably poop out most of the poisons in your stomach without absorbing any of them. The only reason I said 'things like toxins' is that that's what Russian doctors use it for: absorbing poisons from food. Not inorganic heavy metals, for example, because charcoal is not very good at soaking them up. There are other things that are better at that. They only use activated charcoal in an emergency, like when someone's eaten something bad or drunk too much of some other drug. But, like anyone with even a basic knowledge of chemistry, they know that charcoal just soaks up everything. So, now that I've made my opinion clear, I would like to ask you all to stop telling me that activated charcoal has no magical properties. I know that already.
The blood-brain barrier is a second line of defense between everything that circulates in your blood and your brain because the brain is really important and your body needs to protect it to keep you alive. The barrier is made to keep out dangerous molecules, and that includes drugs, too. Meds that can’t cross the blood brain barrier often have little or no effect on the brain because they can’t reach it. But some meds can still have a strong effect even if they don’t hit brain cells and histamines. Older antihistamines like Benadryl affect the histamines in the brain, which can make you sleepy and foggy-brained. Newer antihistamines like Claritin don’t affect the histamines in the brain at all and don’t make you sleepy or foggy. Because they don’t cross the barrier as easily, they don’t have the same effect.
Vinegar is a natural, edible acid, as lemon juice is. It is dissolved in water and other liquids, which gives it flavor and makes it useful for cooking. Unlike lemon juice, vinegar is produced by the fermentation of yeast. Like lemon juice, vinegar is also useful as a cleaner. Because vinegar is unfavorable for most germs, it can be used as a preservative, but it will affect the taste of the preserved food.
Sugar in general is very stable under the conditions of the surroundings, and does not decompose, or only after a very long time (as long as years or decades) if the bottle is closed. If the bottle is open, the sugar will eventually be eaten away by bacteria and fungi. To answer your question, No, it will not decompose on its own. Sugar-free beverages do not contain sugar at all, but are sweetened with other sweeteners. If you want to get the sugar out of a purchased product (for whatever reason you may do this), I can think of only one way of doing it: the use of the right kind of enzymes. The sugar is broken down into smaller molecules, which no longer taste sweet and which do not have the high energy content that sugar has. However, it would be necessary to remove the enzymes again afterwards by settling and filtration. It should be noted that the action of the enzymes is confined to a certain temperature and a certain pH value. It will therefore take some experimentation to find the right kind of enzymes (preferably commercially available) for the product you want to get rid of the sugar in.
How do you know it's not placebo? Have you had someone do a double-blind test on you?
No, and I usually mean skin irritants. Assuming that your gear is glass, use rubbing alcohol and salt and rinse with water.
Coffee is a stimulant. It makes your entire body work: your digestive system: have a seat; your nervous system: have a seizure; your emotional system: have a smile.
All the ones I know of use Lidocaine, which is a numbing agent and a local anesthetic. It does nothing but stop the pain signals at the nerve ends, it does not address the cause of the pain.
stability is relative. Nature is all for achieving the lowest possible energy state. The lowest possible energy state is O2 rather than isolated oxygen atoms. So, as long as you have oxygen gas, it is stable as O2. However, if copper is in the vicinity, oxygen will react with it and give off energy. The energy is now stored in the copper-oxygen compound rather than in the oxygen or copper atoms, and therefore the new compound is the lower energy state.
All water has a little dissolved gas. I’m quite sure that when water freezes, and expands by virtue of the arrangement of its molecules, this gas is expelled from solution and forms the bubbles.
but that reason is historical. As you know, there are several numbers which give the position of an electron, or the shell it belongs to. One of these numbers is the angular momentum, l, and it is this number that is of interest to us. At the beginning of spectroscopy, it was noticed that some series of spectral lines of alkali metals, those corresponding to the angular momentum values l = 0, l = 1, l = 2, l = 3 were sharp, principia, diffuse and fundamentally related to hydrogen lines, in that order.
It doesn’t exist. No truth serum. There are a lot of substances that can make you lose your inhibitions and talk (like alcohol), but there is nothing that would induce the same consistent or predictable increase in truthfulness.
Because the process is very different between the restaurant and the bottling company. The bottling company's process is mainly used for large-scale production, and it is often used to produce tens of thousands of liters of tea. The tea shop may only be able to produce 10 to 50 liters of tea. This process is very different, so the tea is naturally different.
The hand sanitizer is mostly alcohol, so it's inflammable like vodka. An electric spark can ignite inflammable things.
Big Tobacco actually paid for scenes like that to be put in movies to make smoking seem cool so they could sell more cigarettes. Thank You For Smoking is a great movie that covers a lot of this.
does the humidity of the air collect around the bottle? Yes. The bottle is much cooler than the air and the passing air, reaching the dew point, drops the water on its surface.
Concentration of stress. Picture a sheet of paper, you hold both ends evenly and pull it apart. Not hard enough to tear it, but it’s under tension. Hold it in front of you and pull it left and right. Let’s look at the middle of the paper, on a line going through the center, and this line is right between your hands as you pull the paper to the sides. On that line, at any point on the paper, the tension is about one pound per square inch. That’s not enough to tear it, but it’s a lot. Now imagine you snipped a small slit from the edge of the paper—a cut at the end of that line. Still didn’t tear. But what is happening to the paper at the slit? It’s being pulled apart, so obviously it’s no longer carrying that one pound per square inch. But the stress it would have experienced is transferred to the paper right where the cut ends. The more elastic our material, the more evenly this stress is spread out. Paper has little elasticity, so it’s highly concentrated right at the end of the cut, much more than that initial one pound per square inch. And so it’s easy to see why the paper tears right where the tension is highest. And the tearing continues, dragging that point of highest stress with it.
When you stick the tape to something, that thing is dirty and the dirt adheres to the tape, reducing the amount of tape there is left to stick to the next thing. The tape on the outside of the roll is clean, so there is nothing to stick to the sticky part.
Glass manufacturers put iron into their glass to make it easier to work with. When you look at glass from the front, the glass is so thin that the iron is hardly noticeable. But if you look at it from the side, the thickness is about ten times greater and so the iron stands out.
When someone starts a long-term drug, it usually takes a while to achieve what is called the therapeutic level, which is what you are talking about. You take 50 mg once a day, but your liver releases only 5 mg, and after 24 hours only 2,5 remain, and you need to have at least 35 to work, so you will not notice anything for a week.
They do not cause physical damage, but chemically affect certain vital functions. For example, nerve impulses use only small amounts of certain chemicals as a signal. There are countless numbers of them, but atoms and molecules are incredibly small. It takes huge numbers of them to make something large enough for us to see and interact with. For this I have to use the concept of the mole. It is based on Avagadro’s Number which is 6.022 x 1023, or 602,200,000,000,000,000. A mole of substance is the number of atoms or molecules in a certain quantity. So a mole of iron is a lump of iron that has 602,200,000,000,000,000,000 atoms. A mole of water is a drop that has 602,200,000,000,000,000,000 molecules. Fentanyl has a molar mass of 336.471 grams per mole. That means there are about 0.003 moles in a gram. So a gram of fentanyl has approximately 1,806 quintillion molecules. Not fentanyl in particular, but just suppose there is a chemical that attaches to the nerves and blocks the signal. If you take a mere 0.0003 grams of it, you’d have enough to block the action of 1,806 quintillion nerves in your body. That’s assuming that every molecule would go to a nerve and bind with it, which is highly unlikely. Just using numbers to illustrate the concept.
It is a sugary fluid spun out. The idea is to melt the sugar enough so that it flows through a small tube, coagulates and becomes a thin, flexible cord. To do this, a candy-maker rotates a heated cup with small holes on the outside, which are connected to the bottom of the cup. When the sugar melts, it passes through the holes, crosses the air and cools down, and collects on the outer rim of the cup.
Soap doesn’t need to be bubbly or foamy. Companies add bubbles because they think they make their products work better. Among the ingredients used to make soap bubble are sodium laureth sulfate (SLS), sodium lauryl sulfate (sometimes called sodium lauryl dodecyl sulfate, or SDS), and coco-glucoside.
This is only for the second shell; atoms have more than two shells. Each shell may contain up to 2n2 electrons, where n is the number of the shell. Hence a third shell may contain up to 18 and so on. The reason for this maximum is quantum mechanics. It seems that the quantum numbers describing a single atom only allow for four numbers, and when there are more than that number in a shell, two of the four numbers must be used to describe two different atoms, which is not possible.
Yes. A temperature is the average temperature of a collection of particles. In that eight-ounce cup of 40° Fahrenheit water, there are molecules which are 41°, 42°, and even lower. But the average is 40°. When the two eight-ounce cups are put together you get sixteen ounces at an average temperature of 60°. If the hot water were to take over and make the combined 16 ounces boil to 80°, that would violate the second law of thermodynamics. And where did the extra heat come from? If no heat enters the system, the total amount of heat must remain the same.
This phenomenon is called contrailing. When a plane flies at high altitude, water droplets that escape from the engine's exhaust mix with particulates from the engine exhaust and freeze when they meet the air. The crystals of this ice freeze into a long white streak. If you search on the Internet, you will no doubt find the conspiracy theories of chemtrails, that the aircraft drop chemtrails into the air to poison people, to keep the population in check, or what. That is nonsense.
Because it has fermented or spoiled in some way. Or it’s just some peculiar chemistry that only happens when left out for a long time.
That we don't know. There is a common working hypothesis that depression is caused by an imbalance of substances in the brain (neurotransmitters like dopamine, etc.) and that antidepressants help correct this imbalance. But a lot of evidence is against this - we have not renounced this hypothesis because our other explanations are even more inapplicable. A nobel prize is definitely waiting for the one who will solve it. But although we do not know how it works, we still use it because it helps many people. We only do not know why it helps some and not the other.
Alcohol and water combine; that is, alcohol actually dissolves in the water and forms covalent bonds with it. This solution has a much lower freezing point than pure water, and is really a new homogeneous solution.
No. It's good to think of chemicals as objects in the real world. Now imagine that you have two balls. You have tied them together with a rope. But between the balls there is a spring which is compressed and tries to pull them apart. The spring can't separate them because they're tied together, but it tries as hard as it can. Now imagine that an exothermic reaction cuts the rope. Then the spring can push them apart really hard and they can go in opposite directions. Now you have two balls moving and bumping into things. If you know what heat is, you will remember that it is the movement of small particles. So if our two balls are now small particles and they are moving around, we have just produced heat. I saw you asking about the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy in another post. It's analogous to the spring. While the balls are tied together, there is a lot of potential energy stored in the spring, and that energy cannot be released. But once you've provided the energy to break the bonds (cut the rope), the spring can push them apart and that is the same as converting the stored energy into kinetic energy. * *ATP is different, though. It is very important to release as little heat as possible, since heat will escape and you will lose the energy. Essentially, we use the energy of the cell's chemical reaction (the expansion of the spring) to shoot the ball (ATP) into a second spring. The second spring is compressed by the incoming ball, which makes the two balls stick together, just as the first balls were held together by the rope. The important thing is that since we used a hook to hold the balls together instead of a knot, we can get the balls apart again when we want to. That is essentially what ATP does. It compresses a spring system which is very easy to unlock when you want to release the energy.
Fireman speaking. Fire needs three things to exist. 1. Fuel 2. Oxygen 3. Heat. If you remove 1, fire can’t exist. Take a candle. Cover it. Oxygen is exhausted, candle goes out. This is why fireman don’t fight fire with fire. They fight fire with fuel. Stop giving it fuel, it will burn out by itself. Now for the common house fire. It’s too big to cut off the oxygen. It’s too big to knock the building down and remove the fuel. So the only way is to remove the heat. Water is excellent at removing heat. It’s also very cheap and readily available. Fire doesn’t really consume things as we think. Every material has a heat of ignitability. The heat of ignitability is the temperature at which the material gives off combustible vapours. These vapours are the ones that burn. These vapours are hot, the same temperature as the heat of ignitability. When you light a fire, it takes about a minute to reach the heat of ignitability. The flame from the lighter heats and dries out the material. When the material reaches this temperature, the vapours are ignited. This produces a chain reaction. That’s what smoke is. It’s just fuel that hasn’t burned. When smoke gets hot enough, it will burn. Water is thrown on the fire. Water is colder than the burning vapours. It cools the vapours and vaporizes. When the burning vapours are cooled below the heat of ignitability, the heat is removed. There’s no heat, fire goes out. Water is very cheap. It’s also infinitely available. It’s used for all sorts of things in the city. It’s so easy to get hold of, you just have to chuck another pipe into the water supply, put a cap on it, and you’ve got a fire hydrant. Using water in such quantities is also good for the environment. There are materials more effective than water at removing heat, but they’re usually expensive and not always practical. They might also require special equipment. Water can easily be directed into a hose and a nozzle. Foams and powders are great at putting out fires, but it’s not as easy and you can’t use them in such quantities. Water can react with the chemical on fire and start the reaction again. That’s why you have fire extinguishers of different types. To summarize: Water is good at removing heat, and plentiful and cheap enough to be used everywhere to put out fires by removing the heat. (NB. There are a lot of comments on this particular article.) Yes, this is the current theory on how fires behave. This is slightly above the ELI5 level, so I’ve kept it simple. The fire triangle is very easy to understand, explain and demonstrate. The chain reaction isn’t.
The reason is that you've opened the container. Get two jugs, one for a gallon, one for a pint, and they'll both be pretty much the same as long as you don't open them. The reason you open them is because it's opened to the air and the air carries bacteria. Milk is pasteurized in the factory to kill the bacteria and make it last longer.
The white part is at the bottom, near the outlet, and the two colors are mixed together right before they come out. If you cut it in half, it would be one color at the top and the other at the bottom.
Because distilling concentrates the alcohols in the final product. All fermentations produce a mixture of methanol (the bad alcohol) and ethyl alcohol (the good alcohol). In general, the amount of methanol in products of fermentation is small and is therefore not dangerous (wine and beer). Methanol also boils at a lower temperature than ethyl alcohol. Thus, in the first distillation, the initial distillate contains a high (and dangerous) concentration of methanol. This must be discarded to remove most of the methanol.
salt contains many additives to prevent caking. Sodium silicoaluminate is an anti-caking agent, it prevents salt from clumping... Dextrose apparently stabilizes iodine.
- Polonium was dissolved in the tea, he was also poisoned, but he suffered most of all, because he was the only one who drank tea. The poisoning from polonium does not go through the skin very much, because the particles are too heavy to get inside, but once they are inside, they tear everything apart. In general, the dust got everywhere, as dust usually does, and this is how they tracked down the poisoning.
Working for a large manufacturer in the quality department, I can assure you that the nutritional values on the packages are pretty accurate. However, there is a 20 percent tolerance of the real value. There are many different ways to test for fats, fats, vitamins, minerals, and so on. These values usually remain the same for each ingredient and are compiled in a large database that is easily accessible when it is necessary to determine the nutritional value for new products. The only things that contribute to the caloric value are fats, fats, and carbohydrates, which give nine, four, and four calories per gram, respectively, and then add up to the total caloric value in the product.
Sunlight evaporates only the water, leaving the salt behind. This is how water is distilled: by evaporating and distilling it and collecting the water and salt that remains behind.
Well, the salt is broken up into molecules smaller than the pores of the filter, so it passes through. If you had a filter with pores smaller than the molecule of salt, then the solution would not pass through.
The key difference between these three is the amount of fat. Butter has a very high fat content, about 80%, cream is somewhere between 30 and 50% (depending on the type) and milk a meager 3.5 (or less) percent. These fat contents in turn affect the consistency of the ganache and, in particular, whether it will be thick or thin and liquid. The traditional ganache recipe calls for 50-50 chocolate and cream, a nice silky texture with plenty of fat from the cream. Some people prefer a lower fat content and therefore use cream and milk together, resulting in a slightly less rich and less viscous texture. If you use milk exclusively, you may have to use less of it or use other tricks to prevent the ganache from being too thin. But a bit of butter added to milk will give it the same richness and silkiness as the cream. If you run out of cream or can’t find heavy cream, then a little melted butter will be a good substitute, allowing you to create a glossy and smooth texture. All of this is a matter of balancing the fat in the ganache with the fat in the chocolate.
Your body’s chemical reactions are fixed. It is impossible to introduce new chemical reactions. All medicines are either stimulants or suppressors of the chemical reactions. The side-effects occur because the medicines are chemically similar to the ones that they are supposed to suppress or to stimulate. And all these chemical reactions are interconnected. Whenever one reaction is suppressed or arouse, a domino effect begins, causing other reactions. Moreover, as the same chemicals play different roles in different parts of the body, administering the analogue of those chemicals may also have many different effects on different parts of the body. Here is a chart of the chemical reactions in your body.
A steroid is a molecule with 17 carbon atoms arranged in four rings. But by that definition, cholesterol is also a steroid (or a sterol). Steroid hormones are substances that activate specific nucleic acid receptors, such as the sexual hormones, such as testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone, which act on their specific respective nucleic acid receptors, and the corticosteroids, including mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. If you're taking a medicine that suppresses your immune system, it's a glucocorticoid. [45] Anabolic-androgenic steroids, which increase muscle mass, act on the same nucleic acid receptor as the sexual hormones.
It isn’t hard. All you need is either lots of time and space (for natural evaporation) or huge amounts of energy (for distillation) and a comparatively low yield.
Well, our body uses many, many other enzymes to process things, but you just don't hear so much about them. Our metabolism consists essentially of burning what we eat, and a whole arsenal of enzymes makes this happen at temperatures that don't kill us (by being catalysts of the reaction). The B12 vitamin is actually transformed into two other enzymes, Adenosylcobalamine and Methylcobalamine, but its purpose is not to be broken down in large quantities for energy, but rather to be a part of the breakdown process.
Glass is made of two elements, silicon and oxygen. To dissolve glass you’d need to split these two apart, and they’re as inseparable as a husband and wife. The relationship is very solid. But then along comes the home-wrecker, the acid, with its attractive ions, and these couples are attracted to the ions more than to their husband or wife. Hence they dissolve. The marriage of silicon and oxygen in glass is too strong for most acids to break. Except hydrofluoric acid. That’s the mansplainer of the acids. It’s hot. Edit: After much thought... I’m leaving the typos. Thanks for all the awards! I wasn’t expecting them!
When food is reheated, it draws moisture out of it. This is why it’s usually no big deal with very greasy or wet foods—they’re just going to end up a little more soggy than before because they’re losing the moisture and probably acquiring more from condensing inside the refrigerator.
It is not so. All that happens is a chemical reaction. There is nothing added to the battery when it is charged.
I've always been told that warm water raises the temperature of the meat to unhealthy temperatures for too long, while the inside remains frozen. Cold water will not heat the meat so quickly, but will still defrost it, without it being exposed to a range of temperatures at which bacteria multiply rapidly, etc. When you thaw meat with water, you do not want to cook the meat. Cold water is not really that cold. Cold water is cold, but not that cold, otherwise it would be ice. Have you ever come in from the cold and stuck your hand in the cold water, but thought it was warm water, because it was warmer than your hand? That's it. I'm not a food scientist, that's just what my grandmother taught me.
But secret recipes are rare unless they involve some ingredient that is not and cannot be produced by anyone else on the planet, otherwise everything can be reverse-engineered and deduced. But with that, you also run into questions like why should you spend so much time and energy trying to figure out the content of a food? And you will probably receive a cease and desist order if you are encroaching on someone else's intellectual property.
The brain has specific receptors for the drugs, which they bind to like a lock and key. The puzzle piece of Narcan also fits this lock and key, and so it binds to the receptors instead of the drugs.
This is a matter of understanding that we do not produce electricity like in our electrical generating stations, and that in our bodies there are no conductive wires carrying free mobile charges. In the body, ions are used, that is, charged atoms. There are many common substances which can act as ion sources, such as sugar. Salt, for example, breaks up into positive and negative ions when dissolved in water. Then special structures, the so-called ion pumps, can move one kind of ion through the membrane and leave the other. There are therefore a large number of positive ions on one side of the membrane and a large number of negative ions on the other side, and we have a difference of potentials (volts) between these two sides. Let the ions meet, the potential drops, we have an electric pulse, then the ion pumps can restore the potential. It is thus by the creation and collapse of ionic potentials that man and most animals use electric signals.
The “RI” in both of these stands for “reuptake inhibitor.” When two nerve endings transmit a signal, they both release serotonin and norepinephrine, which are picked up by the little hairs on the receiving nerve ending. This doesn’t happen immediately; first, the signal has to be picked up. And then, after the signal is gone, the serotonin and norepinephrine are taken back into the nerve cells and stored again. Sometimes, however, in people with depression, the signal isn’t passed on properly because there aren’t enough serotonin or norepinephrine in the space between the nerves, so the signal isn’t passed on well. SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, but SNRIs inhibit both serotonin and norepinephrine. So more serotonin or norepinephrine can accumulate in the space between the nerves, giving the signal more time to be passed on. This is how a psychiatrist once explained it to me a few years ago. But please don’t take what I’ve said as medical fact, and leave the real doctors to do their own research.
Because until the solvents have evaporated, the paint will be partially liquid and can easily be smudged, removed, or even washed away.
There are other substances that evaporate with water, making it difficult to separate them out. The wasting of water comes from wasting clean drinking water. It is difficult, expensive and not energy-efficient to clean water for human consumption. Once water is mixed with other substances or goes down the drain, it is no longer clean drinking water. It cannot be used for growing food, for animals, or for anything else.
I do not think it would do much good. There are plenty of water-purifiers which make use of charcoal to a certain extent, but generally the water passes through a large number of small grains of charcoal so that all the water can come in contact with it. Charcoal works by being exceedingly porous and rocky. Those minute particles of dirt which come in contact with its surface are absorbed and removed from the water. It is thus necessary that all the water come in contact with the charcoal’s surface. So it can be an effective means of removing many impurities from water, but stirring the water with a stick of charcoal would probably be the least effective way. I should think it would be better to grind the charcoal, place it in a coffee-sieve, and pour the water slowly through it.
Metallic hydrogen, which is a superconductor, would mean less fuel would be needed for a rocket and so more weight could be put into it. The metallic hydrogen would give a greater power-to-weight ratio.
Now the brain works with messages transmitted by neurotransmitters, and these neurotransmitters activate the so-called “receptors,” which in turn transmit the message (like a letter in a mailbox). We have receptors for all the neurotransmitters that our bodies produce. These messages via neurotransmitters and receptors are important for the functioning of the body. And the body likes normal functioning. When you take drugs, you activate these same receptors in a way that is exaggerated, really the peaks are so exaggerated, and the body does not like this, because it is not normal functioning. So our body is like: "Well, we need to make some changes to get back to normal. " Normally, you get this by removing the drug. But the body, when the drug is repeated, thinks: "Wow, removing the drug doesn't help, then we have to get rid of some of the receptors to get back to normal functioning." Then you get a letter in each of the five mailboxes every day, you think that's plenty. And then suddenly you get fifty letters in each box every day and you can hardly do anything because you get so many mail. Of course, the first thing you do is get rid of all the mailboxes! You no longer need five, it is too much for you to handle. So your body is like: "Okay, so I get rid of some of the mailboxes, because it is clear that we need less of them to get back to normal functioning." When you suddenly stop taking the drug, you have too few mailboxes and normal functioning is difficult for the body. (It's like, okay, now you get much less mail, because you only have one mailbox. Great! But now you no longer get that massive influx of letters that forced you to remove four of your five mailboxes, and you notice that you're missing out on four letters a day that you used to get and oh! those were actually pretty important.) It takes some time for the body to adapt again to normal functioning. While adjusting, the brain has too few of these receivers for normal functioning, and it causes the so-called withdrawals. The brain has made changes to deal with the exaggerated activity of certain receivers during drug use. When the drug is no longer in your system, these changes lead to withdrawal symptoms. When the brain is in normal functioning, the withdrawal symptoms disappear. (There are some differences for the different drugs. Alcohol and nicotine are strange in particular, but generally speaking, this is what happens.)
As there is no medical evidence that eight glasses a day is beneficial, it doesn't matter. Since caffeine is a diuretic, you will need more water to balance it. The best indicator of whether you're getting enough water is to listen to your body. Basically your urine should be pretty clear, light yellow, and a lot of it. You should urinate 6-7 times a day. Other symptoms of dehydration are headaches, dizziness, dry lips and skin, etc. There are many different factors that change how much water you need. You can set a goal, but especially if you drink caffeine, listen to your body.
I take it you mean tin, in fact, when a liquid freezes it expands. A can of soft drink only contains a certain quantity of liquid, so as it expands it gradually stretches the can, which eventually bursts.
Rice and pasta can contain bacteria whose spores survive cooking. If boiled rice or pasta is left out at a temperature of 12°–14°C for too long (more than four or five hours) it can become extremely dangerous to eat. At this temperature the heat-resistant toxins of the bacteria that produce spores may develop.
Gemstones are the finished product—the cakes. Gold is the flour. It's easier to combine things to create a new thing than to try and create an element. Thanks for the love, everybody! :) And for the rest of you, I appreciate that you take this so seriously. But I realize this isn't perfect! I said precious stones instead of just diamonds, but you're right to point that out. This example is meant to be taken in good faith, with hyperbolic examples for the sake of the medium. But both the short and long answers are good, and you should all keep on learning! Thanks, Reddit, for making this my most popular topic ever, and my first post with karma points!
Why do you know pee tastes salty?
There is a water vapor in the air. This vapor is in a state of readiness to condense into liquid water, when the air can no longer hold it. Now, since the cold beverage absorbs heat from the air, it cools down the air until it can no longer hold the water vapor.
You don’t just cook for health reasons; you also cook for taste and consistency changes. You can kill all the bacteria that are harmful to you at only 77°C or lower for a longer period of time. The only surviving microbes are the bacilli that are dormant, but don’t matter for foods eaten immediately, because they don’t have time to wake up and multiply. But at 77°C the meat has not even reached boiling point yet, and at higher temperatures various other chemical reactions occur. To seal or brown the meat, or to caramelize the sugars, you need to heat it to 140°C.
You know, the fact that it evaporates quickly, but that’s not why it’s flammable, that’s why it’s easy to light on fire, which isn’t quite the same thing. Here’s another flammable substance: magnesium. The melting point of magnesium is somewhere around 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. But it’s not easy to light on fire, you need to heat it for ten seconds, maybe more, in an open flame, because it’s not volatile at all. If you could grind up magnesium into a fine powder and throw it into the air, then try to light it, it would probably go up easily and be extremely dangerous, but don’t try it. It’s unbelievably hot and terribly bright. What makes Rubbing Alcohol flammable is the reaction it has with oxygen. To explain that, I’m not going to use Rubbing Alcohol, which is isopropyl alcohol, but rather a simpler alcohol, ethyl alcohol. When you burn ethyl alcohol, you make it react with a special kind of oxygen. That “special kind” of oxygen is like ordinary oxygen, only it’s extremely reactive. That special kind of oxygen is created everywhere oxygen is found, but the more you heat something, the more of this special kind of oxygen you’ll get. There’s more of this special kind of oxygen in hot air than in cold. Now, here’s the chemical reaction: C2H6O + 3O2  2 CO2 + 3H2O. So, when you burn alcohol with oxygen, you’re actually creating carbon dioxide and water. And that creates heat. It creates heat because CO2 and H2O are more stable than alcohol and that special kind of oxygen. That’s a little complicated, but you just need to know that it creates a lot of heat. Basically, alcohol is flammable because, when you heat it up, it reacts with oxygen, creating heat, which in turn creates more of that special kind of oxygen, which creates more heat, and so on and so forth. Also, there’s a reason it doesn’t get as hot as it does in the beginning, but after a few seconds it settles down, but that’s also complicated. And lastly, you can use something besides oxygen to burn something else, but it’s also complicated.
There is no such thing as an original flame. The fire is the product of a continuous chemical reaction, therefore the flame is always new, even when the candles are burning together.
Water vapor is satisfied below boiling-point. But boiling-point is a special case, because at lower temperatures water occupies some of the air, but at boiling-point it wants to occupy more than all the air. Since it cannot occupy more than all the air, it becomes a gas until it has exhausted the heat, or until it has run out of water. For a more detailed explanation, search the subreddit, as this is a question that is asked often.
The thing about radiation is that, apart from the most extreme cases, it doesn't do anything immediately where it's easy to see the cause and effect. Such extreme cases don't occur in nature, they have to be manufactured. Even in our modern times, only 31 people died directly from Chernobyl, the rest of the effects were in the long-term increase in the rates of certain cancers, and we could only conclude that from statistics and huge samples.
It's called a hydrogen fuel cell. One of the problems is that hydrogen is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, which makes it difficult to store it in a tank. You would need a very high pressure, a very low temperature or a stablizer to hold a large amount in a tank. Unlike gasoline, which can easily be poured into a tank or into a can, hydrogen is a bit more difficult to transport. And a hydrogen tank leaking can lead to a far more violent explosion than a gasoline tank, which just bursts. And then you still have to produce the electricity to make the hydrogen, and that is often done with fossil fuels.
Like other constants having units, it is a measure of the magnitude of the units used. In this case, it is a product of two constants: the Avogadro constant which gives the number of molecules per mole. If the mole was larger or smaller in number, this constant would change, and so would the gas constant. The Boltzmann constant is a measure of the relationship between temperature and energy. More precisely, it gives the average increase in the kinetic energy of each molecule of a gas when the temperature rises by one degree Kelvin. If temperature and energy units were changed, the value of the Boltzmann constant would change, and so would the value of the gas constant. Since the Boltzmann constant is multiplied by the number of molecules per mole, the gas constant is the energy increase per degree of temperature rise for a mole of ideal gas. Or, stated differently, it gives the temperature-energy relationship of a mole of ideal gas at a given temperature, expressed in the units used. Usually, the units are expressed in joule per kilocalorie per mole. In other words, it is a conversion factor between macroscale moles and temperatures and microscale numbers of particles and energy per particle. (We changed the word Boltzmann to Boltzman because it is difficult to spell.)
It wouldn’t explode. It would burst and burn, yes, but it wouldn’t explode. For an explosion, the fuel has to be mixed thoroughly with oxygen, so that everything can burn at once. In your case, only the surface would be exposed to the air.
- Well, the vitamins B are completely unrelated substances. They were all grouped together in the beginning, because they were all discovered at once, and only later did we realize that it was a combination of different substances. There are gaps in the list as well, because we later discovered that some of them weren’t really vitamins at all.
The cold burns because it damages the body physically and kills cells. If you touch a piece of hot metal, the heat enters your hand and starts destroying and killing cells, and this causes the pain-receptors to start working. If you touch an ice cube and your hand or finger feels numb, the ice cube isn't actually hurting you, but merely cooling you down. That's why your nerves don't function as well, and you feel less pain or numbness. But if you touch something really cold, like liquid nitrogen, it is actually so cold that it freezes your cells immediately. And it is this process that causes the pain-receptors to start working.
The yellowing is caused by the residue of dust and perspiration which does not get washed out in the washing water. You must use a stronger agent. That is why the bleaching companies are in the business.
It's not air, it's just steam. When water boils, it changes from liquid water to gas water, but still water. Some of the bubbles may come from dissolved gases coming out as the water warms (because warm water cannot hold as much dissolved gas as cold water), but the big bubbles of boiling water are all steam.
This requires a lot of energy. For oil, the main cost of energy is the energy that microorganisms got from the sun.
- Charcoal is not burnt; it is pyrolised, which is a different process. Plants are mostly made up of cellulose and (for trees) lignin, which are complex substances that contain a lot of carbon. This carbon reacts with oxygen in the air and mainly gives off carbon dioxide and water, which are both gases at the temperature of the flame, and therefore evaporate in the air. (In practice, the flame is usually a little 'dirty' and consists of a number of other things.) This reaction consists of two parts: the first of which is the breakup of existing molecules, which costs energy, and the second which is the recombination of the separated molecules with oxygen, which gives off more energy than was spent on the first step, and both steps together thus give out energy. In the case of charcoal, the wood or other organic matter is heated, but is not given enough oxygen for a flame to develop (for example, because it is placed underground in a heap with a little oxygen). This heating causes the first step of the reaction, in which the complex organic molecules are broken up into mainly free carbon and other things. But as there is no sufficient oxygen for the second step, the reaction stops here. (In practice, some oxygen is introduced, just enough to start the second step, which causes the organic matter to continue to decompose at a sufficient temperature.) This first step only is called pyrolysis (Greek pyro = fire and lysis = decomposition). The result is charcoal, which is almost pure carbon and burns better because many impurities have been removed (especially water, which takes a lot of energy to evaporate), and because no energy was used in the first step.
Imagine a substance so sweet (much sweeter than sugar) that one calorie’s worth is enough to sweeten an entire bottle of Diet Coke. Imagine using that substance to sweeten your drink.
Dry shampoo is a spray powder that absorbs excess grease from your hair. It often has perfume added to it, which makes your hair smell good. It does not clean the hair or wash out dirt like regular shampoo.
Methyl salicylate absorbs the energy of the excited nitrogen and reradiates it in blue light. It's called fluorescence. Sugar crystals also produce a dim glow in this way. They are called tribo-luminescent.
Quantum mechanics says that the electrons of the atoms can exist only at certain specified energy levels. These energy levels are different for each atom and are also different between atoms and molecules. When light hits an atom, it absorbs it and goes to a higher energy level. Then it is free to give out light, but this light, because of the law of quanta, can only have a certain energy, and this energy is determined by the color. By knowing the color of the light, one can determine the atom which gave the light. The spectral lines are read by comparing them with the spectral lines given out by known atoms.
A meat will be tough if it has a lot of connective tissue, which is mostly composed of collagen. Cooking the meat for a long time turns the collagen into gelatin, which gives it the savory flavor. That flavor is bestowed on certain foods because they contain glutamate, a sapid substance found in the human body, which gives them a savory taste. * * * Various food ingredients are rich in glutamic acid, including meats, shellfish, fish sauce, canned fish, canned fish, dried bonito, sardines, and anchovies, as well as tomatoes, mushrooms, dried yeast, meat extract, and soy sauce. * * * If MSG can be considered a vegan ingredient, you can use it.
It’s called sludge or biosolids. It’s basically separated and dried out, then used as fertilizer, I think. (For EPA information:
A powder cocaine is dissolved in water, and is absorbed through the mucous membranes (gums, nose, etc.). Crack cocaine is a cheaper, easier way of making a freebase, that is, making chemical changes to make it possible to liquefy the cocaine into a gas, which can be inhaled. When cocaine is used in this way, it enters the bloodstream much more quickly, which makes it possible to use relatively little cocaine to get a very intense and quick high.
mole is a number, like the number twelve. It comes from the need of chemists to be able to relate the number of atoms to something tangible. A mole is the number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon, which is 6.022 times 1023. So, if you know the mass of your atoms, you can calculate the number of atoms in your sample. It is convenient to go from the “number of atoms” to the “mass of your sample” by means of a quantity called molar mass, which is a number associated with each atom which tells us how many grams it would weigh in a mole.
Neither soap nor detergent breaks down oil; they simply emulsify it and suspend it. It’s still oil, only now it’s suspended in water instead of floating on top.
It’s the opposite for me. A good beer tastes better when I eat a Döner. Perhaps there are certain compounds in the food that trick your tongue into thinking it’s tasting something else. Then you’ll taste less of the beer’s flavour and more of its alcohol.
Gas is chemical energy that gets released as heat when it burns. An internal-combustion engine changes the heat into pressure and that pressure into motion. It does this by burning the gas in the cylinders. This drives the pistons, which turn the crankshaft. And through a series of gears, this turns the wheels of the car and powers its electrical systems.
It reduces the surface tension of water because it contains surfactants, such as alcohol ethoxylate. Water, under normal conditions, likes to clump together and stick to each other. But that would not be a problem if your dishwasher water was pure; it contains dissolved solids, such as minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, and other substances. These dissolved solids are left behind when the water evaporates and your dishes are left with water spots. Dishwasher rinse aid breaks the surface tension so that the water does not stick and, on the contrary, runs off your dishes without leaving a mineral residue.
- The scale of Celsius was first developed, and set 0 as the freezing point of water and 100 as the boiling point. These are remembrance-worthy, measurable temperatures. Later it was discovered that absolute zero is 273.14°C. At some point it was said: "Isn't it better to count up from zero than down from zero? " So a scale was made that started from zero, but what should the scale be? Why not make the degrees the same as the degrees on the Celsius scale, which is already known by all? That is very simple. So we have two scales with equal temperatures, but different starting points.
Common usage defines flammable as “will burn easily when combined with oxygen and subjected to sufficient heat.” Oxygen is not flammable, because it does not burn... in the presence of itself. It is not flammable, but it makes everything flammable.
They begin to absorb air particles, dust, bacteria, and foul smell. This makes them lose their freshness.
yes, the mass of the products and reactants, and the number of each atom involved in the reaction—so long as we're not talking radioactivity. So if we start with a mole of one particular atom, we'll end up with a mole of that atom (whether it's reacted or not).
When a woman gets pregnant, her body starts producing lots of hormones that are needed for the fetus to develop and grow. Some of these hormones accumulate in the woman's urine a few days or weeks after conception. This causes a double chemical reaction in the test, which is why it has two bands. The first reaction basically just detects water, this is the first "not pregnant" line. The second band contains a chemical that only turns color when it reacts with the hormones, but this reaction takes longer. Think of it this way: in urine there is a lot of water, so it is easy to detect, but there is hardly any hormones, so they are harder to detect. So you always get the first line, if you don't get it, it means the test is broken. The second band takes longer to appear, because this is the part that actually "does something."
Just like if we keep a pot filled with water in the shade. The water on the surface takes the heat from the sun and evaporates, leaving behind the water which remains cool.
Because acetone evaporates easily. When volatile liquids change to gas they take a little heat from the environment. So, when you touch acetone a little evaporates stealing heat from your finger.
Water is a rather unique molecule. It is unusual because the water molecule is extremely polar, the hydrogen atoms in its bonding have much more strongly attracted to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen atoms, and this gives oxygen a partial negative charge and hydrogen a partial positive charge. The water molecule is then able to form very strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules. This hydrogen bonding makes the ice crystal very unusually open for a solid, and the liquid water very unusually dense for such a light compound. Combining both of these makes water slightly denser than ice, unlike almost all other known solids. * Water is also unusual in other ways. * * * * It is liquid at room temperature, unlike almost all other light molecules, because the hydrogen bonds make the molecules stick together. Compare CO2 (which is gas at room temperature) or ethanal (boiling point 76°C), which are both much heavier molecules. * * * * * * It has very high surface tension, again because of the strong attraction between water molecules.
LiPO batteries have problems at temperatures below 50° Fahrenheit (10° C). There is a balance between tolerance to temperature, number of recharges, energy storage capacity, etc. Every chemistry has its advantages and disadvantages.
It is best to spray the cleaning product directly on the surface to be cleaned. The cleaning implement is absorbent, and it is impossible to make sure that all the cleaning product will get to the dirty surface. That amount of cleaning product is therefore wasted.
There are hundreds of kinds of cells in the body, many of which only occur in a certain tissue. Each cell has certain projections (receptors) on its surface, which are sensitive to certain hormones, and these differences in the receptors vary from one tissue to another. For example, a drug that acts on the kidneys (for example) has in part the key to a certain receptor that only the kidneys have, in other words, it disguises itself as a hormone that the kidneys are waiting for and only the kidney cells let it in and let it do its job. Disclamer: I'm not a biologist.
The makers take the natural substance from which the flavor is derived, and pass it through a special mass spectrometer. It will tell them what substances it contains and how many molecules of each there are. With this knowledge they can find another source of the substances and make them up into the same formula as before. It's like making a recipe for cooking food. It's all a matter of putting the right materials together in the right proportions.
I don’t understand. What was the sequence of steps in your experiment?
Sometimes the coating protects what’s inside until it reaches your stomach, liver, etc. I know you shouldn’t chew serotonin, because if it gets stuck in your throat and starts to dissolve, it can do a lot of damage.
It’s cyanoacrylate which is an acrylic monomer. When it comes in contact with air, it actually reacts with water molecules which causes it to form a strong, tight bond between two objects.
Space-time, space-time, Einstein's theory of special relativity must take space and time as a single thing. Therefore, if you stretch or bend space, you are also affecting time. For a more detailed explanation of how this “might” work, it's too complex for Reddit.
You can see the stars if it is fairly dark around you. If you want to see them properly, you need it to be fairly dark in the distance as well. We who live a little outside the city know this already: when you look at the horizon you can see a city is a long way off, because even twenty miles away the night sky is fairly light because of all the lights from the city. And this light, which can be seen from quite a distance from the city, that light also takes up a lot of space in the city. This comes from light sources that aren’t aimed properly, from street lights with badly adjusted reflectors. Lights in people’s windows that light up more space than the room, car headlights and so on. * Some lights are deliberately directed into the dark, like the air navigation lights for planes. But those aren’t a big problem compared to all the unnecessary city lights. The whole thing even has a name: light pollution. Light pollution makes it difficult, or even impossible, to make out the stars in the night sky. Or to see, for example, the Milky Way as a sort of cloud between many bright stars. That’s one of the many reasons why astronomers prefer to set up their telescopes on the desert plateaus of places with few inhabitants. (There are more reasons, but this helps to make the idea clearer.)
Cannon is just a fiction. The real thing inside the cannon is a big piston. When the person gets into the cannon he is standing on top of it. When it fires, it only pushes the person up quickly enough to hit the net or whatever it's aimed at, which is not very far away. With a little smoke and noise you have a cannon shooting a person. It would be like you standing on the middle of a seesaw, and fat Kevin jumps from the top of the playground into the other end, sending you flying to a broken leg and a disappointed parent.
The ground is big, so it’s usually quite safe to assume that no matter what we do on the surface, we can’t pump enough electrons into or out of the ground to alter the balance between protons and electrons, so the electric potential of the ground is always zero. Q: Does everything have this special ability? A: everything has it —a little or a lot? The special ability is being big.
Two main things happen inside a star like our sun, and they are in opposition. It’s actually a very delicate balance. At the center, hydrogen fuses to helium with incredible speed. That creates immense pressure and heat, and that in turn causes the center to expand—just as water boils in a kettle and tries to expand and escape as steam. But a star is very, very large, and although hydrogen is light, it is still in enough quantity in the outer parts of the sun for gravity to try to compress it all together. That is the delicate balance. The center is trying to expand, the outer parts to contract. For most of its life, a star like our sun can maintain this balance and appear to shine constantly. But what happens if the constituent elements change? As I said before, the star shines because hydrogen atoms fuse into helium atoms. There is enough hydrogen in the center to allow this to continue for a very long time, billions of years, but eventually the hydrogen will be gone and so will the fuel. And your original thought, that since the star no longer has any fuel, it must collapse, is actually quite correct. Initially the sun will contract as its hydrogen atoms are used up, but as it contracts, the pressure at the center increases (because there are more and more atoms there) and as the pressure increases, the temperature rises. And it will get so hot that a new fusion reaction takes place, this time converting helium to carbon and oxygen. And there are a lot of helium atoms in the center, because the sun has taken a long time to convert the hydrogen to helium—some 12 billion years. With the new, more powerful fusion reaction taking place at the center, the pressure outward will be enough to counteract the force of gravity trying to pull the star together, and because the helium reaction releases more energy, the outer layers of the star will expand. And because of this greater pressure, the star will become much larger than it is now. And as it expands, the temperature of its outer parts will fall, and its color will change from yellow-white to orange-red. Our sun will have turned into a red giant (and raised the temperature of our earth to well beyond what any living thing could stand).
These units are a bit complicated, but 8.4 microsieverts per hour is not so alarming for a short time. You don't want to sit there for a long time, but neither do you have to worry about a longer stay. Your normal radiation dose for life on Earth is about 3 millisieverts, which is 3,000,000 microsieverts. It takes a little over two weeks to get a year's dose in this area, so a short visit to pretend you are doing it bravely doesn't mean much radiation. Anyway, units. There are two things to measure in radiation, exposure and dose. Exposure is how much radiation you absorb. It is measured in grays and 1 gray is 1 joule of radiation per kilogram. That is a lot of radiation and if you get it all at once, it would probably give you a severe case of radiation poisoning, but you would probably survive. To make things a bit more manageable, we use milli- and micrograys. That's not quite right either, because different radiations affect you differently. For example, 1 gray of neutrons is about 2 to 10 times more harmful to your cells than 1 gray of gamma rays. The sievert is the gray times the multiplication factor. That means that 1 gray of gamma rays is 1 sievert and 1 gray of neutrons is 2 to 10 sieverts.
JWT is a very sensitive infrared telescope, so any source of heat will interfere with measurements. Including the earth and the moon. So JWT is in the Lagrange point. The Lagrange point always has the major heat sources (the sun, the earth and the moon) all on one side of the telescope. On this side, the interference shield can be built to avoid interference.
The water is boiling because the temperature has been raised to the point where some of it changes into gas, pushing the rest of it aside and rising in bubbles to escape as steam. When you heat water from the bottom up, the water at the bottom gets hot enough to boil first, the steam is boiled and rises into the relatively cool water, which is still boiling. The steam cools and loses energy until it can no longer hold the water apart as a bubble, and the bubble suddenly collapses, breaking under the water pressure. That is the loud sound you hear, and it goes away once the water is heated throughout and the bubbles can pass through it to escape as steam, with a much quieter explosion at the surface. If you stir the pot of boiling water vigorously as it is heating up, you can get rid of this loud stage of boiling.
On the contrary, moving vehicle creates many dynamic forces in addition to the static force of its weight, and therefore the damage is greater the faster. There are speed limits for trucks on bridges for this reason. It may be that even a heavy-duty vehicle license plate has a special speed for the bridge. In extreme cases, a very heavy truck is crawling on a closed bridge, at the walking speed, to reduce the burden on the bridge.
Sand does move a little. But sand is very small. Even the ocean, which is much less flexible than sand, is deflected by a few meters in a thousand meters deep ocean. Such deflection would not be noticeable on a grain of sand. But the land also bends with the tides. But this is not visible on the level of a grain of sand (it is also not noticeable in buildings because they bend the same way, moving with their foundations). The ground rises and falls by about a foot every day, which is not as much as the ocean because the ground is more solid than water. But on this scale, the rock is also a thick liquid and it behaves as such in the tides.
The salt makes it harder for the water molecules to change into a gas, so it has to be hotter for that to happen.
If the something you are referring to is the whole universe, the best answer we can give you is that if there were nothing we could not observe it. This is the anthropomorphic principle. Q: How do we know there is something rather than nothing? A: To ask why seems more like metaphysics or philosophy than physics.
Intertia is the power of a body to keep the speed it has. Intertia is a numerical value. It is a force which quickens or slows it down. It is the mass multiplied by the speed. A force which is applied in the direction it is applied in gradually gives a momentum to the body, and to stop the body the same force is necessary in the opposite direction.
You have the strength to overcome the pull of gravity. You do it every day, every time you get up or climb a hill. You can’t pull yourself up by your bootstraps because what you pull on counteracts what you’re pulling with, because you’re tied to yourself. You’re pulling with your arms, and your bootstraps are pulling with an equal and opposite force. The net force acting on your whole body is always zero, no matter how hard you pull.
The procedure varies with the gas in question. But nitrogen and oxygen are the ones most easily obtained from the air. When air is cooled in a vessel, the first liquid that condenses is nitrogen. You pour it into a tank, then heat it up to gas, and then send it out to a nitrogen-tank customer. Oxygen condenses next, and the procedure is the same. Argon is also obtained from air. But CO2 is made by a chemical process in which hydrogen and air are combined.
moisture can condense in a container even after it has been emptied.
The danger of MRIs with metals is all about magnetism. Your wedding ring is probably not made of a magnetic material, such as gold, silver, or platinum.
Gravity is expressed in acceleration. As long as you are accelerating, your body experiences weight. As soon as your speed and that of your spaceship no longer increase but remain constant, you experience the illusion of weightlessness. Also, deceleration gives the same effect as gravity. This is why you are pulled back into your seat by the seat belt when you are braking.
The temperature that we feel, the one that we can perceive, is only the rate at which heat enters or leaves our skin. If we touch something hard, it can feel “colder” because it is more efficient in removing heat from our skin than carpeting.
It does not reflect all the light, and so if you look at it for a long time, you can see the silvery surface behind the reflection. If you look at it at an angle, it is even more noticeable, since there is less light outside to reflect. As a matter of fact, it is just like a less reflective surface like a glass pane or a car with polished paint. There, though, so much light is absorbed that you have to look directly at the glass or at the car in good light to see any reflection. And even then, it is a smoky reflection that does not hide what is behind the glass or the color of the car.
The weak force is not manifest in everyday life as is the case with electricity and gravity. So we cannot rely on this to give us an intuition. If we want to understand what the weak force “does,” we should examine the initial and final conditions before and after the process of a weak force mediated particle collision, and we must make a thorough study of the present and past situation, including the properties of the particles, their energy, their momentum, etc. This gives us a beginning of an intuition about the effect of charged and accelerated weak force collisions: we have a knowledge of the energy of the initial particles and the momentum and the energy of the final particles, which we have reason to know will appear in the form of some new particles. Leaving the interaction point with a different momentum. As you mentioned, the most interesting consequence of accelerated charged and accelerated weak force collisions is that they are the only natural force that can convert one kind of quark into another (for instance, enabling fusion reactions in our sun).
rocket engines produce a lot of thrust. For example, the Falcon Heavy is capable of delivering up to 215,100 kilograms of thrust during takeoff.
When a car is moving at a fixed speed, it experiences no force other than gravity and the normal force of the earth (I’m ignoring air here because this is physics 101 and air doesn’t exist.) So a car moving at 40 mph experiences the same force as a car moving at 60 mph—namely, zero. When you’re hit by a car, you go from zero to the speed of the car in a fraction of a second, so the force on your body is tremendous. But the car is slowing down a little, because the force is equal in both directions.
Yes. In general, it is dangerous to be near a thunder in the water. Water is a good conductor of electricity, and so there will be considerable current flowing and emancipating the fishes. If it were not true, the electric eels could not have discovered it.
It is because in order to bounce, it must have the capacity to absorb the entire impact energy by elastic deformation. If you slightly bend a spring, you will see it springing back to its original shape when you let go of it. This is the elastic deformation – it is changing shape for a while and then springs back to its original shape. But if you bend it much, it will not return to its original shape. This is called the plastic deformation. In this deformation, the energy that goes into deformation is converted into heat. In elastic deformation, it is converted into mechanical energy. The elastic deformation varies with the material and the nature of the impact. For example, a steel ball may bounce on a concrete floor if it is thrown with light force. But if it is thrown with heavy force, it will not bounce much and it will leave a dent on the ball or the floor. It must be remembered that both the ball and the floor will be deformed. A carpet deforms more by plastic deformation, and so the ball does not bounce much on it. The interesting thing about carpets is that the friction involved in their movement helps the ball to bounce. The carpet fibres are rubbing against each other, so that the impact is not elastic.
I'm looking for a method that will tell us more than the red shift in light. It will also tell us about time itself. If we reverse the order of things, the whole would come back to the point where everything was once again in a single place. There are many assumptions in this process, but different methods yield more or less the same result.
Yes. Ice cream melts slower when the temperature around it is closer to the temperature of the ice cream.
The smallest black holes are the stellar-mass black holes in the center of a galaxy. But the formation of the largest black holes is still a mystery. These are far more massive than the stars, and some of them have grown larger than thirteen billion years of vacuum accumulation could produce.
Your air-conditioner produces air at about 35° to 45° F, which you feel when it combines with the air in your room, to maintain the desired temperature. In the opposite direction, when your heat pump is heated to 72° F, your heater is producing air at 110° to 170° F, and you are feeling it circulating in your room, as it mixes with the room air to maintain the temperature you want. Outside, the air is heated or cooled more or less evenly over a given area.
You have only to drop a pebble into a quiet pond and see what happens to the ripples as they pass on. The same thing happens with sound. You hear it first as the ripples pass over you, then you no longer hear it at all. Then, if you are close enough to the shore, you may hear it again as the ripples pass over you again—it is the echo. But at last the ripples are so far apart that you no longer see them (or hear them, in the case of sound). If there is a slight breeze, the water is ruffled, and this is why we hear less well if the leaves are waving in the wind.
The color of an object is the color of the light it reflects. If an object is white, it reflects all the colors. If an object is red, it reflects only the red color. If it is black or any other dark color, it absorbs almost all the colors and reflects very little. That's why black things get hotter than white things in the sun. When white things are black, they reflect the light, and black things absorb the light, and absorbed light turns into heat.
It is an atom bomb because it is powered by the splitting of atoms. Only certain kinds of atoms can split and release their energy, and at the same time split and release their energy when they come into contact with atoms of a similar kind. They are called fissile atoms, and only fissile atoms can be used in atom bombs.
: Why should you not? Why is it not possible? Because the car would get wrecked, either by a slide or by a roll. The car has a lot of momentum, and if you want the tires to change direction too much and too quickly, they cannot do it. Secondly, why can't you do it? Well, you can, but it's harder. And it's harder because the cars are designed that way. And this is the short history of power steering: in the beginning, there was no power steering. The steering wheel was directly connected to the tires, and steering was really difficult. To turn the wheels at low speed when you wanted them to turn a lot, it was really hard. You needed a lot of strength. Then power steering was invented, and now when you turned the steering wheel, the car sped up and assisted you. It was much easier to drive than before, especially when you wanted to turn the tires a lot. However, there was a problem at high speed. It was so easy to turn that when you only wanted to turn a little, like at high speed, the steering wheel jumped around: there was no control. So they made it a power steering with speed adaptation (or various other names for the same thing). They made it so that at low speed it helped you turn the wheel a lot, so you could drive easily, and at high speed it hardly helped, so you could drive comfortably and so you wouldn't turn too far by accident.
What kills you is the energy, which is volt x amp. Volt is like the pressure between two points, the potential difference. And amp is like a flowing liquid, the flow of energy. Now, when n volts are being claimed for the current, half of them are lies and the other half don’t have enough energy to hurt you.
Electomagnetism is the force of the movement of the electron. Electomagnetism is carried by the particles of light. The visible light is only one form of the light waves. If I move an electron, its force field propagates in the form of a wave. Like when you thump on the water, and the pressure waves move through the water. The wood does not move, but the force field carries the force. Electomagnetism does not need a medium.
In a real world, air resistance slows you down, the faster you go, the more fuel you need to maintain your speed, because you must use more energy to accelerate up to the point where you can overcome air resistance.
You’re hot. And when the air’s still around you, you heat that air and stay inside your own warm bubble. So wind blows that bubble away and replaces it with room-temperature air, which you now have to warm up again (which robs you of heat). Similarly, when you want to cool down hot food, you can blow on it and replace the warm air on top of it with room-temperature air, and that’ll cool the food.
According to our current understanding of physics, there is no hard limit. However, the expansion is not so great that it can pull apart the objects held together by gravity or other forces, so that as long as some structures exist, they will be able to withstand the expansion of space. However, the structures are not eternal as we understand them today, and it is very likely that in the far, far future, the universe will consist of isolated particles, especially photons, which are so far from each other that they cannot be observed by anyone. How can it stretch? The expansion was innumerable billions after the Big Bang, so we are already in a very, very stretched universe.
You are describing a hidden variable theory. But it is known that no hidden variable theory where the hiddenness is local (in other words, local in the sense that it is a property of the particles themselves which cannot be transmitted faster than light) can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics. The only way to get this to work is to assume that the particles communicate faster than light or that there is some kind of base level to which all particles have access no matter where they are (which is in essence the same).
The crystals are the spatial representations of a certain shape. The symmetry of the pattern is repeated in the crystals and the molecules. Time is the same as space, so if you scale it up from three dimensions to four by adding time, you have a regular symmetry over time. So this is a time crystal. It's interesting how to use it. We cannot extract energy from it without violating the first law of thermodynamics (if a change in time, which a pattern is, can be utilized and harnessed, without requiring some energy, the rule that energy cannot be created or destroyed is going to be a problem), so the application is unknown.
It has to do with the difference between the speed at which the object spins and the speed at which your eyes (or the screen) can refresh. If they are the same, the object may look like it’s not spinning. If the object is spinning slightly slower than the refresh rate of your eyes, it may look like it’s spinning backwards. The fan seen on a small-screen TV. Let’s say you have an old TV, one that refreshes only once a second. If the fan spins at the same speed, its blades will always be in the same position every time the TV takes a picture. They will spin all the way around between refreshes. But if the speed of the fan blades is a little slower, say 0.90 rpm slower, the fan will only make one full turn between refreshes. Since the fan will only have completed 90 percent of a full turn in the time between refreshes, when you compare the two images, it may appear that the fan has spun ten percent backwards.
It depends on how they were killed. If they were blown to bits, the arrow would probably go with them. If they were run over by a speeding car, even if they were shot dead while holding the arrow, it would probably fly in some other direction. I don’t know. It’s possible it would miss or not even be fired.
I think wind is caused by the difference in heat on the ground. The heat rises, the cold falls. And the difference in the way these two forces act upon each other, builds up the energy, which is dispersed by the wind.
The air is flowing into the ear canal and is held there by the eardrum. This creates a high-pressure bubble which the incoming air must circumvent, and this decreases the amount of air hitting the eardrum.
Watts are only the product of volts and amps. Watts are the unit of "power," how much total energy is flowing through the circuit in one second.
Our two eyes are a few centimeters apart, and when our brain calculates the 3D shape of the object from the difference between the two 2D images, it does so by comparing the differences. At a great distance, the differences become so insignificant that we have the same 2D image twice, and thus there is no 3D shape to calculate.
A huge block of metal under your hood, generating a lot of heat. Your car's "heater" is nothing more than an ingenious way of harnessing this engine heat and using fans, dampers, etc. to control the amount of hot air getting into the car. As for the windows, they are gradually heated, and the glass is super-strong, tempered, laminated glass, designed to withstand sudden temperature changes, impacts, etc.
No. A bumrush means speeding up, not slowing down. Huh? If you're asking if it's possible to use friction to slow down a fall, well, yes, that's what you do if you grab on to something to stop your fall.
Power is equal to torque times r.p.m. At low speeds, most of the power is used up in keeping the engine running. At mid-range speeds, the engine produces more power, but the friction losses haven't really increased, so the engine starts to work more efficiently and so makes more. At high speeds, it becomes harder and harder to get enough air and fuel into the engine, so the crankshaft speed drops.
You're only partly right. Those times are true, but only for those circumstances. It's possible to boil water in less than 3 mins, and to freeze it in less than hours. It all depends on how much water, and how quickly or slowly. Energy can be added to water, or taken away from it, and both of these processes can be carried out in different ways.
Current (amperes, I) is the number of charge particles moving. The more they pass through your body (and especially your heart), the worse it is. Voltage (V) is the amount of force trying to move the particles. It's determined by the source of electricity (a nine-volt battery, for example). There is a fundamental relationship between current (I) and voltage (V): Ohm's law. V = IR The "R" is resistance, the impedance to the flow of charge particles, the greater the higher. Ohm's law states that a higher resistance (poor conductors) require a higher force to move charge particles through them. So a given force (voltage) will move fewer charge particles (current) through a poor conductor (high resistance) than a good conductor (low resistance). Your body, especially your skin, has very high resistance (when it's dry). This means that the current at a given voltage is quite low and therefore can't do much damage. But if you change the resistance suddenly by nicking your skin or getting it wet, the same voltage will now give you a much higher current that can kill you. By the way, there is something called micro-shock, which is a small current passing through the heart directly and stopping it. This usually happens only in surgery where the heart muscle is directly exposed to the source of electricity.
gravity. Most cities rely on water towers. These have two purposes. They store water. (So a pump can be run at full speed to fill the tower, then turn off until the tower is needed.) They’re what maintain water pressure. To do this, water towers are usually built on hills and they’re often the tallest things around. So as long as your house is lower than the water tower, gravity will end up pushing the water down to you, because the overall drop of the water tower is greater than the height of your second-story ceiling. But if you live in a high-rise building downtown, they have to pump it up there. Still, many buildings have a water tower of their own, built on the roof or the top floor. This gives you the pressure you need by making use of the power of gravity.
As it is infinite, it does not end. By “end” we understand merely the limit to which we can see with our present instruments. We call that limit the observable universe. Q: But if you could see something else beyond the edge of the universe, what would it be? A:
a nuclear power station has a radioactive material for fuel. It starts a chain reaction in which the neutrons hit the atoms of other materials, which then, in turn, also shoot out more neutrons. But these high-speed neutrons must be slowed down a little to have a better chance of hitting another atom. That's where the moderator comes in. There are several things that can perform this function, even just water. To control the reaction so that it will be spread out over time instead of releasing all that incredible energy at once, there are also control rods in the midst of the reaction, which also absorb the incoming neutrons instead of slowing them down. The explosions of these flying nuclei which break the atoms as a cue-ball breaks a billiard-table, create heat, an incredible amount of heat. This is absorbed by the primary circuit, a water-circuit which circulates around the core, keeping it cool and also absorbing the heat. It is then passed through a heat-exchanger where the primary water heats up secondary water (the primary water which has been subjected to radiation is not allowed to leave the building), and it is the secondary water which is converted into steam, which drives the engines. Nucleonic reactions are atoms losing pieces which hit other atoms and break them up, which creates heat. The heat is collected and used to run a steam-turbine.
A. In terms of direct observation, it is true that we can only know about the atom and its constituents in a theoretical way. However, we can be fairly sure they exist. We know that, for example, molecules are not made of just atoms.
The air is dry. The skin is wet. In the wind there is a lower pressure than in the still air, and so the moisture on the skin evaporates more quickly and also more quickly loses heat. You feel a cooling effect.
This is basically the same as having a cup of water and twirling it in your hand. The centrifugal force generated by a barrel roll is greater than the force of gravity. As a result, the liquid stays inside the cup. If you were to roll the plane on its wing, it wouldn't work.
Yes, the weight is a major factor. The shape of the blade is designed so that all the force is concentrated on one point of the blade. The extra weight gives the blade more 'punching' power. This was also the reason why in the late middle ages knights went to axes and maces, using their swords only as a sign of nobility and distinction, because they were ineffectual against plate armor.
All available paths are always available to the current, but the path with least resistance will naturally have the most current. Now, when the resistance of a human body is way lower or way higher than the alternative, then this “less resistance” rule is a reasonable way to predict the path that the most current will take. But that only applies to conductors and resistors. Insulators experience something called a breakdown where the resistance drops dramatically with sufficient current, that’s what causes arcing through the air. This means that the path with only a small lower resistance will instantly become the path with much less resistance when the voltage is sufficient.
It's about angular momentum. When the arms act like pendulums, they limit the direction of motion. That way, the legs can focus on acceleration instead of stability.
As the temperature increases, the viscosity of water diminishes. This change is sufficiently marked to produce a difference in the sound. It is the same as in engine-oil. Starting the car in cold weather sometimes creates unforeseen difficulties, for the cold oil is thicker and has to warm up before it can do its proper work.
Depending on how cold it is, when things freeze, they can only form ice crystals when there is a good place to begin the crystallization. The good places are for example sharp corners in the container, places where the liquid is disturbed by stirring or agitation. It's like putting a jigsaw puzzle together, it's easier to start with the edge pieces. So when a can of beer is sitting still in the icebox in a clean, smooth beer can, it has not much good place to begin with. This lets it cool a little below the freezing point before it begins to freeze. When you pour beer, you create good places for it to freeze when you pour it into the glass and mix everything up. When a few ice crystals have formed, the whole beer can begin to freeze. This is also true for boiling. If you heat water in a very clean glass in the microwave oven, you can bring it above the boiling point without it boiling. If you shake the glass or stir it with a spoon, it suddenly boils, which can be dangerous if you are not expecting it. It's the same thing, except that you need good places to begin the bubbles instead of the ice crystals.
Light has no mass but it does have momentum, and momentum is conserved! So when a photon bounces off the mirror of the sail, the momentum of the sail and the photon together must change if the momentum of the sail and the photon together is the same after the photon strikes as it was before! In more detail, less eloquently: * * * In classical physics, momentum requires mass, but that is only a partial picture; general physics is a more complete picture. * * * In general physics the equation E=mc2 is only a part of the equation E=mc2+2p2c, where p is momentum. Since light has no mass, we can reduce this to E=pc2, and for a photon with E=hc/l, where h is the Planck constant and l is the wavelength, we get: p = hc/l. So a shorter-wavelength (bluer) photon has more momentum!
In physics heat is energy that has been transferred from one body to another, from the warmer body to the colder one. Just think of ice cubes. Put ice in a warm room, and the energy of the warm room is transferred to the ice, warming it up and causing it to melt. And put a glass of water in a cold room and the energy is transferred from the water to the room, which lowers the temperature of the water, and eventually it freezes. So how does that relate to our body? All living organisms are actually an orchestra of complicated chemical reactions. You are alive because of many, many complex chemical reactions that are constantly taking place in your body. One simple example is the process of digesting food, in which the digestive enzymes produced by your body help digest your food. But you might remember from chemistry that temperature affects chemical reactions, so those digestive enzymes will not work properly if you are too cold, and will even start to break down if you are too hot. Because of this, cold-blooded animals like lizards must heat themselves up in the sun to be able to digest their food. But warm-blooded animals like you produce heat inside your body and carefully control the temperature of your body, to keep the chemical reactions inside you running smoothly. So you produce heat in order to keep the temperature inside you at just the right level. But you also try to cool down if you get too hot. For example, you sweat, or your blood vessels dilate. If you get too hot, your blood vessels dilate to allow heat to be dissipated from your body through the skin, and that’s why you turn red. When you are not able to control your body temperature properly—for example, because you are in a room that is much too cold or too hot—you begin to suffer. Eventually you can suffer very seriously. Hypothermia and hyperthermia are just names for the various symptoms you can experience if your body temperature is affected by too much heat or too much cold.
From what I know it's a soundproofing. Like a transfer of air from inside to outside. With one window open, the rushing air fights back. The sound of a helicopter is created. But with the second window open, the air has a path to escape, it runs through the second window and not through the window from which it came in.
You were created by your parents. The closed time-curvature necessary to form a causal loop in time is at best a theoretical possibility. More likely, the universe prohibits such loops. In the same way, it is theoretically possible to travel through space at any speed. But the universe is limited to a speed of c.
Water is more effective than air at absorbing and releasing heat. Air at room temperature releases heat 43 times faster than water at room temperature. Water also has a higher heat capacity, which means the amount of energy it takes to raise its temperature by 1 degree. It can absorb a great deal of heat from your body but rises in temperature by only a small amount. When you put your hand into water, it takes the heat away from your skin more quickly than air does. Your skin cools to the temperature of the water, but the still air cannot keep enough heat to cool your skin down to the room temperature. Therefore, water is always colder than air.
Every particle in a cloud of dust and hydrogen is moving basically in all directions. But they don’t quite cancel each other out. And when gravity collapses the cloud and (if there’s enough mass) a star forms, the disproportionate spin of the particles and molecules determines the speed. Reproduce this on every scale and it applies to everything.
To go up, one must push something else down. On the ground, this is easy, but when you're in the air, you've only got the air and whatever you're carrying.
I don't know why this was flagged, it's not a question, there's a clear answer. The universe is big, and has always been big. We can already see very old light (it's called the cosmic background radiation), and JWST will be the best view ever. The light is old because it's been traveling for a long time, because it came from a long way away. When it was emitted, it was billions of light-years away from the matter that eventually became Earth (but not 13.1 billion light-years away, because space expands and because of relativity). The universe didn't start as a single point, so it didn't start from one place and go outward. The Big Bang was the universe going outward from everywhere.
This is the best way I know of explaining it. Picture a container which contains four marbles. Think of all the possible positions the marbles can be in; they could be at the bottom of each corner, they could be in the top corners or in any number of other positions. Now increase the size of the container. That means the marbles can occupy more positions. Entropy is simply the number of possible positions molecules can occupy within a given space. The greater the number of possible arrangements, the greater the entropy. So let’s take one more example. Suppose you put a rubber ball in an oven and turn on the heat, which causes the ball to contract. Now the ball is smaller inside the oven because it’s contracted. Would you say the entropy of this system is higher or lower than it was before? Since the ball is smaller, but the oven is the same size, the entropy is higher. A third example. When comparing the different states of matter – solid, liquid, and gas – solids are more ordered. The particles are closer together and hence there are fewer possibilities of arrangements. On the other hand, in gas form the particles are further apart and therefore can take up more arrangements within a given volume.
It would not spoil because it would immediately dry out, since at such low pressures water boils at room temperature. (And with neither water nor oxygen available, bacteria would have a hard time.) However, it wouldn't last forever. It would be bombarded with cosmic rays until the molecules disintegrate.
The surface of any object is not perfectly smooth, but has rough or smooth spots. The rough spots make the object slide on each other. Friction between the surfaces produces a force that resists motion. This force is called friction.
What you are asking is, how do individual organisms, and even the enzymes in them, restructure molecules? It is all a matter of patterns. Take the following example: the molecule: to the enzyme: “Hello, molecule. Nice little set of keys you have there. I’ve got a lock for it. Don’t know why, but I don’t like it very much.” “Whoosh, that’s nice, let’s go.” “Ha-ha, I’ve just cut off your arm. But don’t worry. Just use your right hand to grab the stump of your left arm. Take my word for it.” “You crazy fool, this is so cool!” (To another molecule) “Hey, I’ve got an arm here. You want it?” [Chemist explains:] Enzymes break molecular structures with stronger binding properties. That’s the case for only a small part of them. There are more ways to break molecular structures than simply cutting off an arm. But I thought that was the funniest thing I’ve ever heard.
The difference between room temperature and hot things is greater than between room temperature and cold things. A cold thing at the freezing point, which is 41° Fahrenheit, is about 15° colder than the room, whereas a hot thing, in order to keep the food safe, must be kept at a temperature of about 140° Fahrenheit, or 27° hotter than the room. Another reason is that the vacumn-seal only prevents conduction of heat because there is no way to conduct, but it cannot prevent radiation, which is caused by the heat-emitting bodies emitting small quantities of radiant heat, at our temperatures, usually infrared. Although the containers are silvered to limit this effect, the radiative exchange is so great that a very hot thing may overcome this effect.
Basically, wave-particle duality is pretty well understood and described by quantum mechanics, it's only classical mechanics that has trouble with it. The basic quantum mechanical object is the wavefunction, which can be more or less localized (particle-like or wave-like).
Electrons have weight and mass, but electricity is not the same as the electron. Electricity is the movement of the electron. Like the atmosphere, electricity has weight, but perhaps the movement of the air does not have weight.
they can gimbal their engines (or at least some of them, if they have several). This is called gimballing if the entire engine is moved, gimbal being the name of the support that allows for this. In addition, they have all kinds of tricks inside the nozzle for directing the thrust. But whichever way you cut it, they have a way of keeping the direction.
The problem isn’t the speed but the braking. If you have to come to a halt from 10, 50, or 100 mph in the same time, the 100 mph one will, obviously, be the hardest one to stop, but if you can come to a halt at a higher speed gradually, it may be less dangerous than coming to a stop at a low one. Your car’s crumple zones, air bags, and other safety devices are all designed to reduce the time you (or, more precisely, your head) take to come to a halt. You can jump from a great height into water and come out relatively unharmed, but falling face-first onto concrete may hurt you badly or kill you; the water slows you down gradually, the concrete stops you suddenly. Similarly, when you drive into a tree or into a wall, you stop very suddenly even at low speeds, despite all the safety devices designed to help you. If you ski into a tree at high speed, it can be very deadly. When you ski into the snow and fall over, it takes you a few seconds and several yards to come to a halt, which makes it a lot less deadly. Wearing a helmet, wearing warm clothing, and falling onto relatively soft snow all help. The less you stop, the less danger.
Besides X-rays, alpha, beta, and neutrons, gamma rays are dangerous because they have enough energy to strip the atoms they strike of their electrons. This is what cleaves the molecular bonds, and even though the damage to large molecules in a large structure is not usually caused in the short run, it does occur over a period of time, and the most familiar example of this is the breakdown of polymers under the influence of sunlight. In the body, important cellular parts such as the DNA strands are pounded to bits by gamma ray bullets, and so they can no longer perform their functions. In the short run, the cells die, and a person falls ill or dies. If one survives the acute radiation, other damage, such as DNA damage, may be observed in later life.
Quantum mechanics. He lives in a dimension of time and space that we humans cannot yet comprehend.
If you ask how, then I must answer that a single packet doesn’t get divided into two packets. One packet spreads itself, goes through the two slits and spreads out in interference beyond the slits. All this is one photon.
The discovery of the atom was made in 1827 by Robert Brown. Einstein only explained how the speed of Brownian movement could be used to determine the size of the atom and molecules. (Einstein published the special theory of relativity in 1905, the theory of the quanta of radiant energy, and the theory of Brownian motion, all in 1905, all in his spare time, because during the day he worked as a patent attorney. These three very basic works could have been the peak of a whole career, but he went even further in his later years.) And their size was only roughly known, from a comparison between the heat of vaporization and the surface tension, made around 1805 by Thomas Young of the double-slit experiment and the famous astronomer and mathematician Laplace. (See: https://www.lumenlearning.com/physics/chapter/30-1-discovery-of-the-atom)
It adds its own weight to the weight of the water in the pool. That is to say, if you had a balance scale at the bottom of the container, it would increase in value by the amount of the added weight. But there is a common "trick" question: If a stone is floating in a boat, and if you take the stone from the boat and drop it into the pool, will the level go up or down? (A: It will go down. Because on the boat, the stone displaced the water by its weight, but at the bottom it only displaces the water it occupies, which is smaller.)
If it's shot really straight up, it stops completely in the air when it reaches its maximum height. It loses its aerodynamic shape and on its way down it tumbles and falls... not in a safe way, but its maximum speed when falling is much lower than it would be. The Mythbusters have already done the test. I would not like to be hit, but I think you would survive it if you had a half-decent helmet. If it's shot diagonally up, it will continue to retain its aerodynamic shape, and if it reaches its maximum height, it will come down as a fatal projectile, with its front edge, even if it comes down from a distance. There are already cases of people who were killed at a great distance, when someone shot up. The Mythbusters called it a busted, a confirmed and a plausible myth, because there were already real cases of people being killed, but also it is a hard thing for a human being to point the gun up and fire. Shooting straight up is not lethal, but you don't have to do it that way, because you wouldn't do it that way.
Because there is so little pigment to so much base that you have to stir and stir and stir to make sure that the little bit of pigment gets through that whole five-gallon bucket. The viscosity and the lack of space to move around in the can also contribute to this. It would be better if the pigment dissolved in the base, as a dye does in water. But in fact paint is just a vehicle for the pigment.
Gravity is a fundamental force, for which, as far as we know, there is no reason why. It is. All matter with mass experiences an attractive force on all matter with mass, or all mass curves space-time, if you’re an Einsteinian.
As a flight attendant said, it's a loophole. A: Airline pilot here, I think you were on some regional jet, such as EMB-145, CRJ-700, CRJ-900, etc., since you said "below," and the EMB-145 and CRJ-200 are "above"; and as for large aircraft, almost never face such conditions. On the other hand, the weight of carry-on luggage is included in the weight of passengers. At my company, the average passenger weight was increased a few days ago, and the average passenger weight is reviewed every year. When the aircraft is used on the runway, the weight of the aircraft should not exceed the weight of the expected runway. The takeoff runway at a large airport is usually long, and the maximum takeoff weight can be greater, and at a small airport, the prevailing wind is one runway, and it is more limited. Other reasons include: the distance to accelerate and stop (V1), obstacles to climb, the altitude of the airport, and other unknown factors. I hope this helps. Edit: you didn't say "below", so any of them should be okay. Edit2:? "?
Why does it? The “why” questions are not genuinely answerable in science. They are actually irrelevant. That’s how mass in space-time works. That’s the way the universe works. It used to be thought that gravity was a force, and scientists searched for a graviton to transfer the force. But there has been no graviton. This has scientists stumped.
Probably this light has a large amount of invisible light in it, but you can't see the exact amount of it. This price tag has an orange fluorescent pigment that absorbs short-wavelength light, and it can be lighted up with any short-wavelength light. Blue light has the most striking effect, because it can't be seen from the sides, but it seems that it can also be lit up with this.
They are created. They appear. This is not uncommon in high-energy physics. Particles like the photon require much less energy to be created than do the other particles, and consequently they are much more easily created. The creation of an electron-positron pair can occur in sufficiently intense electric fields, but for the creation of a proton-antiproton pair it would require a much higher intensity.
Time is the distance between events, just as space is the distance between objects. Nothing can experience time backwards.
Both. There is no fixed radius of danger around it. It’s not like some kind of a definite bubble around the material, in which you are fried, but outside the bubble nothing happens. But the radiation does weaken the further away you get. If you had twice as much radioactive material, you’d get twice as much radiation up close, and also twice as much radiation at ten metres, fifty metres, and a kilometre away.
If you weigh 98 pounds and you eat one pound of carrots, you’ll be 1% carrot. If you weigh 98 kilograms and you eat one kilogram of carrots, you’ll be 1% carrot. There’s nothing inconsistent in these two facts, and from the way you ask the question I think you’ve got a few misconceptions about percentages.
you can absolutely mirror radiowaves. A satellite dish does just that, focusing all incoming radio waves onto a single point in the center of the dish.
Everything is made up of atoms. The outer part of an atom is composed of particles called electrons. Every atom has a fixed number of them. If the atom has more or fewer than it should, it is called an ion. Since ions have an unequal number of electrons, they want to get to the right number. When an atom has a surplus of them, it is said to be positively charged. If it has a deficit, it is negatively charged. You know how magnets have north and south poles. They are just a kinder way of saying positive and negative. Things with opposite charges attract each other because they want to swap their ions so they are all the same. When you rub certain materials together, one of them loses an atom to the other, making one positively charged and the other negatively. We say they are ‘static’ because they will not touch until they have swapped their ions. If they are positively charged and you hold them near a wall, they stick because the wall’s atoms have a normal number of ions but the static object wants to steal them. It eventually does, and then the difference in charge between the wall and the object is lessened and the object falls off. This does not permanently charge the wall because the wall is so big and it is also connected to earth. If the wall has a charge, it takes ions from the earth until it no longer has one. If it was a magical, floating house, it would be able to build up a charge. (Or you would need to build it in such a way that the earth could not take it, but that would be very dangerous.)
The car and you are going at the same speed. Then the car suddenly slows down. You still want to go on and go on, and you are stopped by the seat belts from going straight through the windscreen. All the soft parts of your body keep moving forward as far as possible, around the seat belt. All the soft parts of your body have stretched out, and all the kinetic energy is now stored in the stretched parts. They bounce back like a spring. The stored energy is transformed back into kinetic energy, but the arrow is pointing in the opposite direction—towards the back of the car. As an added bonus, the secondary collisions can also propel the car forward, if it’s not a head-on collision. But, in the simplest case, you rebound from the seat belt or from the dashboard just as anything else does. The whole point of the seat belt is that it gives you a much larger surface to rebound against than your face or knees. The seat belts also have a bit more give than the hard steering wheel of yesteryear, so they absorb some of the shock. EDIT: I forgot about the secondary effect. Depending on how the car is pushed, the front might dip down while the back rises up. If the car leans up like this, a lot of the energy of the collision is transformed from kinetic into potential energy, and the weight of the car is loaded against the front. Then, when the back leans back down, the result is to push you back like the hammer of a trebuchet. The seat belts are just a small trebuchet. The trebuchet can now get you back where you came from—which is into the seat. But it’s extremely important to adjust the headrest when you get into a car that has them. It should be high enough so that when you lean back, the center of your head is lined up with the center of the headrest. This will stop your head rather than your neck, and prevent you from going backwards, twisting your spine and neck.
I think you are imagining the middle C of the piano. This produces a wave that oscillates at 264 cycles per second. This means your ear hears a wave that vibrates 264 times a second. Imagine playing middle C while someone is speaking to you. You will distinguish the piano from the person, but your ear hears only the vibrations in the air. The brain is able to distinguish between the sounds of the voice and the piano, because of the software, not the hardware, which is what your ear is. Speakers produce sound waves that are precisely at the frequency of the different instruments of the recording. It vibrates your ear at the right frequency. Your brain can then tell which bits are the drums, bass, guitar, voice...
No sound, no noise. Noise is vibration. Vibration takes energy. If you imagine solid matter as points connected by springs, the stiffer the springs, the louder the vibration. The stiffer the spring, the more energy it takes to deform it. But the stiffer the springs, the more energy they have to give up to go back to their original positions. That's why stiffer materials make more noise because they let out more energy in the air as vibration.
But that should only make the car go forward. Where does it get the force to move it sideways? They are pushing the car forward. But since the front wheels are turned, where the car is going is constantly changing. The rear wheels are moving fast enough, and the front wheels are turned sharp enough, that there is basically a "lag" between where the rear wheels want to go and where the front wheels are heading. The rear wheels are pushing the car forward, but the front wheels are pushing the front of the car forward, so the rear of the car moves around the point of rotation.
The motion of the universe, or the motion of everything in it, with respect to its own center of mass, c. It is a common misunderstanding of special relativity, and the concept of speed. Speed is the spacetime equivalent of velocity; it measures how fast something is moving in spacetime (that is, space * and* time), and must be the same for all inertial observers (the most basic assumption of SR). Since the only speed-like quantity that is the same for all inertial observers is c, the so-called speed of light, “the speed limit,” “the universal speed,” “the speed,” etc.), then speed “4” must be c by definition, and the mathematics works out to be c. But that doesn’t really tell us anything useful. And it isn’t the “c” that we usually think of as “the speed of light,” but a “4” speed, a subtle distinction. It isn’t even the sum of speed 3 and speed of light, but more like the difference between them. In general, there is no such thing as absolute speed, unless you count c. Motion (not acceleration) is always relative to someone; you can always find a frame of reference in which something appears to be motionless (yourself, for example, from your own point of view).
Probably not. As we said, we have a pretty good idea of what happened in the universe up to about one picosecond after the event that is conventionally called the big bang, which is about 0.000000000001 seconds (more or less). Before that, the universe was roughly a million billion billion times smaller than an atom. At this scale, the laws of general relativity (the apparent laws that seem to govern the whole universe and large things in it) clash directly and unavoidably with the laws of quantum mechanics (the apparent laws that govern how small things act). Both seem to be flawed when applied to a sardine tin containing the whole universe squeezed into a space smaller than anything we can imagine. In a certain sense, the mathematics don't work. We'd have to 'divide by zero' in a literal and figurative sense, and our mathematics don't allow this.
A Tesla coil is a special kind of electrical circuit that is designed to generate very powerful radio signals. It is achieved by the high voltage of the air in which some low-ionizing gases are created and in which their atoms are disintegrated. This causes the low-ionizing gases to be ionized.
The more violent and abrupt sound is caused by the bullets striking the target. The smoother, mechanical, steady thud is the sound of the gun firing. You hear them separately because bullets travel at a speed far exceeding that of sound. Of course, you can hear the same effect with a turret on other aircraft, and this is not exclusive to the A-10 and its GAU-8 gun. But the A-10 is more well known because the GAU-8 is a larger and louder weapon, which is almost exclusively used in ground attack. Since it is mainly seen in the Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq wars, it is also more familiar.
It is a very wide term. If two particles interact, it means they have an effect on each other, and it can happen in many ways. The simplest example is that of two particles of the same charge, which repel each other when they come close together. This is a manifestation of the electromagnetism force. If an electron and a proton come near each other, the effect on them is a force that is attractive rather than repulsive, because of their opposite charges. But there are also complex cases in which the particles change into other kinds of particles, for example when an electron and a positron (the antiparticle of the electron) come close to each other they annihilate and emit two photons, and two photons can also produce a positron and an electron.
It’s basically the same thing as... light. You know how light gets redder the longer its wavelength? Well, if you go all the way down you get radio waves. That’s why we can’t see them.
There is a subtlety here. Particles of the EM spectrum (photons) do not actually move up and down. Particles in the EM spectrum only cause vibrations. They do not move up and down. However, a mechanical wave (such as sound) can be considered a result of the interactions of the neighboring particles. If you imagine the atoms of a solid as a string of particles, connected by springs, which represent the forces between particles, then, if you take one of these particles and pull it up, you will see that these forces on the neighboring particles will push it down. Newton's third law says that for each force there is an equal and opposite reaction. The neighboring particles move up when they pull the original particle down. Now more particles are pulled up, they are pulled down by their neighbors, and their neighbors are pulled up again. So on and so forth. The original displacement then spreads along the material like a wave of up and down motion.
We are currently watching literally millions of objects, from tiny fragments to large dead satellites. The ISS station is protected by what is called Whipple shielding. It's like a heat sink for a graphic card. There are a lot of small and thin rods. Space junk is moving so fast that it usually disintegrates at impact, sometimes even to molten metal or even to a completely different state of matter, to plasma. The first layer of Whipple is very thin and would not be able to stop the collision itself. But he breaks the space junk at the first collision. The resulting collision is therefore distributed over a larger area that Whipple can protect against. In addition, the station moves away from the space junk that we follow so closely. If there is even a tenth of a collision risk, the station is just moved so that the tracked junk passes by. It still happens, however, that we get hit. This year, for example, one of the parts of the station's robot arm was hit and damaged by a fragment, and we had to repair it in space. Kurzgesagt has a great video about how problematic orbital debris is in the long run.
Induction is the principle at work. The charger has a coil that conducts electricity. This creates an electro-magnetic field, which charges the phone. Inside the phone, a special rectifier, which converts the EM field into electricity, recharges the battery. However, the conversion has some losses, and it's only about 92% efficient compared to the charging via a wire. And it's slower.
It is certainly possible. See en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor. The problem is to extract more energy than you put in, including losses due to ion collisions and other factors, so that the reaction is sustainable. (And also to get enough saleable energy out to pay for what you put in.)
On the Planck scale, the laws of physics break already. If a photon were to have a wavelength of that size, it would also break the laws of physics. Some have tried to fix this problem. It is actually not a great thing that something "breaks conventional physics". This has happened in the past, and we have got over it. It just means that our models are somehow lacking.
If you see a right particle, then you know that the entangled left one is a left particle. But nobody else knows unless you tell them the right one. If someone tries to measure the left twin, the entanglement is broken and the result is random. The other would have to ask you if the result is correct. This takes us back to the speed of light. Measurement and interference break the entanglement. Quantum mechanics say it decoheres. That means the particle enters the system of the one who measures it. (EliannaRys' answer is better.)
It is simpler. We would have to change a lot of equations and cause many confusions. Wouldn't we have to reverse the magnetic field too? Or, do we make many of the equations negative? Or, we just change the sign of the negative charge and call it positive? Why? No one who is supposed to know the difference ever gets confused, and it does not really matter to most people.
Red  orange  yellow  white  blue; It will become blue hot when you heat it far enough, but in reality it cannot become blue hot. 6500K is the color temperature of the sun, and 8000K is the color temperature of the blue. At this time, iron is about 3,000K. Even tungsten is about 5,800K.
why not ask her and have her explain them to you on your date?
- There is no such thing as "traveling with a certain force. " Something can be accelerated for a certain time with a certain force and then go at a certain speed. But the mass of the object and the time it takes to accelerate are also factors.
Everything reflects the light that falls on it. The difference with mirrors is that they reflect light in the same way it came in, without destroying it. For example, if the light is reflected at right angles to the mirror's surface, it will also be reflected at right angles. If it comes at an angle, it will be reflected at an angle. This is always the case; the mirror is not changing according to your movements, but you are moving to a position where you can see what it has always reflected.
I don't understand the question, but we have helicopters, planes, rockets... The best we can do is to consider gravity a fundamental property of all objects that have mass. Imagine four people holding a sheet at the four corners. The sheet is perfectly level and you can roll a ball from one end to the other almost in a straight line. Now put an orange in the middle, the sheet is sagging under the orange, now, if you want to roll a ball from one end to the other, the ball will fall on the orange. Gravity is the same, but in three dimensions. Everything that has mass deflects space-time towards itself so that whatever is near it is pulled away from it, or even towards it. Gravity is not a thing or a force, but a property of the universe.
Basically, they are related to the amount of "advantage" which a lever and a winch give you. A lever or a pulley can make a heavy object move, because they transform a weak but large movement into a small but strong movement. For example, by operating a come-along, you move a meter of the long lever with your arm, which is transformed into moving the heavy load one centimeter. If you do this (divide the distance by a hundred) you multiply the force by a hundred, and so you can handle a weight you could move with 50 kilograms by hand, but with the help of the come-along you can handle a weight of 5,000 kilograms. When using a ratchet strap to secure a load, the lever you move is much shorter and therefore moves less. But you have to know that if the end of the lever moves ten centimeters and the ratchet strap moves one centimeter, your force is multiplied by ten. So you convert your strength of 50 kilograms into a strength that can lift 500 kilograms. When the strap is pulled to the point where it feels as if 500 kilograms are pulling on it, your strength of 50 kilograms is no longer enough to tighten it any more. So, in essence, a come-along has a longer lever to give you a larger advantage.
it passes through an infinite number of points in any positive time. It may be useful to remember that the time it takes to move is infinitely divided, just as the unit length is infinitely divided.
The air in the car is still 25° C, but when the window is open, the air circulates briskly, and because the moving air is slightly cooler than the temperature of the human body, it is felt to be cooler than the still air—hence the wind chill factor mentioned in weather reports. It is also the reason why a fan blowing on you feels cooler than the air in the room, even though the air is at the same temperature.
It can't. That's not true at all. There are plenty of times when it's not visible when it's night where you are, because the world isn't flat.
An absolute vacuum contains nothing; it is, in a word, void. Space, on the other hand, is the space outside a planet's atmosphere, and contains the helium of the sun's rays, spaceships, comets, asteroids, and many other interesting things that the vacuum, by definition, cannot contain.
; First of all, you're not creating a vacuum by pushing on the bulb. What you're doing is pushing the air in the bulb towards the tip of the tube. Now, when you let go of the bulb and it wants to go back to its original shape (we'll come back to that), the liquid in the tip will be pushed in. Basically, the liquid in the bulb has a certain tension to it and, being a bulb, wants to be flattened, not squeezed, so, when it's flattened, it fills with air from outside and the liquid is pushed into the tube. A very good question.
This phenomenon is called cavitation. When a bullet is fired into the water, or a blade rotates rapidly, they produce a vacuum behind them. If the vacuum is deep enough, the water will turn from liquid to gas and this is the source of the bubbles. They are made of water vapour.
I am a hearing scientist with a PhD in sound localization. What you hear are sine waves, very clean sine waves. They are often very high-pitched. One of the ways you could tell where a sound is coming from is by the difference between the times when the sounds arrive at each ear. The sounds come first to the ear closest to you. But that doesn’t work so well with sine waves because there are so many distinct frequencies. For the higher sounds, the wavelength is close to the size of your head. And if you miss the start of the sound, it’s impossible to tell which ear gets it first, because the sound repeats in the same order. The lower the sound, the easier it is because the size of your head limits the amount of difference between the start and finish of the sound. With complex sounds, it’s much easier to tell which ear gets it first by comparing the whole complex signal. But the most reliable way to pinpoint a sound’s location is by the difference in level between the ears. The higher the pitch, the more reliable this is because the lower sounds can bend around your head better and so the difference in level is less. If the sound is between the two frequency extremes, it’s impossible to use either method. But even if you can use the difference in level, the head is pretty symmetrical. We can tell left from right, but it’s not so easy to tell top from bottom. The way out is to move your head, but if the sounds are short bursts, there’s hardly time before the burst is over. Your brain has to make a rough guess as to the position of the next sound. This is why Tesco vans in Britain now use radio-like noise bursts when they reverse. Edit: Thanks, kind strangers. I take this opportunity to remind people not to use cotton buds (Q-tips) unless they want a perforated ear drum. And also to wear hearing protection. Rock concerts are loud! Get yourself some good quality earplugs. Noise-induced hearing loss is not nice, and it can’t be cured.
The two eyes in front of the head allow simultaneous two-dimensional vision, which the brain translates into three-dimensional vision. There are a number of other things that are going on here, but essentially the eyes allow us to determine the speed and direction of an object, and then you can predict its position. Practice makes perfect.
They are designed to open inwards. The greater air pressure acts as a force holding the doors closed.
Moving electrons make electrical energy which is used to do work. In D.C. the flow is in one direction, in A.C. it is alternating. The only way to understand this is to visualize the work of a saw cutting through a tree: D.C. is like a saw which can only be pushed, so you need a long saw to cut through a tree. A.C. is like a saw which can be pushed and pulled and so you need only a short saw to cut the tree.
Specifically, the problem is that you can't know both the speed and location simultaneously, indefinitely precisely, and that's a principle of quantum mechanics. But the question isn't actually why can't you know them both. This is because it's not a matter of "not knowing"—it's not that these quantities have values that "practically" can't be known. Quantum mechanics, in the early twentieth century, showed that in the physical world it's literally impossible for these two quantities to have simultaneous values of infinite precision. And it's not just a question of momentum and location; there are many different combinations of quantities that behave this way in the quantum mechanical treatment. You can get a little insight into the question by experimenting with a waveform generator in an audio editing program: if you choose pulses or sine waves from the waveform generator's menu, you can display both the corresponding waveform and its Fourier transform by clicking on the appropriate buttons. You'll see that a pulse with a very small amplitude can't be represented by both the amplitude and the spectrum of the waveform. These principles don't affect us in our everyday life, because their effects are too small to be measurable with rulers and speedometers when applied to things like people and cars.
Because a lot of math was created to model the universe, and the universe— for some reason—appears to obey a fundamental set of laws that do not change.
We can transmit it over long distances with low losses and a cheap installation. We can also modulate it to send signals. And we are good at changing back and forth between electricity and other kinds of energy. Other common means of transmitting energy are: heat, but there are high losses in the long run; kinetic, but the transmission line would be heavy if you had to go over long distances (a long series of shafts?); chemical, but we haven't gotten very good at converting chemical energy directly into motion without first converting it into heat (hydrocarbons and combustion engines) or electricity (battery and motor, fuel cell).
Because they are very far away. If you hold a stick at one end and move it slightly, the other end will move a great distance, and the farther the stick is the greater the movement. Similarly, the farther an object is from us, the less we have to move our heads to see it, and because we have to move our heads so little to see it, it seems to move very slowly to our brains. The brain is surprisingly bad at grasping three-dimensional space.
[eli5] A typical formula for the conversion of colors into shades of gray is.299 R,.587 G,.114 B, which agrees with your experience. And then the human luminous efficiency curve is less sensitive to blue than to red. (But note that the opposite is true for scotopic vision.)
The lens bends the light and changes its direction. Light shifts when it passes through different media. A drinking straw looks broken when seen in a glass of water. Lenses are used to form the image of light. In order to make the glass bend light properly, the edges are curved. Depending on the curvature of the edges, you can magnify or reduce the image by changing the direction of each ray of light. It is possible to change the focus. If the lens were purely square, it would be difficult to focus the whole image in the same way because the curve of the edges of the glass would not be the same everywhere. The film is square because it is easy to store in a square shape. Besides, if the image of the rectangle is familiar to people, they are also familiar with it. If you cut the negative, you can make it work, but a strip of film is most efficient in a long line of squares or rectangles. If you made a round film, the whole thing would be stuck in a cylinder. And it is inefficient in a small space.
The star is sending light in all directions, so some of the photons hit you, some of them reach your neighbour who is a few yards away. A star sends out a tremendous amount of light per second, so much that it remains visible even after being spread over millions of miles.
The angular momentum (the way stuff rotates around a particular point) is always conserved. In every sink, tub, or other vessel containing water, there’s a certain amount of random motion, and so the angular momentum in the vicinity of the drain is usually not zero. As the water drains, it approaches the center of the vessel, and to conserve the angular momentum, it has to go faster, like a skater who draws in his arms to accelerate his spin. It forms a spiral, because it increases its own spin as it moves toward the drain. It is theoretically possible for the water to go straight down, but practically speaking it is virtually impossible.
This is often seen on the videos of the rotation of the objects. The reason is that the speed of the recording frame of the video is often different from the speed of rotation of the object being recorded. For example, if the frame of the movie is made at 30 frames per second and the wheel rotates 30 times per second, then when the frame is made, the wheel will have already made a full revolution of the circle, and so the wheel in the movie seems to be slow. If the wheel rotates a little faster, like 30.1 times per second, then each frame of the movie will be recorded after the wheel has made a full turn, and so it will seem that the wheel is turning slowly. If the wheel rotates slower than the speed of the frame, then it will be recorded just before it makes a full turn compared to the previous frame. The same applies if the wheel rotates at 60 times per second. The wheel will rotate twice between two frames, but when the frame is taken, the wheel is in the same position as in the previous frame.
AM radios need only a very simple device to “demodulate” the sound—a rectifier. A bad rectifier circuit can sometimes be built quite by accident, for instance by touching two dissimilar metals or a metal and a conductive liquid. Even a mouthful of saliva can do it! If the radio signal is very strong, it can overcome the bad efficiencies of such circuits, causing them to vibrate like a speaker.
They're not really temperature, just color temperature. The color temperature is the result of using varying wavelengths of light.
Trucks are heavy. On downhill grades the trucks have to stop their heavy loads at the touch of a pedal, which means that the brakes heat up. But as they heat up, the brakes become less effective, so they need to be applied even longer, which means that they get even hotter, and so on. On a mountain road, this can result in the loss of the braking capacity, and the truck can go barreling down the mountain with no control. So a slope and some sand, built next to the road, is a small investment to prevent a possible death-dealing crash.
-It depends on what you mean by “time and space” and “have a beginning” and “have an end”. “Time and space” could be time, in the sense of human scale, and space as in a certain area or volume. It could also be time and space as a four-dimensional manifold. “Have a beginning” and “have an end” could be a time when a thing exists and when it does not exist (the verbs “to end” and “to begin”) or it could be physical or non-physical limits on a variable (nouns “end” and “beginning”). “Human scale time” cannot end because it is essentially a description of how fast certain things happen and how long it takes them to do it as many times as there are events. It cannot end because it is not a thing, it is an idea. A day is approximately the duration of radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of a caesium 133 atom. It will not end. It is a derivative of a frequency, not an intrinsic universal property. One can argue that it will have an end when there are no longer people to use it, and a beginning when the first people start measuring durations, but that is too philosophical, I think. Space, as an area or volume, can definitely have beginnings and ends, and that is the easiest one to understand. A football field has ends that are beginnings and vice versa, it is only the edge of the area. The observable universe has an end that is a beginning: the point where light has not yet had time to reach us, so that it is physically impossible for us to see and travel there. A football field can have an end and a beginning when it is torn down and built again. The observable universe has a beginning, in the sense of having started to exist, when the universe became transparent to CMB, and it could have an end, either by ceasing to exist or by something else making the whole area unobservable. Bigger black holes would do that (for aliens, their universe is different). The trickier interpretation is whether time and space has an end and a beginning and can time and space end and did time and space begin. No matter if the universe is flat, open or closed, it is probably spatially unlimited. See here for the wikipedia article on the shape of the universe. It means that it is impossible to travel to the end and the beginning of the universe, either because it would return to where it came from, or because it would travel a path that would not come back to itself, but only traversed a finite universe, or because it would not come back. The universe is not temporally unlimited, and that is where spacetime comes in. There is at least one limit on spacetime, and that is probably the Big Bang. So you have a four-dimensional manifold with a beginning on one of the dimensions. One of the faces of the infinite four-dimensional cube that is spacetime is located. This is the only face because the other sides are infinite. In three dimensions, it would be like you would make an infinite cube by adding an infinite line to five of its six sides. You can still find the sixth face, but do the other sides exist at all? But that dimension you are adding is not x, y, or z, it is time. Nevertheless, it gets even more difficult, because spacetime is a manifold that includes time, and time does not exist before 13.7 billion years ago, and there is no such thing as “time before the Big Bang”. It is completely senseless. The Big Bang is what started time. If you identified a time before, then immediately there was no longer a time before, because you needed time to define where (when?) you were in the manifold, and therefore you could not be talking about the past before there was spacetime. Thus, the beginning of spacetime is the beginning of spacetime, but there is no time at which that can be defined, except for the beginning itself, and it cannot be identified by a time in any way, that is, a time not relative to itself. Do you understand? No? Fine. Moving on... Spacetime could have an end, but we don’t know yet. There are some theories, such as the Big Rip, the Big Crunch, etc. But, for the same reasons as the beginning, saying when it will end makes little sense. It will end when it ends. The best you can do is predict the duration of the universe according to its own axis, but since spacetime will no longer exist, there will be no where or when to observe and measure that end. Besides, the progression of time is not the same in all parts of the universe. It depends on what happens, so you will have to choose, and it will be almost impossible to do, what scale of duration you will use. In conclusion, “time like on a clock” is a scale. “To end” and “to begin” are meaningless for it. Space like your backyard is spatially limited. Perhaps it has a beginning, and maybe it has an end. When it became your backyard and if it ceases to be your backyard, it began and it may end. It has a beginning and an end, but it is only a continuous edge, not one or the other. Spacetime began and had a beginning in the – time direction. It may end and have an end, but we don’t know. It would be meaningless to say “when” these events happened/were/will happen, because you would have to define them relative to themselves, and this is still meaningless. It’s like saying: “Where are my keys?” “They’re in the same place as your keys.” [I’m not making this clear enough, but it is important to remember that time is not the same as duration, time that passes, or time that has passed. Time can be defined by a single number, but duration must be defined by at least two.]
We know very well what electricity is; electricity is the transmission of power through the motion of electric charges. The context of the text, and the general tone of the lecture make it clear that the speaker means: “Most people have wrong notions about how electricity works.”
Because it turns out that the train analogy is wrong. Speeds do not add up in this way, only in the sense that the error of such an addition is insignificant in most everyday situations. The train analogy is a piece of popular science that is not a physics law. The fact is that it does not matter how fast you go or in which direction you go. Light always propagates in a vacuum with a speed of 'c', neither more nor less. There is an extremely famous experiment that proved this to be true. [Edit: about the train analogy: let's say you're on a train going at X miles per hour and you fire a gun in the same direction the train is going with a muzzle speed of Y miles per hour.] At the moment you fire the gun, you pass a person standing on the ground outside the train. Both of you now see the bullet moving in the same direction as the train. You see the bullet go at Y miles per hour relative to you, and the person standing on the ground sees you go at X miles per hour relative to him, but he does not see the bullet go at X+Y miles per hour relative to him, but the speed of the bullet relative to the standing observer is strictly less than X+Y, regardless of the speed of the two observers, and the faster the velocities involved, the more the error of the addition of the speeds. At the extreme case (i.e., the bullet is fired at a speed equal to the speed of light), you and the person standing on the ground both see the bullet propagate at the same speed, which is 'c'.
Because air is pretty light. If you have a small air compresser with a capacity of twenty liters, the air in the tank will weigh, say, 25 grams at a pressure of fifteen pounds, which is not much. If you turn on the compresser and make it operate at fifteen pounds, which means fifteen pounds over atmospheric pressure, i.e. 15 PSI, it now weighs an extra 25 grams. You don't have to worry about the 15 pounds pressure as indicated by the pressure gauge because it's internal pressure and only applies to the walls of the tank, not to the force you need to lift it. If you turn up the pressure to 150 PSI (pretty high for a home garage), the tank now has eleven times as much air in it and weighs an extra 225 grams, which isn't much. Now let's assume you get yourself a real high-pressure compresser that you can put together with your tiny tank, and it gets up to 3,000 PSI. You now have 200 times as much air in the same volume, so the tank weighs an extra 2.2 kilograms, which is a fair amount. This is a critical point for diving tanks because the more air you use underwater, the lighter you become, gradually improving your buoyancy.
Firstly, splitting an atom isn’t dangerous at all, it gives off a negligible amount of energy, you wouldn’t even notice it, and indeed it would be very difficult to detect even if we wanted to. But the thing about radioactivity and atomic reactions is that it’s not a question of splitting one atom, but splitting a whole heap of them all at once. When you split a thousand billion atoms in a split-second the amount of energy that is liberated is enormous, and this is what makes atomic reactions so dangerous.
Are you referring to films of engines running on the dyno? Cameras have a rate of frames per second. Usually, 30 frames per second. So they take a picture every 1/30th of a second. These are then rapidly run back, and you get a film. Imagine a wheel with six spokes. If it makes one turn of one sixth of a turn per 1/30th of a second, it appears not to turn at all. Of course, it turns, but the spokes remain in the same positions, and so you see no change. If it speeds up, and turns a little more than one sixth of a turn per 1/30th of a second, each successive picture of the wheel will have the positions of the spokes slightly displaced. It will appear to be slowly moving forwards. Now, let it speed up, and it will turn a little less than two sixths of a turn per 1/30th of a second. If it were exactly two sixths, it would appear to be standing still again, but it is a little slower, and so the frames per 1/30th of a second are slightly less than two sixths. This means it will appear to be turning backwards. Of course, this is only a camera effect. You cannot observe it with your own eyes and a fixed light source. Fluorescent lights flash at 50 or 60 cycles. In effect, they are a high-speed strobe light.
They are wrong. The gravitation is there in the Earth’s orbit, which is why the moon keeps orbiting around us and doesn’t go into space. In the ISS and other orbital spacecraft, the spacecraft and everything inside them moves so fast that they experience microgravity, because the gravity of the Earth pulls on them, the air and everything else in the same way. It keeps the whole system in the orbit and gives the impression (from outside the spacecraft) that people are floating without gravity. No gravity.
Those massive speakers are very directional because sound travels so slowly. So you want the audience to only hear the sound of one of the speakers, because a speaker that's ten meters farther away will lag by a tenth of a second. In a large sports stadium, the speakers on the far side of the stadium are significantly delayed and that causes the sound to lag a lot, which makes the sound very distorted. But low-frequency sound (bass) cannot be controlled, at least not with speakers that are practical. The wavelength of the bass is so long that you'd need a gigantic speaker to be able to control the direction. So you hear bass from all over the place and you can hear the bass from the far speakers, but they're noticeably late.
You have thrusters, tiny little rockets (or sometimes you just blow high-pressure gas) on the side of the ship. The reason gravity doesn't work in space is that there's no air for aerodynamic surfaces like ailerons and rudders to operate against.
it does not run out, but it can lose its inclination. Imagine a large magnet as a number of millions of small magnets, each with its own inclination. If you jumble up their orientation, the magnet loses its power, but as soon as you realign them, the magnet regains its power. This is why we can magnetize the steel.
mirror images are neither flipped horizontally nor vertically. They are reversed along the front-back axis. Stand in front of a mirror and point left or right (horizontally) or up or down (vertically), and your reflection will point in the same direction. Point towards or away from the mirror and you and your reflection will suddenly point in opposite directions.
Diametrically opposite ends. A thing has to turn a certain number of times, no matter what size the two ends are. But the fat end will cover a greater distance in a given number of revolutions.
Water is not "heavier." If you have any substance in a completely sealed container, then freeze it, melt it, evaporate it, condense it, etc., then the weight remains the same. Ice is less dense, because when it freezes (the ordinary way we know it — there are other strange kinds of water that occur under special conditions) it takes on a crystalline structure that increases its volume. Same mass divided by increased volume = less density. Ice floats on water because of this lower density.
There is something called the fire triangle, and the three legs of the triangle are oxygen, heat, and fuel. If any of these three elements are absent or unavailable, the triangle falls, and the fire goes out. If the wind is strong enough, then although the fire has oxygen, the wind cools it off more quickly than the fire can heat up. Fire is just a chemical reaction, and the reaction rate is fixed, so the heat rate is also fixed.
Because the vehicle has springs. When the brakes are applied, the vehicle’s weight transfers to the front, increasing the force on the front wheels. When the weight is no longer applied as you slow down, the remaining energy stored in the springs is suddenly released, causing a brief, sharp shock. This is partially reduced by the shock absorbers, but it is still a shock resulting from something like two thousand pounds on the front wheels. During a coasting maneuver, there is no weight transfer, and the car is losing energy through friction alone. The springs aren’t being charged, and there is no release of energy when you finally come to a stop.
Water has a particularly good absorption of infrared radiation, and as the human skin is composed of a large proportion of water, we are well adapted to feeling infrared heat.
We can do that, and there are various ways to produce a high quality industrial carbon dioxide. The problem is the cost and the fact that it has to be done in such a way that it is enough to make a difference. The common way to just catch CO2 is adsorption: a tank is filled with a special material that absorbs CO2, and then high-pressure air is pumped into this tank to fill the material with CO2. The air is then released, the material is heated, and it is again released with high-quality CO2 that is used to produce, for example, sparkling water. This works very well for several hundred tons of CO2, but meanwhile about 30 billion tons of CO2 are emitted annually in industry and electricity production, so you have to make energy again if you want to get O2 and C, for example. How much energy? Not less than was emitted when it was CO2 in the first place, and then you must now use fossil fuels and produce CO2 to catch and sort less CO2 than you have just released? This does not work very well. Plants do it by catching light from millions of square kilometers and using it as a source of energy for their reactions. We can also build huge solar cells (and we are working on that) but it is usually easier to just plant trees and let them do their job. Until we get fusion up and running and profitable, it is of course not possible to capture CO2 because it all only works with the energy of fossil fuels, which also reduces the effect.
Because at the temperature where people live, everything is infrared and this glow rises rapidly as the temperature rises. If our temperature were higher, everything would be in the visible range, as can be seen when heating a piece of high melting-point metal which, beginning as dull red, turns bright white.
From what I read on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_time), it seems that in order to model certain phenomena, it is necessary to use imaginary or complex numbers, rather than real numbers to represent time. It is a bit like owing money before there was a special system of negative numbers: it is very clear that one owes ten units of something, but the positive number system cannot express it and so a special system of negative numbers must be used.
They are very often put into orbit. SpaceX for example can sometimes send up a couple of satellites every month.
cobwebs are made of spider silk, a soft, strong, pliant, silky substance produced by spiders for the purpose of catching prey and building their nests. The term “cobweb” is often used in the context of an old, perhaps dusty abandoned web.
To evaporate a liquid you need to have an equal pressure inside and outside the liquid. A lid will raise the pressure, but you can't make it evaporate. But water evaporates even when its pressure is lower, because it absorbs energy from its environment, which excites the molecules, and the water at the surface separates from the rest and turns into steam.
The Manhattan project suffered from the same basic problem as we do today: if the bomb explodes, the bomb should also have enough time to develop a critical mass, so that the chain reaction develops. So the question is: how can one pack a whole bunch of plutonium in a tight sphere that will explode? The yield is increased by slowing down the explosion and letting the bomb last longer. But even so, some of the plutonium will fly out of the bomb before it has time to go critical, so that the theoretical yield is less than 100 percent. And even then the yield will not be 100 percent, unless one assumes that the technology has advanced sufficiently to stabilize the core of the bomb for the critical period.
Nope. If you go to a grocery store in Estes Park, CO (elevation 4,400 m), the chip packets are properly inflated.
It is strange, but hard in this sense does not mean indestructible. It means only that it is difficult to scratch, or, better still, that it can’t be scratched by something less hard. Glass may be an example. You can rub it against a piece of wood without scratching it, yet you can break it if you throw the wood at it. The wood is “less hard” than the glass because it does not scratch it. Similarly you can scratch glass with your fingernail, which is harder than glass, but you cannot break it with a nail. Hardness in this sense does not imply indestructibility, but merely that it is difficult to scratch. Diamonds are so hard that they can’t be scratched by almost anything else, yet they can be cut or broken.
Basically, it's a different mechanism. In a conventional bulb, the wire heats up and produces light by what we call "black-body radiation": in other words, the atoms in the wire vibrate very quickly, and this vibration is what we see as light. In an LED, a different mechanism is used: the electricity pushes the free electrons over a certain barrier, and when they are over, they return to normal and give off light. Like pushing a rock over a mountain. It is therefore almost impossible to make wire bulbs that are not orange / yellow, since high temperatures are needed, which are harmful to materials or people around them. But with LEDs, since nothing gets hot, you just have to find the right material and the right "mountain height" to get the right color.
It does me, too. But I suspect it’s because I drink beer, and I urinate a lot of salt, besides using up my body heat warming up the cold pints. But the best thing about alcohol is that it poisons you—it’s a poison, really. It’s a combination of methanol and ethyl alcohol, the deadly poison.
In a collision with a wall, all the energy of the collision is absorbed by the interior structures of the car, which is the real source of damage. In a collision between two (identical) cars, the total energy is greater, but it is distributed evenly between two sets of identical structures. It goes without saying that this may not apply to non-identical cars.
The more massive an object is, the more it bends spacetime around it. [Visualize this here]
I suppose you mean magnetic flux density. For example, the Earth’s magnetic field is great in the sense that it covers the whole planet, but its flux density is small enough so that iron objects do not always point north. The unit of magnetic flux density for a single, uniform magnetic field is the gauss or the tesla. 1 tesla = 10,000 gauss. It is difficult to say how strong that is because it depends on the size and shape of the magnet being measured. However, if your refrigerator somehow produced a magnetic field of one tesla, a magnet of one centimeter would weigh two or three kilograms. The magnetic strength of a permanent magnet with a definite north and south pole is measured in units of the earth meter per gram.
Everything keeps moving in a straight line unless you bother it. A pendulum swings back and forth. A nice and simple operation; you lift it up, you let it go, and it swings back and forth, straight, and this will continue to be so forever (unless friction gets in the way). Imagine placing a pendulum (with a frame) on a turntable, like a microwave oven (do not do it at home!) ; if it is freely suspended, there is nothing to turn it, and the pendulum will go on going back and forth as the turntable turns. This is what Foucault did in 1851: he hung a large pendulum from the ceiling of the Pantheon in Paris (removed soon after, and restored for a while in the nineties). As time went on, the pendulum seemed to be spinning. But the pendulum should not spin. If it doesn't spin, it must be that the earth is spinning, and the pendulum is standing still! And it is a very regular, a very foreseeable operation, so much so that you can use these pendulums as clocks by looking at the apparent rotation of the pendulum.
If you heat your house with electricity to drive induction heaters, then the electricity to run your appliances costs the same. If you have another heating system which involves an electric heat pump, then it costs less to run appliances than to use the heat pump. I assume that all other heating systems are more energy efficient than electricity. From an environmental point of view, it depends on how your electricity is generated compared with the other heating sources. Even if you heat with electricity, the heat pump will be better for the environment.
Beer is a gaseous liquid; that is to say, it contains a quantity of carbonic acid gas dissolved in it beyond the limits of its capacity to hold it. This carbonic acid gas escapes slowly and in time will exhaust itself; but under ordinary conditions this does not take place immediately. When you strike a beer bottle the bottle is very rapidly depressed; but the liquid within it is not depressed at the same speed. This creates a vacuum under the liquid. This vacuum causes the carbonic acid gas dissolved in the liquid to precipitate very rapidly, which assists in the process of filling the void. When the liquid actually falls down, the carbonic acid forms many bubbles, which are in fact only gaseous clumps in the liquid, and this causes the sudden foaming. A popular street trick to break bottles is to do the same thing with a bottle of water instead of with a bottle of beer.
If the screeching is only when the hot water is being used, the fault is most likely only in the hot water piping or faucet parts. Either the stem valve or the washer is loose or something is caught inside the hot water pipe. Another possibility is a stretching of the hot water pipes. The expansion of hot water entering the pipe stretches it. The metal pipe stretches against the metal clamps, which makes a short screeching sound. The clamps and the metal pipes should be replaced.

simplified version: electricity running through the wires creates a magnetic field. But it works in reverse, too. A moving magnetic field can create electricity in the wires. A strong solar storm is a large amount of charged material moving quite fast for us. There are also very strong magnetic fields spinning in that mass. Sometimes these storms can be detached from the sun and come to our planet. The earth has its own magnetic field which creates the Van Allen belts. This usually protects us from the electrical, magnetic, and radiational energy of the sun. But if the storm is strong enough, it can overcome the Van Allen belts and reach the surface of the earth. When this happens, every wire on the planet converts some of this energy into electricity in the wire. The more powerful the storm, the more electricity is created in the wire. Most of the appliances can’t handle this additional electricity. They are destroyed by the additional power. Our electric grid consists of millions of miles of wires, which are great collectors of solar energy. So you can have blown transformers, fried generators, and so on.
Flowers dry out over time. The flower is flexible because of the humidity, the humidity evaporates and the rigid, fragile fibers remain. Pressed by the book, it dries flat and stays flat.
The expansion of high pressure air (or any air) brings down its pressure and temperature. The water vapor in the air condenses as the temperature drops. This is the same process that creates a cloud.
I’ll explain this by using an analogy with boats. On flat water, a boat moves straight forward. But if you add waves, the boat moves up and down, or left and right. Well, an aircraft doesn’t move on water, it flies in the air. In fact, it floats on air thanks to the lift provided by its wings. So if the air is calm, the aircraft will fly in a straight line. But if the air is disturbed (in other words, imagine a wave rolling over: that’s what air turbulence is). Now the aircraft isn’t harmed by turbulence, it’s designed to cope with much more powerful turbulence than it encounters. But if you’re in the aircraft when it’s being jolted, you might fall and hurt yourself. So that’s why we’re asking you to stay seated and fasten your seatbelts!
Entropy is a thermodynamic quantity that measures the degree of disorder or randomness of a physical system. It's like having a jar full of small balls; if you throw it on the ground, there will be a lot of disorder, because that's the way the universe goes, it keeps increasing that disorder. If you want to rearrange the small balls, you must provide energy to the system (to decrease the disorder). In other words, to act against the trend of entropy, you must provide energy, otherwise the universe tends to decompose everything.
They are usually fastened with Velcro fasteners so that objects can be stuck on them so they do not float and harm machines or people.
One of the theories that I was told about is that people with mental disabilities don't have the neural signal to their muscles that tells them, "Stop, more than this will hurt you. " The other theory is that the young boys' hypothalamus may be firing all the time. In any case, both theories explain the phenomenon.
Imagine two interacting conditions, pressure and temperature. At a given pressure, the more likely the hydrogen is to be a gas. But, at a given pressure, the more likely it is to be a liquid or a supercritical fluid, regardless of temperature. The temperature and pressure at the core of Jupiter are such that liquid hydrogen is possible. What is wrong is to assume that all liquids have less energy than gases. A liquid at high pressure and temperature can have more energy than a gas at low pressure and temperature.
In a closed system without any external forces (that is, the angler is holding the rod and the fish is pulling the line with its own weight) then the tension in the line is equal to the fish's pulling power. The drag can be adjusted so that the line can only be pulled in when the tension in the line is above a certain point. In practice, the tension in the line is a little higher because you also pull the rod back/strip it. Then the tension in the line is how much you pull back plus how much the fish pulls away. It is therefore so easy to break a line when the drag is too high, because the line is not allowed to be pulled out and the sum of the forces is greater than the line can withstand. A bit of extra tension stuff:... assuming the string is massless (which is reasonable for a fishing line) and that the tension is constant throughout the string. In practice, if the string or rope has some measurable mass, then the tension will vary depending on the mass and how gravity acts on it. So, for example, if a rope was hanging and a weight was hanging on the end of it, then the tension in the end of the rope was just the weight of the rope at the end. In the middle, the tension is the lower half of the rope plus the weight. At the top, it is the weight of the rope and the whole weight. If it is falling, there is an even greater tension. It is even more complicated when the mass is not distributed evenly.
A number of things. * The chemical bonds between the atoms and molecules in the substance must release energy when they break. Some types of chemical bonds require you to put energy into them before they can break, and that’s usually bad for burning. * * * The substance must have at least one atom or molecule that is attracted to oxygen. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Photons have no rest mass, but that doesn't mean they have no mass (or, more precisely, energy) in the sense of special relativity. Mass and energy are just two aspects of the same thing (I'll refer to this thing as "energy" from now on, but in the context of special relativity, this "energy" is the thing that creates gravity). You might be familiar with the formula E=mc2, but that only applies to a particle at rest (which a proton is never at rest). The full formula is E2 = mc2 + pc2, where m is the rest mass (if any), c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum. For a photon, m=0. But photons do have momentum (p=h/h), so the energy and the mass of a photon aren't zero and they can be affected by gravity like anything else. Or to put it another way, since the energy of a photon isn't zero, its gravitational mass isn't zero. In other words, it's not just that photons feel gravity, they produce it themselves. Now the gravitational mass of a photon is so small that it's effectively negligible compared to any particle with a rest mass. A photon of visible light has an energy of about 0.44 x 10-19 J, while the rest mass-energy of an electron is about 0.08 x 10-14 J, which is 200,000 times larger. Moreover, this isn't the whole story. In special relativity, mass-energy isn't the only thing that creates gravitational fields. The fundamental source of gravitational fields, the stress-energy tensor, is also affected by the momentum of mass-energy.
No, it’s usually best to think of it as a kind of displacement. Then, there’s a certain amount of physical displacement from a more stable position which ‘stores’ energy until it is released. Imagine a spring which you have squeezed. Its metal atoms are displaced from their most stable arrangement, and there’s a strain on them from their own alternating electric and magnetic forces which are trying to restore their equilibrium. Now imagine a stone which you have lugged to the top of Everest; it is displaced several thousand metres from its equilibrium position in the gravity well of the Earth. A push from below immediately transforms its energy into kinetic energy. But if you put it back down, the repulsion between the rocks and their electrical charge will resist; but the potential to fall still exists.
It's either naive or dishonest, probably both. He thinks his reason is more powerful than what he sees, and that's wrong. There are infinitesimally many infinites (see Georg Cantor and set theory), but the important part is that they can be divided into convergent and divergent. Cauchy gave us a formula for determining whether a series converges or diverges. In short, an infinite series can converge to a finite number. To dismiss it as 'only a theory' is a form of minimization that no mathematician or physicist would allow to his field of study.
The people who testify that we did not know what we were doing are 100 percent wrong. People who made and tested atomic bombs from the 40s to the 60s knew that they would create toxic substances, that they would be released into the air and would inevitably end up in the environment, in the food chain, and in human bodies. They knew this even before they had tested the first bomb, it was an inevitable consequence of how the bomb works (splitting the atom, in turn, means generating highly radioactive products). So why did they do it? They thought — on the basis of very limited evidence — that, if they tested them far enough from people, when radioactive poisons got into the human food chain, they would be sufficiently diluted that they would not cause significant harm. But that does not mean that they did not do any harm. (It's a matter of opinion.) The only difference was that they were so small that it would be difficult to prove, and therefore it was the same as saying that it was not important. If you know that what you do will probably kill thousands of people in the future, but you do not know who they are, and that it will never be possible to prove that it is your fault, are you a murderer or not? This question is much deeper than it seems at first sight, because we do a lot of things today that we know will be bad for people, but where we are so far removed from the immediate consequences that we generally do not feel any responsibility. The uncertainty was how poisonous it was, and the people who tested the atomic bombs assumed that it would not be so bad, whereas we might say in hindsight that it might be worse until it was proven wrong. In any case, the risk of not having a good knowledge of the atomic bomb was much more dangerous than the danger of the danger of its tests. If it is a matter of a large-scale atomic test or a atomic war, the former is probably less harmful than the latter. That's how the people who made the atomic bomb saw the choice in the early cold war — whether they were right or not. (Not everyone thought so.) All this led to the logic that it was better to test, even if it was poisonous, than not to test. Over time, not everyone agreed with this reasoning. – Already in the early sixties, the amount of radioactivity in the air and in people's bodies from the tests had reached a size that could be measured (but not the health consequences of it, it's very easy to measure small doses, it's much harder to prove that they are dangerous). So it was so frightening that the US and the USSR, the two countries that tested the most bombs, agreed on a treaty that they would only test underground. That does not create radioactive poisons, if it is done properly. Some countries still tested in the air for a few years (France and China), because underground tests put a limit on the size of the test (it is difficult to test large bombs under ground, because it requires digging deep holes). But they finally signed up too. Today we know, based on careful studies from the sixties and later, that the atmospheric bombs affected the health of people in the immediate vicinity of the explosion ("downwinders"), and probably caused a small increase in cancer in the entire area of the tests (in the hemisphere as a whole), but even a very small increase in the number of deaths from cancer when you have a large number of people who are exposed adds up to a large number of people (tens of thousands of deaths from cancer). Even then it is difficult to prove that the cancer of the downwinders was caused by the tests, because cancer does not have a label saying what caused it, and several things can cause cancer, but if you look at groups of people, you can compare their cancer rate with the general population and find that there are sharp differences. But it is very difficult to estimate the increased cancer risk in the whole hemisphere, because even if there were a large number of additional cancers (maybe up to 100,000 over the whole twentieth century), it is compared to millions of other cancers that were occurring every year. So this is more theoretical.
Air pressure. Wind. When the outside air pressure is lower than the pressure inside, the air rushes out the window, and since the door is open, the air has a short path to travel, between the frame and the glass, and since the door is open, it carries air from outside into the room, and because the door is open, it carries the door along with it. Then the pressure equalizes somewhat, so the door closes. And it happens again. I’m used to it. I’m in the habit of leaving my window open, but I leave the door open, too.
I would travel until the universe ended. There is a bubble around us, called the Hubble volume, where space is currently expanding faster than light. This you could never leave, so even with infinite time you would never reach the edge of the universe, if such a thing exists. You would stay within the confines of the observable universe.
It isn't a single point. Gravity in orbit is almost as strong as on earth, but they and the ship they're in are moving together rather than the ship holding them up, and even if the ship were to disappear, the crew would still go around in the same orbit. Since they can't feel the weight of their bodies, it feels like weightlessness. When they slow down for reentry, they feel the deceleration of the ship, but except during the burn of the engines, they and the ship are still going together. Until they enter the atmosphere, when the ship decelerates and they don't because of air resistance, they can't feel the effects of gravity. However, if the ship gains speed, they feel the effects of gravity, but they have to experience it. For the space shuttle, this occurs near the end of the descent, when the air is thick enough to support the wings. For a rocket that lands without gliding (not in use for passenger transportation), they feel it during the burn of the engines to land.
Light is a form of energy; photons are particles of light, but since they are massless particles, they have momentum but no mass. Therefore light has no mass.
Here's an example. Say you have a choice between eating toast or cereal for breakfast. There are two alternate realities: the one where you eat the toast and the other where you eat the cereal. Now each of those alternate realities has its own associated alternate time lines, and the events in those alternate time lines are the things that happen because you eat the toast or the cereal. You might drop the cereal bowl while pouring the milk, which makes you late for work, and so on. The alternate time lines contain the past, present and future of the alternate realities, while the alternate realities are the present as it were.
Bah! it’s calculated. It’s built to scale. Steel beams, girders, structural members have a known volume and density. So also concrete which is poured; the makers know the dimensions of the work and the density of the material. They calculate the weight, it’s a matter of simple arithmetic. A standard material like plaster-board flooring has a standard weight per unit area. Glass for the windows can be calculated, also in terms of weight per unit area. When you are talking about thousands of tons, you don’t have to worry about a few pounds or ounces.
Almost all waterjets used to cut metals are mixed with abrasive material (basically sandpaper grits). They don't cut metals, but sand them down really fast. But that's basically just a lot of tiny cuts happening really fast. The waterjet is very high pressure (thousands of pounds per square inch). This is already higher than the yield strength of some softer materials, and waterjet can cut them by itself by pushing the material out of the way.
Normally if you accelerate you're pulled back into your seat. But for most of the flight the spaceship is not accelerating (that is, not nearly so much)—thus it is “falling” with the Astronauts inside. And for the vast majority of the time, the thrusters were off.
A. There is nothing to slow them down, and once they are launched they can go on going without fueling. There is no difficulty in launching a spacecraft; and once launched it can go on going indefinitely. B. Not all systems of spacecraft propulsion depend on combustion. To propel a spacecraft a propeller is needed. Energy is needed to propel a propeller. Combustion is a convenient method, because the result of combustion is both momentum and energy. And the combination makes a very good engine for propulsion in space. But there are other systems, which are better adapted to other circumstances. For example, it is possible to convert sunlight into electricity and then use that electricity to launch xenon atoms at incredible speeds. This is much more efficient and does not require oxygen. C. Spacecraft which depend on oxygen take it with them. This is merely another form of fuel. Tanks are required for oxygen (usually kept in a liquid state to save space), and for fuel. The fuel can be either kerosene or liquid hydrogen.
In Freud’s theory, Freud recognized three parts of the unconscious, which develop at different stages of childhood. The ego is a part that tries to mediate between the other two (superego and id) in order to prevent anxiety. It mediates by reason and prudence when it comes to desires and behavior, thinking about the expected consequences and making decisions based on them, and by doing so to find a decision that will be acceptable to all parts of the brain. The ego tries to find a decision when, for example, you find a wallet full of money, and the id wants to take it and use it, and the superego wants to give it to the police. This can lead to anxiety, and the ego asks questions such as: "Is anyone watching me? " How much money is there? How bad do I need it? " And similar questions that push the unconscious to the id or superego and that way to a decision. In other cases, where the situation is not so easily solved, the ego uses other coping strategies to deal with anxiety, such as repressing memories, transferring unacceptable feelings to acceptable objects, and finding the same unwanted desires in other people. These defensive tactics were, in Freud's opinion, very useful for the study of the unconscious of his patients.
A huge metal bird is not meant to smash into the ground. The soft human inside cannot endure such forces.
Watch what happens when you throw a stone into a pond. The waves move, expand and dissipate. Sounds are like that, you can't see them. But sound travels by putting its energy into a surface. And like water waves, sound cannot travel infinitely through a surface because it loses its energy on its way. The more dense the surface the more energy is taken out, like yelling into a pillow, which almost goes nowhere.
We can't, we just use lots of factors like composition, activity, temperature, etc. to "guess" what it might sound like.
it happens all the time because hydrogen is plentiful, and is continually struck by the photons flying around in space. The photon strikes the hydrogen, it excites an electron, which then de-excites and emits a photon, which is detected.
It is not natural for things to get cold when they are stretched out. It so happens that most gases do get cold under the conditions prevailing on earth, but that is no guarantee, and even on earth it is not universal (hydrogen and helium get warmer when they are stretched out at room temperature). The explanation of this cooling is a rather complicated one, and relates to the attractive and repulsive forces between the atoms. Atoms are repulsive near to each other and attractive at a distance, and the energy of a gas changes depending on whether its atoms are near or far apart. If they are mainly repulsive, then stretching out the gas changes the repulsive energy into the energy of motion, and so the gas gets warmer. If they are mainly in the attractive zone, then stretching out the gas makes the atoms move apart, which consumes energy and cools the gas. (Ideal gases have neither attractive nor repulsive forces, and they neither heat up nor cool down when they are stretched out, and so cooling is an example of the fact that real gases are not really ideal, even if they are a good model in many respects.) In practice, under normal conditions on earth, the atoms of gases are mostly in the attractive zone, and therefore they cool when they are stretched out.
The electric drive has no clutch or a pop. It can deliver a lot of power without the wheels slipping. It’s not so much about horsepower as the even power output from 0 to maximum RPM without the need for gears or shifts.
Time is the ability of the universe to be potential, to change its state or the state of anything of which it is composed.
Newton's second law of motion says: A force F on an object with mass m will cause an acceleration a. In other words, F = ma. So if you accept that F=gm and that g*m * a is equal to g*m*a, you are saying that a=g*m*a or simply a = g. In other words, if you remove the mass term you get: "gravity makes objects accelerate at 9.81 m/s"
It comes from the matter. E = mc2 is well known, which means that the masses of the particles are converted into pure energy.
Yes, it is a closed system, provided that the ship itself is a closed system. The difficult part is getting rid of the heat since the radiators cannot be cooled with air. Here's how it's actually done on the ISS:
The universe is expanding. Nothing can move faster than the speed of light, but the expansion of space is not constrained by the speed of light. During the early stages of the expansion, light from the apex of the universe was able to reach us, but now that part of the universe is much farther away from us and so the light that is now generated there will never reach us.
This is a navigational officer from a large company that operates seagoing ships. Some of the other answers are pure conjecture or just plain wrong, sorry to say. There are many things in concert that make it less likely they will topple over. The most important are the loading pattern, the ISO container, twist-locks, and lashings. The loading pattern: The heaviest containers are loaded in the lower half of the van. The upper one is usually empty, because of many reasons. (The top one is usually empty on the way to Asia, and going to Europe, it is usually empty because it is a refrigerator container.) There are also water ballast tanks that help lower the center of gravity. The center of gravity is the target value and is calculated by a complex program that uses the weight of the containers and other things. The ISO container: Today we mainly use 20', 40' and 45' containers. There are some other formats, mostly the 53' American rail, and a somewhat wider European van, but I don't know much about them. All containers built to the ISO standard have corners at exact points and sizes, and minimum strength. These are basically the most important points. When you look inside the ship, only 20' containers are stacked with the help of a cone stacker (or side-mounted stacker that is placed from the pier), before 40' containers are stacked on top of them. On deck, all are connected with twist-locks, to the container on top and bottom. There are different types of twist-locks, mainly the bottom one, which is wider at the bottom and therefore stronger. The rest are normally manual, semi-manual or automatic twist-locks. All of them basically work the same, but there is only one type on board the ship. The equipment is also part of the ship. Lashings: Lashings are usually placed between two layers of containers on most ships. On modern supermax ships, they are usually used on three levels. If you have had an accident and been able to investigate, you will usually find that it is either improperly or incorrectly lashed (with twist-locks in place), or the sender has given the wrong weights, so that a heavy container on top can be more easily tilted and turned. Maybe not ELI5 material, but feel free to ask follow-up questions. Edit: To all the good people who have given me the award: Thanks... Especially the gold medal!
Really we don’t know. But the general theory is that as an object accelerates, it requires more and more energy to continue accelerating. This is definitely true on Earth, and so far it seems to be true in a vacuum; the mathematics show that for an object with mass to reach the speed of light, an infinite amount of energy is required. As with all theoretical arguments involving infinity, it’s possible we’re wrong. However, experiments on sub-atomic particles in particle accelerators have never been able to reach the speed of light. They have been close — 99.99999999%—but each step closer requires much more energy. So, assuming that infinite energy is required, we say that travelling faster than light using only acceleration is impossible. However, it’s possible that a Star Trek or Futurama-style warp drive might be possible, where the space in front of the object is compressed. So that a spaceship travelling at less than light speed can cover more distance. This would get around the speed limit.
It is a way of formulating the flow principle, in particular in fluid mechanics. It is a notoriously difficult area of study, and it is not unusual for the first person to prove only one or two results before winning the million-dollar prize. Your friend is right to say that engineering is hard. But he's a dumb guy who gave the hardest possible answer.
Well, I'm no physicist, but I do know that air friction is at work around the puck, which is why it doesn't go on indefinitely.
The fan is spinning so fast that the refresh rate of your eyes has been exceeded. So, your eyes start to juggle the image going forward and backward, because they don't have enough information to stabilize it in one direction.
No it is not. The centrifugal acceleration is a1 / r2; the force is smaller when the circle is wider. A2 / r2   v2 / r2 = (r )2  r2  v2  r2  v2  r2  r2  v2  r2 So if you drive your car around a curve, the centrifugal force is smaller when the radius increases, but on a merry-go-round the centrifugal force is greater at the outer edge. The outer parts of the merry-go-round are moving much faster!
What you call "electromotive force" is an old-fashioned concept from the time when we thought electricity was some kind of liquid and supposedly this force was supposed to push the liquid through the wires. Today we still call the emf in circuits "electromotive force," not because it's actually a force, but because it's conventional. Electromotive force is the potential energy that a charged particle would lose if it went from one side of the circuit to the other. It is also called "voltage. " This emf is measured in units of energy per charge, such as volts, joules per coulomb, etc. (In principle, there is a difference between emf and voltage, but for most practical purposes and for the purpose of this explanation, they are almost the same.) The emf, on the other hand, is the force that separates magnets and pulls the hair off your head when you rub balloons together. It is the real force (in newtons or pounds, if you don't want to use metric) that acts on magnets and charged particles. And it is the emf that creates the emf in the circuit. An electric particle moving in the direction of the emf will lose its emf and its voltage will change, which is called the emf in the circuit. * In the last section I said that you measure the emf in joules, which is obviously wrong. You measure it in volts. I've corrected it.
Black holes and neutron stars are, to begin with, both massive atomic phenomena. But we don't know enough about these objects to be able to test the unknown. In essence, quantum mechanics is the best tested theory we have.
I want you to imagine you are trying to colour all the water in a hosepipe. The colour would only get into the water at the end, but it would never get up the hosepipe. That’s what happens with fire.
If you close the window halfway, half the energy of the sound waves will enter the reverberant room. An accurate meter would reveal this. And it doesn’t seem half as loud? The human brain is a completely nonlinear processing system. The purpose of hearing is to pick up small noises that might warn you of danger. This is the same as amplification with a preamplifier. It turns the sound up and you can still hear the music.
Who's so excited? Most of the people I talked to thought it was just a waste of resources for some useless entertainment.
The earth is constantly falling toward the sun, but at the same time it is also moving sideways very, very fast, so that it is always able to miss the sun by flying past it. That's the way it works with all gravitational orbits. If our planet's motion to the side were suddenly to stop, it would just fall straight into the sun, but since it is moving sideways at a speed that is nearly constant, it never actually hits the sun. A good illustration of how the orbit works can be found here. If you stand on a high tower and fire a gun, the bullet will fly forward but it will be pulled back by gravity and it will hit the ground. If you fire a bigger gun, the bullet will go faster and fall further before gravity brings it back down. If you fire a still bigger gun, the bullet will go even faster and go around the earth before being brought back down by gravity. The earth is that bullet, it is falling toward the sun and moving sideways at a speed that is so great that it always flies past the sun.
Light is a wave traveling through the electric and magnetic fields. When the frequency of that wave changes, the color changes. It is exactly the same as with sound: If the frequency increases, the pitch goes up and the color of light goes to blue; if the frequency decreases, the pitch goes down and the color goes to red. The frequency of a wave is the number of cycles per second.
Light moves with a fixed speed in a vacuum, but in a dense medium such as the atmosphere of the earth it is a little deflected by the interaction with matter. They know the speed of light by going backwards. The speed of light is defined by Einstein's theory of special relativity, and this limit is precisely 186,223, which is a mouthful, so it is called c. But the trouble is that nothing that has mass can reach this speed, so c is only a theoretical speed that no object can achieve. Light has no mass and can reach this speed in a vacuum, so light speed is c. If you multiply c by 3,154,000 (the number of seconds in a year) you get a very big and ugly number of meters, and we call it 1 light year.
In the process of developing the atomic bomb, the main effort was in making the explosive material for the bomb. It is not enough to use ordinary uranium, but to build large atomic factories to get a high content of the rare isotope uranium-235. This is about 60% of the total effort and money spent on the project, but it only makes one bomb material. Then it's easy to make a uranium bomb. It's a little harder than you think, because it must be almost certain that it will work, so it needs a lot of research on what exactly will produce an atomic explosion, and the exact reason why this design works exactly as they expect. But it's not very complicated, and most of the work during the war is not that. Because of the uncertain smelting of uranium-235, it is also necessary to make a different explosive material, plutonium-239, which is an artificial element, and must be made in a large number of atomic machines. This is about 40% of the effort, but only for this plutonium-239 material. But in the process, it was discovered that plutonium-239 can't be used as a gun-type explosive like uranium-235, but it starts reacting too early and doesn't work. So most of the time was spent on a much more complicated design that can be used with plutonium-239, a fusion bomb. First of all, the first bombs are fission, not fusion. And it's not a violent collision that makes the reaction work, but the reaction is because these special reagents (called fissile materials) are in the right state, and a chain reaction occurs. The design must avoid the reaction of these materials until the time of the bomb explosion, and this is a very fast transition from "not going to react" to "going to react". Therefore, the gun-type explosive is to take two non-reactive substances of uranium-235, and quickly hit them together. Then the fusion bomb is to take a non-reactive substance of plutonium-239, and use a high explosive to increase the density to make it a reactive substance (three important (but not only) things in the state of the fissile material are whether it will react or not, and the important thing is whether it is going to react or not). ). Compared with that, about 4% of the total work on the atom bomb design. But why do you say that the main story is a bomb design and not a factory making explosives? It is mostly because it is more fun to tell a story about a smart man than to tell a story about a large factory.
A leaf-blower puts air in the sail, but the blower is also pushed back by a counter-force. So, as long as the blower is connected to the boat, the two forces cancel each other out, and you can't move. Of course, this means that if the blower isn't connected to the boat (for example, it's being held by someone on the shore), it'll work. But a hot air balloon doesn't blow air to create a force. It heats the air with a flame. Then the hot air spreads out, becomes less dense, and produces buoyancy in the balloon.
The two biggest factors are wind chill and relative humidity. The more wind there is, the colder the air feels, because the wind is blowing away the air that is warmed up by your body and instead bringing in fresh, cold air. A small wind can be refreshing, a strong wind much colder than you might expect. Higher humidity makes it feel warmer because it makes you sweat less. Extreme humidity will feel muggy and heavy.
Yes. Take the United States’ missile defence system. In the first line of defence you have Aegis missile cruisers. If they are strategically and fortunately placed, they can take a shot at a launching ballistic missile. The next line of defence is the Ground-based Midcourse Defence System (or GMD). This is a large missile system that launches an interceptor missile to try and intercept an incoming reentry vehicle in its suborbital phase. Next you have the Terminal High Altitude Air Defence system (or THAAD). It can hit the reentry vehicle in its terminal phase. Then there are systems like the Patriot missile. It can try and hit a separate reentry vehicle, but this is a random affair.
Your faucet has an aerator that mixes air bubbles with the water stream. The aerator can only work properly when the water stream is high enough to saturate it, adding bubbles that scatter light and make the water white. The bubbly water is less likely to splash than the untreated water, and the increased turbulence makes the water flow feel greater.
The ideal gas law: P V = nRT The ideal gas law is a theoretical formula; it can be altered in practice by certain factors, but for the sake of the ELI5 method, it means that the product of the pressure (P) and volume (V) is always equal to the product of the amount of gas (n), the temperature (T), and a fixed constant (R). This equation always holds. From this it can be seen that if we want to increase the pressure, there are three things we can do: increase the amount of gas (increase n), increase the temperature (increase T), or decrease the volume (decrease V). Any one of these three changes will balance the equation so that it still holds with the increased pressure. If we want to increase the pressure and maintain the volume and the amount of gas, we must increase the temperature.
The dimension of a space is nothing more than the minimum number of coordinates which is required to define a point exactly in that space. Take a line, for instance. A line is one-dimensional because it takes only one coordinate to specify a point in it. A plane square, such as a piece of paper, is two-dimensional because it takes two coordinates to specify a point on it: namely, the left-right and the up-down. A cube is three-dimensional because it takes three coordinates: the up-down, the left-right, and the back-front. But time also is a dimension, because time is inextricably linked with space, and to know where something is in space one also has to know at what point in time it is located. We know that there are at least three dimensions in space because we need three coordinates to specify the location of anything in space: the left-right, the up-down, and the back-front. There cannot be fewer than two dimensions, because we can see that things have a length, breadth, and height. There could be more, and some theories posit that there are many more hidden dimensions of space than the three that we see, but there is no proof that they exist, and there is certainly no proof that there are infinite dimensions, even though one can mathematically model them. As for why color or temperature are not dimensions, it is because they are just attributes of things, they do not tell you the location of anything in space.
If you're talking about sport climbing, someone goes on top of the cliff and finds a line that can be climbed. They put a few permanent slings into the rock as a kind of checkpoint, where the rope is tied and where they are caught in case of a fall.
Metals have free circulating electrons in their surface layers, so they conduct electricity easily, and a small difference in potential, or in the field of an electric field, can start the movement of these free circulating electrons, and the movement of these free circulating electrons is electricity. So the phenomenon of electricity caused by the occurrence of an electric field is called acousto-magnetic induction. This is the reason why radios work, why it is possible to put a circulating electric potential on an antenna and all metals within range will feel it (a corresponding circulating current will appear in them), and why transformers work. So your pulsar gives off a very strong radio frequency field. Since all the atoms in an electrical device are connected by wires, your pulsar will induce a strong and very chaotic current in all these wires, and this will burn out the atoms in all the components. You don't need a pulsar at all: electrical devices are ruined by the radiation from a microwave oven, by the radiation from a powerful transmitter antenna, by the radiation of the sun's flares, etc.
Fundamentally, a moving electric field—that is, a moving electric charge in a conductor—produces a magnetic field. And a magnetic field in turn generates an electric field. An electric charge always creates an electric field. Usually we describe how a single moving charge interacts with the stationary charges in our reference frame. That’s why we can speak of the magnetic field of a moving charge. But you could pick any frame of reference you like, and the effect would still be the same, so the important thing is the motion of the two charges relative to each other.
Water wants to stick to everything (that’s why it runs down your arm in the shower). The shape of a pourer is designed so that water can’t stick to it. Without a pourer, you have to hold the cup almost upside down, so that it doesn’t stick to the glass as it does in the shower.
magnetic bearings are very low-friction, but not no-friction. The moving magnetic field causes eddy currents in surrounding parts. And if one uses electric magnets as in maglev, then one has to superconduct in order to avoid heat losses.
You can't measure the interval between the gravity waves. Gravity doesn't travel as waves, gravity just is. When two heavy objects are in motion, they can increase the gravity along a line through the center of mass of both objects, and since they are rotating, they produce a gravitational wave that spirals outward at the speed of light. The closer they are and the faster they go, the more frequently we can measure these gravitational waves, until they approach each other, converge, and become one body.
General relativity is an application of geometry, the study of forms and surfaces. The four-dimensional surface used in general relativity is called spacetime, and it is the curvature of this surface that allows us to make practical predictions about gravity. But just as your textbook on magnetism doesn't say that a magnet shoots out arrows, so general relativity doesn't say that we actually live on a surface called spacetime and that it curves under the action of mass or energy. So no, matter does not displace spacetime because spacetime doesn't exist.
Mechanical advantage. Energy may be constant, but force is not. A small force is applied to the lever, which is moved a long way, and, in return, the vehicle is moved a short way by an enormous force.
In general, a liquid’s power of dissolving a substance depends on how quickly and completely the molecules of the solvent can surround the particles of the substance. When water or other liquids become warmer, the molecules have more energy, so they can take hold of the particles faster and more completely. It is a question of the motion of the particles, rather than of the space between them, for the volume of a liquid does not much change with the change of temperature.
ISS does not stand still. Clocks in ISS would run slower because of time dilation. There is also a difference in speed because of the opposite direction of gravity, but this is countered by the speed.
There is a lack of traction on the road. The rain washes the oil on the road to the top. Then a car skids and crashes into a pole. Then, when it's windy, a branch or a tree fall on the line. Rain does not cause a power failure, damage to the grid does.
It’s nothing. Except for some gas, rocks, dust, and radiation. You know how the atmosphere gets rarer and rarer the higher you go? Well, there you can’t find many gas molecules, and there’s nothing to take their place. So what’s left is nothing.
Let’s work it out! The brightness of a star is proportional to 1/distance. The sun illuminates the earth with a power of 1 kilowatt per square meter. The healthy human pupil when fully dilated has a diameter of about a centimeter. Therefore, when looking at the sun through a dilated pupil, aside from the pain, one lets in about 270 watts. If the sun were 10 light-years away, it would be as bright as a faint star. So to calculate the power falling on the eye from a faint star, we must divide 270 watts / (the distance of the sun in parsecs / the distance to the sun)2 =.06 x 10-14 watts. We only need to multiply by the average energy of a visible light particle, which is about 10-19 joule. We thus get a rough figure of a hundred and sixty thousand photons per second. But this is a long way above the threshold of perception, which is reached at about a hundred photons. It is the ambient light in the atmosphere, and not the darkness that limits our vision, that limits our perception of a star. A closed room is darker than the night. [ed. sorry, I was using the raw sun-power in space, only 1 kilowatt per square meter makes it to the ground, so my figure is a bit on the high side. However, there are other errors involved.]
The universe is expanding and it seems to be accelerating. This is a phenomenon that cannot be explained, it is attributed to the unknown dark energy, or even perhaps to dark matter. The heat result is very interesting, it may be a manifestation of the dark energy, and in the future someone will be able to combine both accelerating expansion and rising temperature into a single theory. Then, that answer will be worth a Nobel prize.
Diamonds aren't *really* heat resistant, not more than a decent steel. They start turning into vapor at a temperature of about 1,000° C. When it comes to heat resistance, we normally rely on tungsten.
If your phone falls, the screen protector takes the damage. In other words, it's the same principle as wearing a helmet. Does he believe in helmets?
- Because the transition from liquid to vapor is not what burns. Hot water burns. The boiling water is hot. It burns. Reduce the degree of boiling by one, and it no longer burns as much. Water that turns into vapor is not hot. The energy necessary for a molecule to jump from water into the air is not enough to damage the body. When the water is so hot that the molecules are thrown off with such force that they displace all the air around them, then there is enough to do damage.
You're right. An electrically resistive space heater is 100 % efficient in converting electricity into heat. (Even the small part of the energy that turns into light reflects off the walls and back into the room as heat.) The small ones might have a hard time spreading the heat around, but if they put out the same amount of watts, they put out the same amount of heat.
it is not a gas like the one that burns on the hearth; it is a fusion, the conversion of hydrogen into helium, but this hydrogen is being consumed. The sun will therefore be exhausted in a few billion years. You underestimate the sun's colossal size and the quantity of hydrogen still in it.
Very large nuclei are highly unstable. They are created by smashing together small nuclei, and after a very short time they decay into even smaller nuclei.
It is because a bicycle is a dynamically stable machine. Any change in the angle of the front wheel makes the whole frame lean toward the angle and straightens up. Try it out. Stand next to a stationary bike and hold it by the seat. Then lean it and watch the handlebars. You will see the effect immediately. In motion the handlebars are twisted a little and that is enough to correct the small angle. It is like holding a stick upright on your finger. If the stick starts to fall you shift your finger “in front” of the fall to keep it up. The bicycle does something similar while it is moving. But when it stops, it falls down, just like a stick that you have stopped moving.
Humphry Davy, a famous British chemist and inventor, had experimented 200 years before Thomas Alva Edison with electricity and light. He discovered that if a wire carries a current, it heats up and gives off light. The trouble was, Davy could not find any substance that would give off light brightly, burn for a long time and not cost a fortune. In 1839, before Edison, a man named Warren De La Rue solved the scientific problem of how to make a light bulb burn brightly and last a long time. He used very thin high resistance wires, which he enclosed in a vacuum-packed glass envelope made of a metal with a high melting point. De La Rue used very expensive platinum wires, and he could not maintain a proper vacuum, which made the device too expensive for general use. His light bulbs quickly went out. Then, Edison used a thin carbon wire, and invented a better vacuum system, so people think he invented the lightbulb. But when Westinghouse got the contract to light the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago, they could not use the screw-in sockets Edison had invented, so a new socket was invented with a twist-on cap.
As you have pointed out, when there is no load connected it is very easy to turn the machine. Consequently you haven’t expended much energy in making it turn, so there isn’t much energy to go somewhere. And what little energy you do expend, goes to friction in the bearings, and maybe a little joule heat from eddy currents.
It's all a matter of resistance, and power is lost on the way. They can reduce this loss by using bigger wires and higher voltages, which lowers the current carrying the same power. But even so, about 5 percent of the electricity generated in the United States is lost in the transmission lines. That's why you need many power stations instead of feeding the world from a single solar farm in the desert.
It’s always looking back in time. Light travels 300 million meters per second. That’s a ridiculously fast speed. But it’s not instantaneous. If you stand a meter and a half away from a mirror and look at your reflection, the light has to travel three meters before it reaches your eye. It has to go from your body to the mirror, then back to your eye. It takes about 10 nanoseconds, or 10 millionths of a second, to reach you, which is 0.00000001 of a second. So you’re looking at yourself as you were 0.00000001 of a second ago. For practical purposes, however, you can think of it as instantaneous. Space is vast. It’s beyond comprehension. Even at light speed, it takes eight minutes for the sun’s light to reach us. When you look at the sun (please don’t do this), you’re seeing light that left eight minutes ago. If the sun suddenly disappeared, we wouldn’t notice for eight minutes. But that’s just our own star. Proxima Centauri, the nearest star, is so far away that it takes four years for its light to reach us. So when we point a telescope at it, or just our eyes, we’re seeing light that left the star four years ago. We’re literally looking at the universe in the past. Because the universe is so huge, they had to come up with a new measure of distance, the light-year. This is the distance light can travel in a year, which is about 10 trillion meters. The Andromeda galaxy is our nearest neighboring galaxy. It’s about 2 million light-years away. This means that when we point a telescope at it, we see light that left the galaxy 2 million years ago, and that’s been traveling at 300 million meters per second for all that time. This is what it means when we say a telescope can see back in time. The light has traveled so far that it’s taken that long to reach us!
It is a process which takes place without the object undergoing any change in temperature, and is accompanied by a change in pressure and volume. The Boyle law is:
How do you suppose the pieces are coming towards you? You see them flying in all directions, do you not?
Just like a waterfall is just a river with a sharp drop in it, it does not run out of water because there is enough water upstream (typically the melt from snow) to keep it supplied. But like any river, under the right circumstances, it can run dry.
In either case the result would be the same. Except the cool air would “penetrate” your home through every crack. And if you have a good climate control system, it would have both of them (connected, in a heat exchanger, to a radiator for heat recovery in winter).
It is not true that mirrors ever flip reflections. Or rather one could say that they flip front-back since your image is facing you, but not left-right. We expect them to flip left-right since a person facing us has to turn to the right. That is why they are confusing.
[Footnote 1: A certain downward motion does not affect your weight. For example, when I go down in the elevator, after the initial acceleration, I don't feel any different. Your weight is not affected by your speed (in whatever direction you are moving), but only by your speed, that is, your speed, and your weight (and a few other things, like your position in the gravitational field, and the buoyancy of the liquid you are in, but I don't think that's what you are asking).
It's probably magic. Like the other three forces of nature, gravity, strong and weak. But we don't really know why it works. It just works. Anyone who develops a theory would probably get the physics nobel prize and a ridiculous amount of money.
Gravity also pulls down other objects, such as air, which is heavier than the cloud. The cloud is heavy, but the air beneath it, which it would displace if it were to fall, is even heavier. But the feather is small, and the air it would displace is small, and so the weight of the feather overcomes the weight of the air it would displace.
Very simple. The mass-less photon is an extraordinary entity; it has no rest mass and only exists at high velocity; it is a particle with angular momentum, although it has neither mass nor width; it is the antiparticle of itself, for antimatter processes produce photons identical with those produced by the regular matter processes.
You're talking about the shockwaves from explosions? The shockwave is essentially a whole lot of air molecules knocking each other over and carrying the kinetic energy to the next air molecules. The pusher of the first domino is the explosion.
True vacuum is an arbitrary term since matter and energy are interchangeable in E=mc2. You can’t create space that has no energy. Space itself is charged with energy in the realm of quantum mechanics.
We both measure the same speed; the difference between us appears in the frequency, which, as we approach the source, moves up to higher values (the blue shift) and as we move away from the source, it moves down (the red shift). There is no such thing as a stationary observer, but you must mean one who is stationary with respect to the source. This is why we both measure the same speed, because the speed of time varies with our relative motion. We have a light source at A, a stationary observer at B with respect to A, and ourselves moving towards A (with respect to both A and B). Because we are moving relative to B, the speed of time elapses for us more slowly than for B. When all the dust has settled, we both measure exactly the same speed.
V = IR Where: V=volts, R=resistance, I=amps, R=resistance x current.
The first known calculation was made by Eratosthenes in about 240 BC. The dates of solstices and midsummer had been known for a thousand years or more. Eratosthenes went and found out where the sun's rays illumined the bottom of a well on midsummer's day at a place on the equator. He then verified the length of a shadow cast by a vertical pole on that day, some three hundred miles away. These two observations, combined with his knowledge of the distances between the two points, and the fact that the rays from the sun were vertical in one and inclined in the other, enabled him to calculate the diameter of the earth. This calculation was within the errors of measurement.
Nuclear research, as you might expect from the name. They are most famous for creating the World-Wide-Web (not the Internet), and for having built the Large Hadron Collider, which confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson, nicknamed the god particle. Well, yes. They do a lot of research. This ranges from the enormous speed and energy at which they smash particles together, to how to improve the World-Wide-Web.
The wind is neither hot nor cold. But it can reduce the pressure. When that happens, the humidity on the skin evaporates quicker. That’s because in lower pressure, the fast-moving molecules evaporate first and leave the slower ones behind. So the average temperature of the humidity is lowered and so is the temperature of the skin. Even in the absence of wind, this evaporation takes place. But with wind, it happens at a distinctly lower temperature. And that’s why wind seems cold.
Our eyes perceive flickering light as a constant light if it is below the flicker fusion threshold. A camera doesn't have this problem because a typical camera shutter speed is 1/60th of a second, which is more than enough to distinguish individual pulses.
It is a chemical property, namely the temperature at which a substance reacts with air. All chemistry is a special case of physics, and the chemical reactions are accomplished by the physical properties of the electrons.
It travels at its own velocity with respect to you. Consequently, its velocity with respect to the earth is the same, plus the speed of the train, since it was already moving at the speed of the train inside your gun.
Depending on the definition of fan, a turbopump could lower the pressure in an enclosed space to about 10 – 13 of an atmosphere.
Certain pairs of properties of a particle or system cannot be known with arbitrary accuracy simultaneously. This is not a technological problem—we don't need new technology to resolve it—nor is it even a physics problem—we need better representations of nature. This is more fundamental. The simplest example is the position and the speed of a particle. Speed is defined as the rate at which position changes. So if you want to know the speed of a particle with arbitrary accuracy, you have to know its position with arbitrary accuracy for a short time. So when we want to know the speed, we have to make the position approximate because it changes with time. On the other hand, if we want to know the position exactly, we have to know exactly at what time. Essentially, we cannot determine the speed. Speed is spread over space and time, position is a point. We can't have both. But we can choose the uncertainty of one, we can have both. For example, the particle will be at that point and at that speed during the time it is there. The other example is the position and the frequency of the wave. The wave is by definition extended in space. A single-frequency wave has infinite extension and no position. But if you add several frequencies, they will interfere to produce a more limited space-time. But the more accurate the position, the more waves you have to add. So we can't know them with arbitrary accuracy. Whenever this kind of interaction occurs, it is the Heisenberg principle.
Light can be polarized as well as being ultra-violet. They are not two separate things, but two different labels which designate different properties of the same light. Light is composed of a wavy electric and magnetic field, just like the waves in a puddle when a stone is dropped in it, or a wavy string, with a strong field where the string is high, and a reverse field where the string is low. This field vibrates up and down as light travels. The faster the vibration, the higher the frequency, and this frequency determines the color of light. Red light, for instance, has a lower frequency than blue light, and radio waves, which are light as well, have a lower frequency still. Hence, we have certain light-waves that we cannot see. Violet is the highest-colored light that we can see, and ultra-violet has a higher frequency, so we can't see it. So ultra-violet light means light with a certain frequency, or speed of vibration. Since light also has a direction of vibration, we can also speak of the direction of its vibration: up and down, or sideways, or intermediate between the two. This direction of its vibration is called its polarization. Most light, such as sunlight, is composed of waves with all directions, so it is not polarized. On the other hand, when the light all has the same direction of vibration, we call it polarized light.
If you are referring to a filter that has a narrow band, you would see no patch of light on the blue wall. If you are referring to a strip of wall, a patch of blue will appear.
The sound we hear is the result of vibrations in the air. But the vibrations can also travel through a solid object such as a wall, and they can still vibrate the air enough for us to hear them. When you hear someone talking in a room across the way, you can hear that the voice has changed because the vibrations are moving through the wall differently.
They don’t. They don’t even know if it’s finite or infinite. All they know is that it’s much bigger than the observable universe, because they can see stars that are beyond the observable universe, and can calculate their distance from us as about four times the radius of the observable universe (I don’t have the figures to hand, but I think it’s something like that).
: A conscious observer is essentially unimportant. The word measurement is often misleading in quantum mechanics; a better word would be interaction. You can only measure something if you let it interact. In the double-slit experiment, for example, you can't have a photon go through the two slits and be detected without the photon affecting the detector in some way and thus decohering the wave.
It depends on how many ‘free’ or ‘electronic’ atoms are in the material. When visible light hits the material, the free-moving atoms can absorb the energy and re-emit it in a different direction. Metals are shiny and opaque because they have free-moving atoms which can respond to light. But glass has no free-moving atoms, so the light doesn’t have enough energy to do anything with it and just passes through.
We don't know. All we know is that all matter and all energy, even time and space itself, came into being at the moment of the big bang. The how and the why are still a mystery to science.
We predicted them long before there was any evidence they existed, or could even exist. Theoretically, in Einstein's general theory of relativity, it was found that if something is dense enough, it will collapse indefinitely and reach a point from which not even light can escape. Subsequently, a number of radio sources were discovered whose properties were very similar to those of a black hole.
It is said that the relationship between the wavelength and the frequency of all waves is determined by the speed. Two waves of the same length can travel at different speeds, the one that travels faster is the one with the higher frequency. Speed is the distance per unit time, frequency is the number of turns per unit time, and wavelength is the length. Wavelength * frequency = speed. The speed of the wave is constant for the radiation, the speed of light. Therefore, the frequency is determined by the wavelength. The longer the wavelength, the lower the frequency. Red light, 700nm wavelength, 4.29*1014.hz frequency. You know? That's how it is.
Before that time, there were very vague ideas in physics about the relationship between matter and energy. They were considered two different things. This equation demonstrated that everything is energy. Then it established the relation between them in a way that explained fusion, fission, and radioactivity. In practical terms, it explained radioactivity, as well as why the orbit of Mercury was not predictable by Newtonian physics. Consequently, it also explained why we understand the universe in a different way.
They fly through the air; if the air is moving, then they have to adjust themselves to the medium through which they are flying. The same is true for airplanes and boats in the water. It's the first problem in trigonometry to calculate the direction and speed to go to offset the speed and direction of the wind. Most of the time, the birds have enough power to counteract the wind and go in the direction they want. If the wind is too strong and they can't fly fast enough to counter it, they can't fly in such conditions.
We usually measure relative rather than absolute amounts, taking it for granted that there is no daughter in the original formation of the rock. For example, if we are measuring lead-uranium dating, we can choose a mineral that will reject lead during the formation of the crystal, so there will be no lead in the crystal during its formation. There might be some uranium, however. Later, the uranium can decay to lead and remain in the crystal, which we can then measure. Having knowledge that the lead that we see was originally uranium, we can calculate how long it took the uranium to decay to lead in the amount we see.
During the course of the storm, ice crystals and other particles inside the clouds collide with each other. Some particles acquire a positive charge and some particles a negative charge. Since the positive particles are carried upward, the negative particles gather in the lower part of the cloud, which is the side that touches the ground. The negatively charged bottom of the cloud repels the negative charges of the earth. The earth below the storm thus loses its negative charge and acquires a positive charge. Thus the bottom of the cloud becomes negatively charged and the ground beneath becomes positively charged. In order to restore the balance, lightning jumps from one to the other.
Not at all. It is more powerful in a small area but doesn't have enough strength to affect the Earth. It's just like a small flame, which is much hotter than an ocean, but doesn't heat the ocean. The scientific explanation is as follows: The magnetic field is a local value. It tells us how much force is there, but it doesn't tell us how much energy is there. The Earth's magnetic field is weak locally but very large.
You mean analogy (this is not restricted to physics), it is the notion that, lacking data in reality, we can argue that X is true by proving that: a) X resembles Y in important ways, b) Y is true, based on data we do have, c) the ways X is not like Y are not relevant to b) , d) therefore X is true. For example, you could say you haven't observed whether your apartment building would fall if a kitchen were to catch fire. But you have examples of other apartment buildings of similar size, similar building material and construction, built to similar standards, which have had kitchen fires and not fallen. So you can deduce with good probability that your apartment building would not fall from a kitchen fire. The difficult part is proving c) above. A dog and a cat resemble each other in many ways, and in many situations the differences between them are not relevant, they both need oxygen, both need milk for their young, etc., but in some situations the differences will be extremely important, like the chances of survival when thrown out of a window (in a kitchen fire, perhaps), so you really have to explain why the differences aren't relevant.
The one-way speed of light?
The tuna itself does not. Depending on the process, water ice may form on the tuna, increasing its weight.
They use a magnetic field to set the iron particles in the pan vibrating, which heats them up. The stovetop itself gets hot only when the pan is on it, and cools quickly when you lift it off.
Energy comes in a great many different forms, such as mechanical energy, heat, and light. And the way it interacts with matter depends on the type of energy and the type of matter, because the different kinds of matter respond differently to the different kinds of energy.
It's possible that the Universe is infinite, but there is still some doubt because of observation. We only see the part of the universe that is visible to us, but we are sure that the Universe is greater. The universe is expanding because the space between every object in the universe is increasing. The space between an atom's nucleus and its electrons theoretically increases, but the electrostatic attraction keeps the atom in its place. The result is that the space between the stars and the planets gets bigger.
The L2 point is a semi-stable point in the Sun-Earth system where the combined gravitational pulls of the two bodies will hold an object in place. It’s semi-stable in that it is stable in some directions but not in others. You can be a little off-point and orbit naturally, but only in some directions. Imagine a marble on a saddle. If the marble rolls forward or backward, the saddle will roll it back the way it came. The James Webb orbit is like a marble rolling back and forth on the saddle. But if the marble were to roll off the saddle to the left or right, the saddle would roll it off in that direction. So James Webb has to carefully keep its distance from the Sun or it will be dragged away from L2. That’s why it has maneuvering thrusters that must be fired from time to time, and they will eventually run out of fuel. The L4 and L5 points are in fact stable. Objects can be placed there and kept in place with little or no fuel. But they are much farther from the Sun than L2.
Salt water is denser than fresh water. Since floating is proportional to the weight of the body that displaces the liquid, in a denser fluid you displace less water for a given weight, and therefore float higher and easier.
Other people are unable to answer. What we have here is a machine that converts the air that the musician breathes out of his mouth into a vibrating air that we sense as sound. And really, sound does not take much energy. A wind instrument will, for instance, release only a millionth of a watt in the form of sound, which is very little compared to the kinetic energy of the air that is blown out of the mouth. So by converting only a little of the air’s energy into sound, you can make a great sound.
It’s because AC takes moisture out of the air and makes it colder. That’s why it feels different than the dry air outside. When there’s a lot of water vapor in the air, it feels different on our skin. Water likes to stick to things.
But we are here speaking of the light as a wave. If light is a wave, then its field is disturbed by the jostling of the charge particles. Light, being an oscillation of the electromagnetic field, also entrains the charged particles in the surrounding medium and thus undergoes retardation. Similarly, photons are also disturbed by the medium, when they meet more particles (say, more charged particles like the electrons) and the particles, in turn, are disturbed by the light wave, which also sets up a disturbance which, in turn, may set up a disturbance which in turn may set up a disturbance which disturbs the original wave and retards it (or may even cause it to speed up in some circumstances). The photons enter the optically denser medium and exit at the opposite side. In between, according to the rules of quantum mechanics, the light traverses through all the possible paths between the two points. Each path may have its own phase. The total time required for the photon to traverse the medium is the average of the time taken by the light on all the paths, with their own phases. It will be slightly longer than the actual time taken by the light to traverse the medium.
Basically, it's a complicated explanation that can't be summed up in a simple sentence: the universe does not expand at the speed of light, it moves faster, and the farther it moves, the further things move away from us. So, while no galaxy is older than the universe, it is more distant in light years than the universe is old.
An explosion is a sudden release of energy, and the release of energy is called a shock wave. This shock wave compresses the air in front of it, which then expands in front of the shock wave. If this compressed air hits the human body, it can cause serious damage to our soft insides, even if we don't have any shrapnel.
It is very important if the students can see the hall in front of them. This is called supersonic or subsonic. When you can see (subsonic) you react to what's ahead of you. If the hall is narrowing you speed up because the hall is getting smaller and if you slow down you get run over by the ones behind you. If the hall is widening, you slow down because there is more space. But when you don't know what's ahead of you, you can't do anything about it, that's supersonic. The “ahead” can’t influence your movements because you can’t see it. The rule is that the converging always drives you to Mach 1 (the speed of sound, the sonic flow). But the flow can't be converging indefinitely. It will “squeeze” at a certain point and there can be no more gas with the temperature and pressure that the incoming gas has. So, at the narrowest point you are subsonic or sonic, and if you want to accelerate supersonic past that, you must diverge. Above all, you don't add or subtract heat from the flow. If you do that (with a hot tube, with combustion in the tube, etc.), it gets even weirder.
As it takes time for water to come out of a hose and hit the ground. The light from the Sun is always streaming down, but if you were to follow one ray of light, it would take 8 minutes to travel from the sun to the earth.
- let's imagine a carousel. If we look at it when it's turning, you see a very different effect than when it's standing still. It's clearly pushing people against the walls, that's the centrifugal force. It manifests itself because their inertia wants to keep them moving in a straight line, but the wall catches them and pushes them inward. It's a fictitious force when you look at a non-rotating reference frame, but in a rotating reference frame it's quite real. The centripetal force is an inwardly directed force. It's actually the normal force of the wall, but for a rotating reference frame, looking and talking about centripetal and centrifugal forces is more intuitive. The Coriolis effect comes from the movement of something in a rotating frame, observed by a rotating observer. If someone on the wall takes a ball and throws it straight into the center, the ball seems to curve from the perspective of that person, because the person is still spinning. In reality, the ball has left the rotating frame and has entered a non-rotating frame, and from the perspective of the ball, it goes straight to the center of the carousel, it is the people on the wall that move.
"Just gone" and "smashed into a fine paste of indistinguishable biological matter" are pretty much the same thing. A building fell on people. If a slab of concrete falls on a body, there might not be much left to find.
The Big Bang did not happen in one place, as if everything had then expanded from that point. It happened everywhere. If you go one billion light years to the left, that’s where the Big Bang took place. And if you go one billion light years to the right, the same thing happened there. And if you look at the place where you are, the same thing happened there. It’s difficult to explain, but we have the best idea that space itself is infinite. So if you were to travel fourteen billion years to the furthest galaxy you can see and, when you got there, you looked back the way you came, you would still see galaxies fourteen billion light years away. And if you went in that direction, you would see even more. Imagine the infinite number line from minus infinity to plus infinity. So where’s the center? Zero, you might say. But the center could be any number on that line. If you pick a number—say, one hundred—you find infinitely many numbers smaller than one hundred and infinitely many bigger than one hundred. If you pick a negative number, there are infinitely many smaller than one billion and infinitely many larger than one billion. So from any point in the universe we can look in any direction and see the echo of the Big Bang—the cosmic microwave background. We can then calculate the rate of energy loss of the CMB and, with some good theoretical knowledge of the temperature at which atoms form, calculate the time needed for the CMB to cool from the temperature at which atoms formed to its current temperature. And we do all this without having to see beyond the part of the universe that we can see.
both the boiling point and the freezing point of water are dependent on the pressure. For example, increasing the pressure may raise the boiling point of water, and consequently raise its boiling point above 100° C. The same phenomenon also occurs during freezing, and is called undercooling. To freeze, there must be a nucleus, that is, small defects, edges, or sharp edges on which the first ice crystals can be formed. If you have pure water in a perfectly smooth container, the water will not freeze, because there is no nucleus. You can then make this water almost instantly freeze by giving it a nucleus, e.g. pouring it. Since the water is colder than its freezing point, as soon as it gets a nucleus, it will freeze almost immediately.
A food gets hot by absorbing heat. The more food that is put into the oven, the more heat it will need. There can only be so much heat produced at certain temperatures because the materials are all different in energy content.
It’s a substance, and since all substances are subject to gravity, it will be drawn toward the nearest celestial body—the Earth, the moon, Mars, and so on.
Weight is a measure of the amount of gravitational force a body experiences.
Yes, but only a little. Fans push air from the bathroom outside. Since unless you’re in a bomb shelter your house isn’t completely airtight, air will get in wherever it can, whether through poorly sealed windows or a single pinhole somewhere in the house.
They are covered with an anti-reflective coating, which increases their efficiency and light-absorbing power. The way they are manufactured, by melting small silicon crystals together, makes them less efficient than black panels, but also much less expensive. They are called polycrystalline because they are made of a large number of small silicon crystals fused together. The black panels are monocrystalline —they are just one large, perfectly aligned crystal—which is more efficient and does not require the anti-reflective coating. The blue panels have an efficiency of 13 to 17%, the black ones of 20 to 22%.
A gas is compressed inside the box by a special machine, the 'compressor'. This makes the gas get hotter, but as long as the gas contains the same amount of heat, it will continue to heat up. So heat too will be compressed. The tubes run along a long way behind the back of the box, so that air from outside circulates over them. This air cools the tubes, and they reach a temperature equal to that of the room. The gas is now uncompressed, that is, it is expanded. But since the hot part of the tubes has taken heat away from the gas, the gas is now at a lower temperature than the room temperature. The cold gas then runs along the tubes to the other end of the box. There the heat of the inside of the box makes the gas warm again, but the inside of the box is getting cooler. The warm gas goes back to the compressor, and in this way it goes on and on.
The flame heats the water and ammonia, and the resulting vapour passes into a condenser, where it condenses into a liquid and goes into another condenser containing hydrogen. The hydrogen mixes with the ammonia, and this reaction absorbs heat from the inside of the cabinet. After the reaction, the hydrogen is separated out, and the ammonia returns to a vapour, which mixes with the water again, and the process is repeated.
Light is composed of photons, which are of the nature of an electro-magnetic wave. When an electric field changes a little, a magnetic field is created, and when a magnetic field changes a little, an electric field is created. So when a magnetic field changes, an electric field is created outside of the region. And when an electric field changes, a magnetic field is created outside of the region. The photon, therefore, cannot do anything but move away from the position of its creation. For example, when an electron falls from a high-energy orbit around an atom or a molecule to a low-energy orbit, light can be likened to a rock thrown into a pond. In the center, the water recedes, pushing the water around it upward, and pushing the water around that upward. Thus, the ripples move away. Q: Why is it that the electric and magnetic fields are so connected? A: That is one of the great unsolved problems of physics. There are many theories and many models in the physics field. None of these theories is proven, but we try to eliminate the bad ones.
You just said it yourself: the universe is expanding, but the amount of energy is the same; so it cools as it expands.
There are two ways. The first is via satellite. The global positioning system satellites have atomic clocks in them. They are also almost in line of sight at the speed of light. And with only small differences in the speed of light over relatively short distances, it is very easy to calculate the exact difference in time using high-precision timers and special receivers. So, by using the global positioning system to distribute time from the American atomic clock, the error between the different atomic clocks can be kept down to ten billionths of a second. The other way is by direct light signal. The speed of light is the same for all, so the length of the cable can be accurately calculated. The delay can be measured by the atomic clock directly, and the difference can be controlled within a few billionths of a second.
I can't do it, but basically you reverse the way you walk normally. The trick is to put all your weight on your front foot and glide the other foot along the ground lightly. Now, it takes a lot of practice, but eventually it becomes perfectly natural.
We're talking about 14 billion years in our (earth's) frame. As long as we specify where we are, there is no problem of relative time.
The object exists and is responsible for this effect. Why would there be a constant transfer of energy? Since no work is being done, there is no reason why energy should be expended.
The strings are only slightly affected by gravity, and therefore the absence of gravity would not produce any measurable difference. If you are in a station with an atmosphere, it will sound almost the same as on earth, although you would have to rely on the acoustics of the apparatus around you. If you are not firmly connected, you will be constantly rotating in the opposite direction to the motion of your arms, but the whole rotation will be negligible. A possible effect, after a while, is that the strings, because they are vibrating, would push the air away in a particular direction. Then after a while, you would start to turn in the opposite direction to this direction. Outside, without an atmosphere, the strings would have nothing to transfer their vibration to and would not produce a sound. But they would vibrate for a long time because they would not lose energy in producing sound. But this energy would finally be converted into heat by the resistance of the violin and your hands and then dissipate.
A matter of wavelength. An efficient antenna must be on the order of the wavelength it is to pick up, which is possible with radio waves but would have to be microscopic with visible light (about half a micron). Another way of putting it is that in its properties of wave and particle, at long wavelengths (low energies), it behaves more like a wave, and more like a particle (photon) at shorter wavelengths (greater energies). Light lies somewhere in between and can behave as both: like a wave in interference experiments (you can find many examples of the double-slit experiment on the Internet), and like a particle in special devices that can pick up individual photons.
Light, as it strikes something, is absorbed a little; and, depending on the nature of the object, a different proportion of different rays is reflected or absorbed, depending on the nature of the object. But, in the end, all the light will be absorbed by something in the room, and this is very quick because of the speed of light.
There is a concept called “entropy,” which is a peculiar way of expressing “chaos.” It goes like this: suppose you have a glass of water coloured red and another of blue; you cannot put them together in the same glass and expect the dyes to mix. The red water is full of red particles, the blue water of blue particles. If you put the two glasses together it is as if the universe collapsed. The blue particles want to move where the red particles are, the red particles want to move where the blue particles are. Eventually they are equally distributed and you have purple water. So in essence, unless you work against it, the system tends to go from order to disorder. That’s entropy. This is exactly what happens with heat. Suppose you put a flame under one side of a spoon, it will eventually heat up all over. You cannot keep one side hot and the other cold for long. The red and blue water analogy holds here too. Everything is made of particles. When something is warm, its particles are vibrating, they move faster. When it’s cold they move more slowly. So if you heat one side of the spoon, those fast particles are constantly knocking against the slow ones, which then in turn make the slow ones go faster. At the same time the fast particles lose some of their energy and slow down, which is why the spoon will eventually heat up evenly. That’s entropy in action. The universe abhors that sort of arrangement, where there is a lot of heat in one place (the sun, the earth) and almost none in another (space). It wants everything to be chaotic, in other words evenly distributed. So the heat death of the universe is like the spoon analogy on a gigantic scale. The earth is the spoon, and we are losing heat to the universe. The sun is sending its particles at us, and we are getting warmer. That’s not a good arrangement, the universe doesn’t like it. One day the sun will have used up all its fuel and there will be nothing left to make its reactions go. Then it will stop giving off heat. The earth will then cool down, and will eventually reach the same temperature as space around it. And that is how it will go on for ever. The heat will eventually stop coming in from the sun. In a few million years’ time everything will have reached the same temperature. That’s the heat death. It is not a nice place to be for us.
We can’t. We can only estimate the minimum size, and it could be infinite. We know how big the observable universe is, and that’s determined by how old the universe is and how it expands, and that yields a radius of 46.5 billion light-years. This is the part of the universe that we can observe from earth. The radius is the current radius. What is now 46.5 billion light-years away was a lot closer when it emitted the light that is now reaching us. The light from it has only been traveling as long as the universe has existed. So, for example, if an object is 46.5 billion light-years away, then the light from it has traveled only 13.7 billion light-years. From the measurement of the universe’s flatness, it can be deduced that the universe is at least 250 times bigger than the observable universe. That means that it may be finite, but it may also be infinite. That is an open question. We may never know the answer. So we don’t know the size of the universe, it’s an open question where we have not reached a conclusion. You can read more about this on the wikipedia page about the universe.
The wind blows outside the open window and causes a local vacuum based on the Venturi principle. This vacuum, in turn, causes air inside the room to rush in so as to equalize the pressures. The air inside the room rushes towards the window, which in turn causes the door to open.
B: C: D: The water in all three boxes is at the same level, and the pipe connecting them is at the same level? Q: The water in box 1 and box 3 is higher than the water in box 2.
Gas or diesel engines require the engine to spin in order to give any power to the wheels. If you want more power, you can only increase the amount of fuel to a certain point. Getting more power from an engine means making it spin faster at some point. But the faster it spins, the more energy it consumes in just spinning itself, and there is a limit to how fast you can make all the countless moving parts spin. In order to get the most power out of an engine, it should spin as slowly as possible. So the question is, how can you get the engine to turn fast or slow depending on how fast the wheels turn? The answer is a gearbox, which allows you to change the ratio between the engine speed and wheel speed. If you want lots of power but want to go slowly, then low gears are used, which means that the engine is turned a lot of times for each wheel spin. If you want to go fast but still use the least possible fuel, then high gears are used. Electric motors do not have this problem. To get more power out of an electric motor, you just feed it more electricity. If you want even more power, then you feed it even more electricity. The speed at which the motor turns is a minor consideration in how much power it can give, so there is much less need to use a gearbox to choose the speed of the motor for a certain speed of the car.
Your body temperature is approximately 37° C. But your body is always releasing heat. The heat must go somewhere, and it flows from hot to cold. Air is a poor conductor of heat. A temperature difference between hot and cold in the air helps to overcome the poor heat conductivity (which is not the right word, but it is used here to express this concept). Water is a good heat conductor. Therefore, if the water is cold, it will take heat from your body too quickly, and your body must work harder to regain the lost heat. If the water is warmer, the lower temperature difference helps to overcome the high heat conductivity. In hot air, the poor heat conductivity makes your body heat up, which can only be solved by perspiring, which is unpleasant for you, or by raising your body temperature, which is unpleasant and dangerous. Therefore, it is good to be in cool air or warm water, because they are closest to the heat produced by your body.
well, we live on continents, not on peninsulas. And yes, we see different stars when we are south of the equator than when we are north of it. You can’t see the Southern Cross from Maine, and you can’t see the Big Dipper from South Africa, for example. Stars that are more in line with our equator are visible in both hemispheres.
Please be more precise. I’m not sure what you’re talking about.
But we do have a much more reliable source of energy. Lightning is unpredictable and does not occur often enough to meet the modern demand for energy. We can generate far more electricity with the power stations we already have and we can do it reliably enough that we can build a system on it and not have to wait for good weather.
The trampoline example is useful for showing how the orbits move, but it can be overanalyzed (“What is it that’s pulling the ball down?”). I prefer the one where you and I are standing a meter apart at the equator, with a compass in our hand and heading north. Now, if the earth was flat, longitudes would be parallel, and every time I looked over at you you would be a meter away. But because the earth is curved, the longitudes are directed toward the poles, so that, little by little, while we are both heading north, we are getting closer and closer. If we did not know that the earth was curved, we would think that there is some sort of force that is pulling us together. That is how spacetime is. Everything (even light itself) is following its own “straight line” (geodesic), but the curve of these lines is what creates gravity, makes light rays curve, and so on.
The atmosphere is not under uniform pressure everywhere. There are zones of high pressure and zones of low pressure. Wind is simply the air flowing from zones of high pressure to zones of low pressure. The difference in pressure is generally caused by the difference in temperature. You can learn more here:
. No, the jumping and landing involves much greater acceleration than standing. You go from a speed to a stop in a very short distance (depending on the density of your shoe). So a good bit of acceleration is needed besides the regular 9.8 m/s2 needed to keep you at the same distance from the center of the earth.
The question is based on a common misunderstanding. The Big Bang did not happen in a particular place, it happened everywhere. The only difference is that the places were much closer together in the early universe, so that all places were almost exactly the same distance from each other. As the universe grew, distances quickly grew. Things did not move through space, but space itself was getting farther away from other places. Even when it was very close and dense, the universe was probably infinite.
Ionizing radiation can knock an electron off an atom. (The radiation gives the electron enough energy to tear itself away from its atom.) These electrons are the things that hold molecules together, so if you throw one away, the molecule suddenly has an end hanging off, and it will quickly try to find another to replace it. (It will react with whatever it can find.) Now, DNA is a very long and complex molecule. You can damage it, and it might actually disintegrate (in which case, the cell is basically dead), but you might also damage it without making it totally useless, and the genes it carries might change. That might make the cell go crazy, as cancerous cells do, when their controls and mechanisms for destroying themselves malfunction. But as you can see, this is pretty much just a matter of chance. So small doses of radiation are pretty safe (and that’s what we’re exposed to all the time). But the more radiation you get, the more likely it is that something will go wrong in a bad way.
Imagination alight. Imagine a ray of light emitted or reflected from a particular point on the object, and that, if the aperture is infinitely small, then the ray of light can end up only at one place after passing through it. Then imagine the rays from all parts of the object; the result is the perfect picture of the object. If the aperture is large, however, you can have two rays of light coming from a particular point on the object, at slightly different angles, but they still pass through the aperture, and when the single point is somehow represented in two places after passing through the aperture, then the result is blur.
After 500 million years of evolution of life on earth, we have adapted to a three dimensional existence. Some living beings are capable of making a plan for the future and thus enter into the dimension of time. A fourth spatial dimension has no significance in our life as yet. That is if it exists. Therefore not only man but no animal can visualize it. A four dimensional life is not in the genetic makeup of the earth.
[fa] It is the usual case that hydrogen is the proton and not deuterium (H-2) or tritium (H-3), then the collision of three is a combination of helium. The hydrogen reaction is so rare that it takes billions of years for the sun to keep going and we try to economize by isolating deuterium and tritium in the laboratory rather than slowly acquiring it. But if all three are squeezed together, they will, for a very short time, result in lithium; but without the connection of the neutrons, they will fall apart very quickly. Lithium 4 decays into helium 3 in 910-23 sec, and Li 3 even less; which makes the helium half-life of 109 sec look quite long in comparison.
because there is a gigantic fusion reaction, instead of a simple combustion. The sun transforms lighter elements into heavier ones, giving off light, heat and energy. Because there is so much sun, it can do this for a very long time.
This is an interesting question. We actually don’t know what stuff looks like, in the sense of “does anyone else experience the same visual sensations as I do?” What matters is the subjective part. We can measure, for example, how the cells in our eyes respond to a certain color. But whether your red is the same as my red, we don’t know. Your red could be my blue subjectively, but there’s no way to find out, because we could agree on everything, but we couldn’t express or show our inner sensations in an objective way. It’s not exactly Eli, but if you’re interested in the subject of how we create reality, you should read up on constructivism, which takes a different view of how we actually create reality in our minds.
And then, it is worth noting that a bonfire in the open air is of course surrounded by space, so there are no surfaces to bounce off. The light in the house bounces off the walls and ceiling, so it appears to go further. Even the fireplace in the house is designed to dissipate heat and light as quickly as possible, so as not to heat up the surrounding surfaces and make them combustible.
1: Take a piece of paper 2: cut out a strip on one of the longer edges. It should not be too thin, nor too wide, about 3 or 4 centimeters will do. 3: turn one of the shorter edges over and, without letting go, glue it to the other end of the strip 3: you will be going back to where you started, though you haven’t been crossing any edges
On top of the dilation of the pupil mentioned by another poster, there is also the reflection on the glass surface: if you're in a room at night and you light a lamp, you will notice that you can clearly see the reflected room on the window but you can't see the outside. This is because the light from the lamp that is reflected by the glass is much more intense than the light coming from outside which is thus cancelled out by the first. The result is that your eye sees only the reflected light and is unable to see the outside.
The hot gas in outer space is dispersed and spreads out when it is not too much of it and when it is left alone. Its molecules just float apart and the pressure of the gas goes to zero. And we know the gas laws: when the pressure goes to zero, so does the temperature. So the gas cools off when this happens. (Remark: well, sort of.) But it doesn't get as close to absolute zero as it would be if there were no radiation at all. (Things cannot really get to absolute zero if there is also no radiation at all coming from outside.) But if there is enough gas, its gravitation takes over and overcomes the spreading-out. Gravity compresses the gas into a smaller space and this makes the pressure rise and the temperature. From such a beginning can come a gas planet like Jupiter or Saturn. And if there is even more gas, it can get so hot inside that fusion starts, and then it's no planet anymore, but a star, a sunlike star.
The difference between a foot parking brake and a handbrake is that the brake pedal is designed to prevent wheel lockup. Moreover, most modern cars have ABS brakes. The brakes on a handbrake are not designed to be used during driving. Indeed, they are specifically designed to lock the wheels, so that it is easier to execute a turn with a handbrake.
Our eyes have three types of cones, each tuned to the wavelengths roughly corresponding to red, green, and blue. Now a purple object is one that has absorbed a lot of the green and reflects blue and red. This stimulates the red and blue cones simultaneously, which your brain translates into a bluish-red sensation, which we call purple.
They fall. But they don’t fall where they were shot, because of the wind. They’re blown off course and they land somewhere else. But there are cases where a bullet shot up in the air has hit a person, it’s quite dangerous. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebratory_firing#Major_incidents
Because light is not the same as heat. Metal is a conductor of heat (among other things).
A nebula requires an element which, when it absorbs a neutron (a subatomic particle) of any energy level, will split into two, releasing energy and further neutrons, which will carry on the reaction. It is not a matter of splitting one atom, but of setting up a chain reaction that can split a quadrillion atoms in a second. There are only a small number of such elements, called ‘fissile’, and of these only two are relatively easy to extract: uranium-235, a kind of uranium that can be separated from natural uranium in special ways, and plutonium-239, an artificially manufactured element that can be created in a kiln. These are not ‘easy’ to extract in any ordinary sense of the word, but are a lot easier than the other fissile elements. There are real physical limits on what is possible. Uranium-238, the most common type of uranium, cannot be used for this purpose, because it can split up, but only when it absorbs a high-energy neutron, and the neutrons created in the splitting of atoms are not sufficiently high-energy to set up a chain reaction in U-238. This is why uranium-235 has to be separated from U-238.
It... isn’t. The most basic law of the universe is that energy is neither created nor destroyed. If you mean to ask, “Why do electrical generators have things that go around and around?” then it’s because of the way we convert one type of energy into another. We use one type of energy—like chemical energy in petroleum or mechanical energy from the wind—to spin a magnet around a conductor. That makes the electrons in the conductor spin. When the electrons are moving, that’s what we call electricity. (Remember that electricity is an action, not a noun.) The easiest way to get something spinning is with a spinning object. Otherwise, you’d have to use something like the carriage return on a typewriter or something even more complicated, less efficient, and harder to build and use. Is that clear?
Physics is a science of laws, engineering is a science of how to use these laws for building. The two are closely related, in the same way as pure mathematics and applied mathematics, biology and medicine, mathematics and computation, but they have different goals. For example, physics gives us the knowledge of the strength of a metal, and why one metal is stronger than another. The science of engineering tells us how to use this strength for building a bridge which will not collapse.
When light strikes an object, part of it reflects (or bounces off). The rest goes through (transmitted) or is absorbed. Black-colored objects absorb most of the visible light that doesn’t bounce off. Those that do bounce off can be shiny if the surface is very smooth or polished. Sometimes gloss is added on purpose, with a clear top coat that increases the reflection before it strikes the black paint and is absorbed.
Because there is not enough hot-melt glue inside them. The transformer is a coil of wire wound around an iron core, and when current flows through the wire, the magnetic field created by the current will make the core squeeze out and the wires be pulled in, and vice versa, with the field inversion. In the case of large transformers on a power pole, this means a few hundred kilograms of metal moving, which is what causes the familiar sound of 50 or 60 Hz. In small transformers, 132 kilohertz is common, so you can't hear the sound of a field switching over, but you can hear the natural vibration of the iron. A thick layer of hot-melt glue will usually solve the problem. It will fix the core to the case and dampen the vibration effectively.
There's an engineering concept called "slip" that measures the slow movement of fasteners, glue, or other construction members from their intended position due to usage, vibrations, thermal expansion, etc. I remember studying it in school to understand why subway tiles eventually fall from the walls and ceilings.
what? It's an inductive thing. Physics is an inductive science, that is, it constructs knowledge from observation and experiment, and the truth of a statement is judged by whether or not it coincides with observation. Therefore, the purpose of physics is to look at the world and formalize it. Therefore, Newton's laws of motion are not deduced in the mathematical sense, but they are axioms. A statement that cannot be mathematically derived is assumed to be true as a starting point for formulating the theory. If it turns out that these axioms do not explain and predict the external world accurately, they are changed or discarded. Newton simply observed the movements of the things and tried to find the equations that would best fit this movement. This is in addition to the assumption that the previous observations and statements of the scholar had been considered.
Nothing. The universe is the expansion of space itself. The concept of space without space does not exist—at least according to the most recent knowledge of physics. For human beings, this is difficult to understand, since we can see and measure only the space in which we live. Likewise, it is difficult for us to imagine four, five, or six dimensions of space, when we are familiar with only three.
They do not exist to distribute water. They exist to keep up the pressure. Why? Because gravity costs nothing. Think of a water tower as a bathtub. You fill it up to the brim, then you open the drain. The tube is then under pressure because of the full bathtub, which means that the water in the bathtub keeps the tube under pressure, and this will remain until the water is completely drained. The water tower works the same way, except that the drain is always open. When the water level is low, the pump takes over and fills the water tower faster than it is drained. Gravity keeps the tube under pressure. That is why water towers are high up and not at ground level. This means that the water tower is always higher than the pipes in the area and thus maintains the pressure. The calculation is simple: it costs a municipality much less to turn on the pump every now and then and put the water in a water tower than to turn on the pump day and night to keep the pipes under pressure.
When the wind is blowing from the opposite side of the house, it flows over the top of it. Since the house isn't aerodynamic, it creates a lower pressure on the other side than the stationary air inside the house. And the air escapes. A fluid like air tends to go from high pressure to low pressure. So since the pressure is very low on the other side of the house, it's like the wind is blowing right out the window.
Sound is nothing but vibration. When you clap your hands, the air around them vibrates and reaches the ears, which then interpret the vibration as sound.
It depends on the degree of scatter. The contrast is simply “light” or “no light”. If the light scatters into the dark zones, you have “light” and “some light” which, intuitively speaking, is less contrast. If all the light scatters, you have “some light” and “some light,” which is zero contrast, and no image.
Speed affects frequency in that more or less of a certain type will pass a given point in a second, and less will pass. That means that frequency is proportional to the speed of the wave. The period is the inverse of the frequency. It is the time that one wave takes to pass through a given point. If the waves move faster, that time will be shorter, if they move slower, it will be longer. Period is inversely proportional to the speed of the wave.
A demonstration would help explain this. Take your children outside and stand still. Slowly turn around and point at the sky. The children have to walk so that you point at them. First they start at your side so that they just have to walk to keep up. Then let them go farther away, keep turning slowly and watch them run to keep up.
It's not necessary. The average home has enough ventilation. Homes are relatively airtight for energy efficiency reasons. The insulating of a home is primarily based on preventing heat radiation and direct heat transfer through the walls and windows, not on convection. The air in a home carries an incredibly small amount of heat, so replacing it throughout the day is not so important. If you notice a draft, that's obviously a problem, but it's not necessary for sufficient ventilation. The air humidity becomes a greater concern than CO2 if you never open a window or go outside.
Black is a lack of color, while white is the presence of every color. That’s my understanding.
The wiper switch is located on the steering wheel, not far from the explosive that triggers the airbag. The switch often gets broken and stuck on after an explosion.
Smaller atoms may not experience aging but larger ones do. Larger atoms experience radioactive decay. Also, they lose energy over time. The energy loss is not as obvious as the radioactive decay. The Second Law of Thermodynamics is a way of explaining this, if you don’t know it.
The energy that repels two magnets is the energy you put in when you put them together; it is analogous to the energy a stretched spring gives back. It doesn't last forever, because magnets lose their magnetism with time, but since it does not cost energy to maintain the magnetic field, there is no fundamental limit to how long they can be kept in that state. A good magnet might last for thousands of years.
It’s the rails, they literally corrode away. The rail gun and the gauss gun are often confused but they are quite different, so let me be clear what we’re talking about. The coil gun has an electric current running through coils to create a powerful magnetic field that can accelerate an iron projectile. The rail gun has two conductive rails that a conductive projectile or sled slides down, the current runs down the rails, goes through the projectile, back up the rail, and it’s this that’s a problem. The projectile doesn’t have very good electrical contact with the rails so an arc forms and corrodes the rail down the length of the barrel, reducing its service life. The navy’s experimental model used to burn out the rails after a few shots, later they said they lasted 400 shots, but it’s not known how powerful those shots were. The rails also generate a powerful magnetic field when a current runs down them, and they move away from each other, so you need large bolts to hold them together.
In a way, yes. Generally speaking, the rule of thumb ‘bigger boat = less effected by waves’ is true from one point of view but fails dismally from another. So, in a nutshell, small boats have little mass. The mass of the water in motion and its momentum are great and have a huge effect on small boats, on many ships. They can literally transport mountains of moving steel through the water and lift up battleships and aircraft carriers if the sea gets bad enough. With increased mass, waves have a decreasing effect, until they reach a significant size. While we can always build bigger ships, the seas can always produce bigger waves. Ships so big that they would cross an oceanic stretch many square miles wide would be greatly effected by the changing tides and waves on many fronts. The genius that it would take to build a floating island would have to deal not only with the water but also with the specific gravity of the water, the air pressure, the temperature of the air and water, to prevent the ocean from swallowing this hypothetical floating island. The bigger the thing is, the more forces are at play against it. And they don’t always operate evenly.
Take a piece of buttered bread and strap it to a cat, butter facing outwards. Lift the cat by its collar and let it go. As it is an axiom of the universe that buttered bread will fall buttered-side-down, so another axiom states that cats always land on their feet. When you combine the two together, dropping the combination will of course nullify the effect of one of the laws of the universe, which will of course result in the contravention of the second law. It is only the interruption of the law of the universe by a dog or a manga character late for school that would affect the course of the cat.
Traditionally it has been part of physics, but the parts of physics involved in it simply migrated to engineering. The advantages of flow, turbulence, etc., modelling are absolutely priceless for virtually all kinds of machinery, vehicles, medical appliances, and so on. It is as relevant to everyday life (and to government interests...) as are improvements in electronics. And therefore most of the research is conducted or out-sourced by engineering companies, often with major governmental military budgets. Continuum mechanics does have some importance in the context of outer space, for instance it plays a crucial role in explaining the formation of our own solar system from spinning gas and dust. Recently there has been some discussion about whether the solar system has a shockwave, since space itself is on the scale of the shockwave a weak continuum. But such theory about space is, of course, much less relevant to everyday life (and big guns) and is rather something cool for research establishments to play with. And this is what physics is more and more becoming—researching cool, but more esoteric stuff.
It really can’t. What heater are you referring to? They might be inefficient for some uses (say, drying leaves in the winter), but not for others (say, making soup in the summer). But you’re right that all that electricity is just wasted as heat.
- Oesophagus is muscular tube and it stretches towards stomach by peristaltic movement of its wall, like an worm in the ground which has no limbs. So it is possible to eat upside down. But I don’t think it is comfortable.
It's to help separate the dirt from the air. Particles of dust are heavier than air and so they can't go around as fast as the air swirling around the vortex. So instead of all the dust stopping up on the filter, most of it sticks to the outside walls, increasing the amount of dust the vacuum can pick up before it clogs up.
The bacilli produce the poison as a by-product of their digestive processes. That is no more a violation of the first law of thermodynamics than your eating, urinating, and defecating.
You can. But you’ll have to carry all that fuel with you, so there’ll be a lot more mass to accelerate, which means a lot more fuel. But in theory, if you had a sufficiently efficient engine or if you had an external source of fuel to supply you as you accelerate, you could go pretty fast. At some point, the effects of special relativity would take over and the faster you go, the heavier you get, and then you’d need even more fuel to accelerate yourself, and that’s more advanced stuff for you.
Newtonian motion, in which an object is attracted to a target and retained by the centrifugal force of its own weight; the atoms are the atoms in which they are found. The force of an atom's nucleus is like a stretched-out rubber band which will snap back when you pull on it, or give it a thump with a bat, or a gamma ray. This effect can be produced with far less energy than that. Generally speaking, ionizing radiation is everything from ultra-violet C rays through X-rays to gamma rays. And they all have enough energy to break off an atom's nucleus and fling it outwards, but for less energetic radiation, the most you can do is to absorb it, then transform that energy into movement (wobblier atoms) or into light (things that glow under a black light).
No. The engines of planes don't work without oxygen to light the fuel and air to pull through the rotors, so they can't fly in space. But yes, if a plane somehow reaches the right speed at the right height, like the ISS, then it too will continue to fall (or rather continue to circle the earth). Anything will do that. That's why all the satellites and the moon don't crash. Or why the earth itself doesn't crash into the sun. In the atmosphere, there's no way to fly without engines. Friction slows everything down, and the whole business of keeping your speed so you can fall and circle the earth doesn't work. If you're not lighter than air, you need some kind of power to keep you up. The ISS doesn't have enough to keep it up.
It is not that they do not touch each other but that they repel each other. In other words, one atom pushes another, which pushes another, and so on.
We do get more energy every day, but we don't keep it. We and all the other things on earth constantly radiate and lose the energy we get from the sun, it is just a passing thing for us. To keep this energy, we have to convert it into something more permanent. This is possible for plants by means of photosynthesis. Light + water = more plant. The sun's energy, which hit the leaf, is now stored in the new plant that grows from it. On top of that, there is also a photovoltaic method, i.e. the panels that catch and store the energy of the sun, by converting sunlight into electricity. A: A lot of the energy we get from the sun warms up our planet during the day and is lost again at night. The atmosphere prevents us from completely losing our heat and freezing to death during this short time, until the sun rises again the next day and heats the other side of the earth. Then it all happens again. If the sun suddenly disappeared and the night lasted forever, we would quickly lose all the heat trapped by the atmosphere and freeze to space temperature of -180 ° C. Good thing that the sun still rises every day and warms us up!
1. The deterioration is cumulative. So it's not just a matter of X pieces failing in a given time, but a disproportionate number of parts that have failed, and the cost of launching things into space is already prohibitive. 2. Not everything can be fixed in space. The station is a complex piece of equipment and it may simply not be possible to get hold of the parts needed to replace all the faulty ones. 3. If it ends up having to be replaced, then why not make use of the advances in technology to replace the whole station with something better? This would require diverting resources from the current station to a new one.
Imagine the fluid as a group of molecules. When the channel is wide, many molecules can go through it at once, but when it's narrow, only a few can go through. To keep the flow at the same rate, more molecules must pass through the narrow space in the same time, so the molecules move faster.
We see it in many charts and diagrams. If you have made a trip and drew a line on a map, that line is a representation of your trip through space (across the map) and it is also a representation of your trip through time, as it is impossible for you to be anywhere else on the line during the course of the trip. If you plot the population of a country over the years, the population is shown moving through time. These are the everyday examples of movement through time. In physics, the mathematics are more complex, but the meaning is really not much different from the examples above. There are some non-intuitive concepts in physics that emerge in connection with very heavy objects (with very high gravitation) and very high velocities. In everyday life, we tend to think of time as “absolute”—everybody keeps the same clock. Einstein’s theory and experiments show that movement through space affects movement through time. Time is relative to the observer. But a deeper understanding requires some college physics.
By theoretic considerations, they are already pulled down by gravity now, but they have enough lateral momentum to not crash into the Earth. Thus, the thing that pulls them down is slowing down. At the altitude of a satellite, for example, there is a very slight drag from the very top of the atmosphere, and after a hundred years or so, the object will gradually slow down and crash into the earth. The things which are much higher in the orbit, like the moon and certain satellites, can stay in orbit for billions of years without getting disturbed.
(the molecules) – atoms move in many ways, they vibrate, they spin, they move from one place to another, and this all goes to the concept of hotness and coldness. If something is hot, it means that the atoms in it are vibrating, spinning or moving faster than in cold. But this concept of hot and cold is not quite a physical concept. The atoms can move (as described above). Movement is energy, and so a moving atom has more energy than a non-moving atom. And a faster moving atom has more energy than a slower moving atom. We call this energy heat, and this heat can be converted into temperature. But what makes 40°F cold and 100°F hot? If I invented a new temperature scale and told you that it was 800° on that scale, you wouldn't know if it was "hot" or "cold". And that's because hot and cold are sensations created by the brain. When something with temperature touches your body, this temperature (heat) makes the nerves of your skin twitches, which sends chemical and electrical signals to your brain, which in turn creates a sensation of hot or cold. Why are we digging this dungeon? Because the key to why the wind is hot or cold lies in this. You do not feel the cold or heat of an object only by its temperature, but by the effect it has on your body's ability to reject heat. Remember that we are warm-blooded beings and always generate heat, which we have to reject or we will be overheated and die. And this is important because the wind has more energy than the calm air, which should have a higher temperature, but you feel the wind as a colder feeling than the calm air. Not a paradox? No, because in the calm air, the air next to your body is warmed by your body and does not go anywhere, so it is equal to your skin temperature. Then your body cannot reject any more heat and begins to heat up. You feel the "warmth". But in the wind, the air next to your body is constantly being blown away and replaced by new air, which allows your body to constantly reject heat and transfer it to the new air, so you feel the "coolness". Although the wind can be hotter than the calm air, the feeling of cold or heat is not just about the temperature of the air, but also about how well or how bad you can reject the heat that your body generates at all times.
The International Bureau of the Metric System (BIPM), which is responsible for the official definition of the metric system, has been making efforts to establish the system of the metric system in accordance with the fundamental properties of the universe. Earlier, the metre was defined by the radius of the earth, which is fine for the earth, but if we want to settle on other planets, we need an absolute standard. In 1983 the definition of the metre was changed to "the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a tenth of a second." We know that the speed of light is 299,792,458 metres per second and that it does not change. Now we base the length of the metre on the speed of light.
Suppose you wear gloves. Even though you never actually touch the item, you can feel its texture. The glove acts as a force-transmitter between the item and your hand. With a thick glove, it’s even hard to feel slight differences in the surface of the item. But if there is a larger difference, you can feel it easily. Texture is nothing but the surface of the item and how it responds to the force of your hand. So with thin gloves you can feel any texture. The “glove” of the attractive forces of atoms is just a few atoms thick.
The windshield is not completely flat. It curves like a water glass or a lens. And just as with a water glass or a lens, it makes the light curve. Therefore, at this point, the road seems to curve down.
Light moves at that speed because it is the limit, not the other way around. All massless phenomena, especially information about any events, is limited to this speed, and light is just an example of this limit (since photons are massless). Perhaps a more appropriate term would be “the speed of causality” or “the ratio between length and time.”
