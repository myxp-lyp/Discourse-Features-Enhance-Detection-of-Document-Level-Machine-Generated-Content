I don't understand the question, but we have helicopters, planes, rockets... The best we can do is to consider gravity a fundamental property of all objects that have mass. Imagine four people holding a sheet at the four corners. The sheet is perfectly level and you can roll a ball from one end to the other almost in a straight line. Now put an orange in the middle, the sheet is sagging under the orange, now, if you want to roll a ball from one end to the other, the ball will fall on the orange. Gravity is the same, but in three dimensions. Everything that has mass deflects space-time towards itself so that whatever is near it is pulled away from it, or even towards it. Gravity is not a thing or a force, but a property of the universe.
Basically, they are related to the amount of "advantage" which a lever and a winch give you. A lever or a pulley can make a heavy object move, because they transform a weak but large movement into a small but strong movement. For example, by operating a come-along, you move a meter of the long lever with your arm, which is transformed into moving the heavy load one centimeter. If you do this (divide the distance by a hundred) you multiply the force by a hundred, and so you can handle a weight you could move with 50 kilograms by hand, but with the help of the come-along you can handle a weight of 5,000 kilograms. When using a ratchet strap to secure a load, the lever you move is much shorter and therefore moves less. But you have to know that if the end of the lever moves ten centimeters and the ratchet strap moves one centimeter, your force is multiplied by ten. So you convert your strength of 50 kilograms into a strength that can lift 500 kilograms. When the strap is pulled to the point where it feels as if 500 kilograms are pulling on it, your strength of 50 kilograms is no longer enough to tighten it any more. So, in essence, a come-along has a longer lever to give you a larger advantage.
it passes through an infinite number of points in any positive time. It may be useful to remember that the time it takes to move is infinitely divided, just as the unit length is infinitely divided.
The air in the car is still 25° C, but when the window is open, the air circulates briskly, and because the moving air is slightly cooler than the temperature of the human body, it is felt to be cooler than the still air—hence the wind chill factor mentioned in weather reports. It is also the reason why a fan blowing on you feels cooler than the air in the room, even though the air is at the same temperature.
It can't. That's not true at all. There are plenty of times when it's not visible when it's night where you are, because the world isn't flat.
An absolute vacuum contains nothing; it is, in a word, void. Space, on the other hand, is the space outside a planet's atmosphere, and contains the helium of the sun's rays, spaceships, comets, asteroids, and many other interesting things that the vacuum, by definition, cannot contain.
; First of all, you're not creating a vacuum by pushing on the bulb. What you're doing is pushing the air in the bulb towards the tip of the tube. Now, when you let go of the bulb and it wants to go back to its original shape (we'll come back to that), the liquid in the tip will be pushed in. Basically, the liquid in the bulb has a certain tension to it and, being a bulb, wants to be flattened, not squeezed, so, when it's flattened, it fills with air from outside and the liquid is pushed into the tube. A very good question.
This phenomenon is called cavitation. When a bullet is fired into the water, or a blade rotates rapidly, they produce a vacuum behind them. If the vacuum is deep enough, the water will turn from liquid to gas and this is the source of the bubbles. They are made of water vapour.
I am a hearing scientist with a PhD in sound localization. What you hear are sine waves, very clean sine waves. They are often very high-pitched. One of the ways you could tell where a sound is coming from is by the difference between the times when the sounds arrive at each ear. The sounds come first to the ear closest to you. But that doesn’t work so well with sine waves because there are so many distinct frequencies. For the higher sounds, the wavelength is close to the size of your head. And if you miss the start of the sound, it’s impossible to tell which ear gets it first, because the sound repeats in the same order. The lower the sound, the easier it is because the size of your head limits the amount of difference between the start and finish of the sound. With complex sounds, it’s much easier to tell which ear gets it first by comparing the whole complex signal. But the most reliable way to pinpoint a sound’s location is by the difference in level between the ears. The higher the pitch, the more reliable this is because the lower sounds can bend around your head better and so the difference in level is less. If the sound is between the two frequency extremes, it’s impossible to use either method. But even if you can use the difference in level, the head is pretty symmetrical. We can tell left from right, but it’s not so easy to tell top from bottom. The way out is to move your head, but if the sounds are short bursts, there’s hardly time before the burst is over. Your brain has to make a rough guess as to the position of the next sound. This is why Tesco vans in Britain now use radio-like noise bursts when they reverse. Edit: Thanks, kind strangers. I take this opportunity to remind people not to use cotton buds (Q-tips) unless they want a perforated ear drum. And also to wear hearing protection. Rock concerts are loud! Get yourself some good quality earplugs. Noise-induced hearing loss is not nice, and it can’t be cured.
The two eyes in front of the head allow simultaneous two-dimensional vision, which the brain translates into three-dimensional vision. There are a number of other things that are going on here, but essentially the eyes allow us to determine the speed and direction of an object, and then you can predict its position. Practice makes perfect.
They are designed to open inwards. The greater air pressure acts as a force holding the doors closed.
Moving electrons make electrical energy which is used to do work. In D.C. the flow is in one direction, in A.C. it is alternating. The only way to understand this is to visualize the work of a saw cutting through a tree: D.C. is like a saw which can only be pushed, so you need a long saw to cut through a tree. A.C. is like a saw which can be pushed and pulled and so you need only a short saw to cut the tree.
Specifically, the problem is that you can't know both the speed and location simultaneously, indefinitely precisely, and that's a principle of quantum mechanics. But the question isn't actually why can't you know them both. This is because it's not a matter of "not knowing"—it's not that these quantities have values that "practically" can't be known. Quantum mechanics, in the early twentieth century, showed that in the physical world it's literally impossible for these two quantities to have simultaneous values of infinite precision. And it's not just a question of momentum and location; there are many different combinations of quantities that behave this way in the quantum mechanical treatment. You can get a little insight into the question by experimenting with a waveform generator in an audio editing program: if you choose pulses or sine waves from the waveform generator's menu, you can display both the corresponding waveform and its Fourier transform by clicking on the appropriate buttons. You'll see that a pulse with a very small amplitude can't be represented by both the amplitude and the spectrum of the waveform. These principles don't affect us in our everyday life, because their effects are too small to be measurable with rulers and speedometers when applied to things like people and cars.
Because a lot of math was created to model the universe, and the universe— for some reason—appears to obey a fundamental set of laws that do not change.
We can transmit it over long distances with low losses and a cheap installation. We can also modulate it to send signals. And we are good at changing back and forth between electricity and other kinds of energy. Other common means of transmitting energy are: heat, but there are high losses in the long run; kinetic, but the transmission line would be heavy if you had to go over long distances (a long series of shafts?); chemical, but we haven't gotten very good at converting chemical energy directly into motion without first converting it into heat (hydrocarbons and combustion engines) or electricity (battery and motor, fuel cell).
Because they are very far away. If you hold a stick at one end and move it slightly, the other end will move a great distance, and the farther the stick is the greater the movement. Similarly, the farther an object is from us, the less we have to move our heads to see it, and because we have to move our heads so little to see it, it seems to move very slowly to our brains. The brain is surprisingly bad at grasping three-dimensional space.
[eli5] A typical formula for the conversion of colors into shades of gray is.299 R,.587 G,.114 B, which agrees with your experience. And then the human luminous efficiency curve is less sensitive to blue than to red. (But note that the opposite is true for scotopic vision.)
The lens bends the light and changes its direction. Light shifts when it passes through different media. A drinking straw looks broken when seen in a glass of water. Lenses are used to form the image of light. In order to make the glass bend light properly, the edges are curved. Depending on the curvature of the edges, you can magnify or reduce the image by changing the direction of each ray of light. It is possible to change the focus. If the lens were purely square, it would be difficult to focus the whole image in the same way because the curve of the edges of the glass would not be the same everywhere. The film is square because it is easy to store in a square shape. Besides, if the image of the rectangle is familiar to people, they are also familiar with it. If you cut the negative, you can make it work, but a strip of film is most efficient in a long line of squares or rectangles. If you made a round film, the whole thing would be stuck in a cylinder. And it is inefficient in a small space.
The star is sending light in all directions, so some of the photons hit you, some of them reach your neighbour who is a few yards away. A star sends out a tremendous amount of light per second, so much that it remains visible even after being spread over millions of miles.
The angular momentum (the way stuff rotates around a particular point) is always conserved. In every sink, tub, or other vessel containing water, there’s a certain amount of random motion, and so the angular momentum in the vicinity of the drain is usually not zero. As the water drains, it approaches the center of the vessel, and to conserve the angular momentum, it has to go faster, like a skater who draws in his arms to accelerate his spin. It forms a spiral, because it increases its own spin as it moves toward the drain. It is theoretically possible for the water to go straight down, but practically speaking it is virtually impossible.
This is often seen on the videos of the rotation of the objects. The reason is that the speed of the recording frame of the video is often different from the speed of rotation of the object being recorded. For example, if the frame of the movie is made at 30 frames per second and the wheel rotates 30 times per second, then when the frame is made, the wheel will have already made a full revolution of the circle, and so the wheel in the movie seems to be slow. If the wheel rotates a little faster, like 30.1 times per second, then each frame of the movie will be recorded after the wheel has made a full turn, and so it will seem that the wheel is turning slowly. If the wheel rotates slower than the speed of the frame, then it will be recorded just before it makes a full turn compared to the previous frame. The same applies if the wheel rotates at 60 times per second. The wheel will rotate twice between two frames, but when the frame is taken, the wheel is in the same position as in the previous frame.
AM radios need only a very simple device to “demodulate” the sound—a rectifier. A bad rectifier circuit can sometimes be built quite by accident, for instance by touching two dissimilar metals or a metal and a conductive liquid. Even a mouthful of saliva can do it! If the radio signal is very strong, it can overcome the bad efficiencies of such circuits, causing them to vibrate like a speaker.
They're not really temperature, just color temperature. The color temperature is the result of using varying wavelengths of light.
Trucks are heavy. On downhill grades the trucks have to stop their heavy loads at the touch of a pedal, which means that the brakes heat up. But as they heat up, the brakes become less effective, so they need to be applied even longer, which means that they get even hotter, and so on. On a mountain road, this can result in the loss of the braking capacity, and the truck can go barreling down the mountain with no control. So a slope and some sand, built next to the road, is a small investment to prevent a possible death-dealing crash.
-It depends on what you mean by “time and space” and “have a beginning” and “have an end”. “Time and space” could be time, in the sense of human scale, and space as in a certain area or volume. It could also be time and space as a four-dimensional manifold. “Have a beginning” and “have an end” could be a time when a thing exists and when it does not exist (the verbs “to end” and “to begin”) or it could be physical or non-physical limits on a variable (nouns “end” and “beginning”). “Human scale time” cannot end because it is essentially a description of how fast certain things happen and how long it takes them to do it as many times as there are events. It cannot end because it is not a thing, it is an idea. A day is approximately the duration of radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of a caesium 133 atom. It will not end. It is a derivative of a frequency, not an intrinsic universal property. One can argue that it will have an end when there are no longer people to use it, and a beginning when the first people start measuring durations, but that is too philosophical, I think. Space, as an area or volume, can definitely have beginnings and ends, and that is the easiest one to understand. A football field has ends that are beginnings and vice versa, it is only the edge of the area. The observable universe has an end that is a beginning: the point where light has not yet had time to reach us, so that it is physically impossible for us to see and travel there. A football field can have an end and a beginning when it is torn down and built again. The observable universe has a beginning, in the sense of having started to exist, when the universe became transparent to CMB, and it could have an end, either by ceasing to exist or by something else making the whole area unobservable. Bigger black holes would do that (for aliens, their universe is different). The trickier interpretation is whether time and space has an end and a beginning and can time and space end and did time and space begin. No matter if the universe is flat, open or closed, it is probably spatially unlimited. See here for the wikipedia article on the shape of the universe. It means that it is impossible to travel to the end and the beginning of the universe, either because it would return to where it came from, or because it would travel a path that would not come back to itself, but only traversed a finite universe, or because it would not come back. The universe is not temporally unlimited, and that is where spacetime comes in. There is at least one limit on spacetime, and that is probably the Big Bang. So you have a four-dimensional manifold with a beginning on one of the dimensions. One of the faces of the infinite four-dimensional cube that is spacetime is located. This is the only face because the other sides are infinite. In three dimensions, it would be like you would make an infinite cube by adding an infinite line to five of its six sides. You can still find the sixth face, but do the other sides exist at all? But that dimension you are adding is not x, y, or z, it is time. Nevertheless, it gets even more difficult, because spacetime is a manifold that includes time, and time does not exist before 13.7 billion years ago, and there is no such thing as “time before the Big Bang”. It is completely senseless. The Big Bang is what started time. If you identified a time before, then immediately there was no longer a time before, because you needed time to define where (when?) you were in the manifold, and therefore you could not be talking about the past before there was spacetime. Thus, the beginning of spacetime is the beginning of spacetime, but there is no time at which that can be defined, except for the beginning itself, and it cannot be identified by a time in any way, that is, a time not relative to itself. Do you understand? No? Fine. Moving on... Spacetime could have an end, but we don’t know yet. There are some theories, such as the Big Rip, the Big Crunch, etc. But, for the same reasons as the beginning, saying when it will end makes little sense. It will end when it ends. The best you can do is predict the duration of the universe according to its own axis, but since spacetime will no longer exist, there will be no where or when to observe and measure that end. Besides, the progression of time is not the same in all parts of the universe. It depends on what happens, so you will have to choose, and it will be almost impossible to do, what scale of duration you will use. In conclusion, “time like on a clock” is a scale. “To end” and “to begin” are meaningless for it. Space like your backyard is spatially limited. Perhaps it has a beginning, and maybe it has an end. When it became your backyard and if it ceases to be your backyard, it began and it may end. It has a beginning and an end, but it is only a continuous edge, not one or the other. Spacetime began and had a beginning in the – time direction. It may end and have an end, but we don’t know. It would be meaningless to say “when” these events happened/were/will happen, because you would have to define them relative to themselves, and this is still meaningless. It’s like saying: “Where are my keys?” “They’re in the same place as your keys.” [I’m not making this clear enough, but it is important to remember that time is not the same as duration, time that passes, or time that has passed. Time can be defined by a single number, but duration must be defined by at least two.]
We know very well what electricity is; electricity is the transmission of power through the motion of electric charges. The context of the text, and the general tone of the lecture make it clear that the speaker means: “Most people have wrong notions about how electricity works.”
Because it turns out that the train analogy is wrong. Speeds do not add up in this way, only in the sense that the error of such an addition is insignificant in most everyday situations. The train analogy is a piece of popular science that is not a physics law. The fact is that it does not matter how fast you go or in which direction you go. Light always propagates in a vacuum with a speed of 'c', neither more nor less. There is an extremely famous experiment that proved this to be true. [Edit: about the train analogy: let's say you're on a train going at X miles per hour and you fire a gun in the same direction the train is going with a muzzle speed of Y miles per hour.] At the moment you fire the gun, you pass a person standing on the ground outside the train. Both of you now see the bullet moving in the same direction as the train. You see the bullet go at Y miles per hour relative to you, and the person standing on the ground sees you go at X miles per hour relative to him, but he does not see the bullet go at X+Y miles per hour relative to him, but the speed of the bullet relative to the standing observer is strictly less than X+Y, regardless of the speed of the two observers, and the faster the velocities involved, the more the error of the addition of the speeds. At the extreme case (i.e., the bullet is fired at a speed equal to the speed of light), you and the person standing on the ground both see the bullet propagate at the same speed, which is 'c'.
Because air is pretty light. If you have a small air compresser with a capacity of twenty liters, the air in the tank will weigh, say, 25 grams at a pressure of fifteen pounds, which is not much. If you turn on the compresser and make it operate at fifteen pounds, which means fifteen pounds over atmospheric pressure, i.e. 15 PSI, it now weighs an extra 25 grams. You don't have to worry about the 15 pounds pressure as indicated by the pressure gauge because it's internal pressure and only applies to the walls of the tank, not to the force you need to lift it. If you turn up the pressure to 150 PSI (pretty high for a home garage), the tank now has eleven times as much air in it and weighs an extra 225 grams, which isn't much. Now let's assume you get yourself a real high-pressure compresser that you can put together with your tiny tank, and it gets up to 3,000 PSI. You now have 200 times as much air in the same volume, so the tank weighs an extra 2.2 kilograms, which is a fair amount. This is a critical point for diving tanks because the more air you use underwater, the lighter you become, gradually improving your buoyancy.
Firstly, splitting an atom isn’t dangerous at all, it gives off a negligible amount of energy, you wouldn’t even notice it, and indeed it would be very difficult to detect even if we wanted to. But the thing about radioactivity and atomic reactions is that it’s not a question of splitting one atom, but splitting a whole heap of them all at once. When you split a thousand billion atoms in a split-second the amount of energy that is liberated is enormous, and this is what makes atomic reactions so dangerous.
Are you referring to films of engines running on the dyno? Cameras have a rate of frames per second. Usually, 30 frames per second. So they take a picture every 1/30th of a second. These are then rapidly run back, and you get a film. Imagine a wheel with six spokes. If it makes one turn of one sixth of a turn per 1/30th of a second, it appears not to turn at all. Of course, it turns, but the spokes remain in the same positions, and so you see no change. If it speeds up, and turns a little more than one sixth of a turn per 1/30th of a second, each successive picture of the wheel will have the positions of the spokes slightly displaced. It will appear to be slowly moving forwards. Now, let it speed up, and it will turn a little less than two sixths of a turn per 1/30th of a second. If it were exactly two sixths, it would appear to be standing still again, but it is a little slower, and so the frames per 1/30th of a second are slightly less than two sixths. This means it will appear to be turning backwards. Of course, this is only a camera effect. You cannot observe it with your own eyes and a fixed light source. Fluorescent lights flash at 50 or 60 cycles. In effect, they are a high-speed strobe light.
They are wrong. The gravitation is there in the Earth’s orbit, which is why the moon keeps orbiting around us and doesn’t go into space. In the ISS and other orbital spacecraft, the spacecraft and everything inside them moves so fast that they experience microgravity, because the gravity of the Earth pulls on them, the air and everything else in the same way. It keeps the whole system in the orbit and gives the impression (from outside the spacecraft) that people are floating without gravity. No gravity.
Those massive speakers are very directional because sound travels so slowly. So you want the audience to only hear the sound of one of the speakers, because a speaker that's ten meters farther away will lag by a tenth of a second. In a large sports stadium, the speakers on the far side of the stadium are significantly delayed and that causes the sound to lag a lot, which makes the sound very distorted. But low-frequency sound (bass) cannot be controlled, at least not with speakers that are practical. The wavelength of the bass is so long that you'd need a gigantic speaker to be able to control the direction. So you hear bass from all over the place and you can hear the bass from the far speakers, but they're noticeably late.
You have thrusters, tiny little rockets (or sometimes you just blow high-pressure gas) on the side of the ship. The reason gravity doesn't work in space is that there's no air for aerodynamic surfaces like ailerons and rudders to operate against.
it does not run out, but it can lose its inclination. Imagine a large magnet as a number of millions of small magnets, each with its own inclination. If you jumble up their orientation, the magnet loses its power, but as soon as you realign them, the magnet regains its power. This is why we can magnetize the steel.
mirror images are neither flipped horizontally nor vertically. They are reversed along the front-back axis. Stand in front of a mirror and point left or right (horizontally) or up or down (vertically), and your reflection will point in the same direction. Point towards or away from the mirror and you and your reflection will suddenly point in opposite directions.
Diametrically opposite ends. A thing has to turn a certain number of times, no matter what size the two ends are. But the fat end will cover a greater distance in a given number of revolutions.
Water is not "heavier." If you have any substance in a completely sealed container, then freeze it, melt it, evaporate it, condense it, etc., then the weight remains the same. Ice is less dense, because when it freezes (the ordinary way we know it — there are other strange kinds of water that occur under special conditions) it takes on a crystalline structure that increases its volume. Same mass divided by increased volume = less density. Ice floats on water because of this lower density.
There is something called the fire triangle, and the three legs of the triangle are oxygen, heat, and fuel. If any of these three elements are absent or unavailable, the triangle falls, and the fire goes out. If the wind is strong enough, then although the fire has oxygen, the wind cools it off more quickly than the fire can heat up. Fire is just a chemical reaction, and the reaction rate is fixed, so the heat rate is also fixed.
Because the vehicle has springs. When the brakes are applied, the vehicle’s weight transfers to the front, increasing the force on the front wheels. When the weight is no longer applied as you slow down, the remaining energy stored in the springs is suddenly released, causing a brief, sharp shock. This is partially reduced by the shock absorbers, but it is still a shock resulting from something like two thousand pounds on the front wheels. During a coasting maneuver, there is no weight transfer, and the car is losing energy through friction alone. The springs aren’t being charged, and there is no release of energy when you finally come to a stop.
Water has a particularly good absorption of infrared radiation, and as the human skin is composed of a large proportion of water, we are well adapted to feeling infrared heat.
We can do that, and there are various ways to produce a high quality industrial carbon dioxide. The problem is the cost and the fact that it has to be done in such a way that it is enough to make a difference. The common way to just catch CO2 is adsorption: a tank is filled with a special material that absorbs CO2, and then high-pressure air is pumped into this tank to fill the material with CO2. The air is then released, the material is heated, and it is again released with high-quality CO2 that is used to produce, for example, sparkling water. This works very well for several hundred tons of CO2, but meanwhile about 30 billion tons of CO2 are emitted annually in industry and electricity production, so you have to make energy again if you want to get O2 and C, for example. How much energy? Not less than was emitted when it was CO2 in the first place, and then you must now use fossil fuels and produce CO2 to catch and sort less CO2 than you have just released? This does not work very well. Plants do it by catching light from millions of square kilometers and using it as a source of energy for their reactions. We can also build huge solar cells (and we are working on that) but it is usually easier to just plant trees and let them do their job. Until we get fusion up and running and profitable, it is of course not possible to capture CO2 because it all only works with the energy of fossil fuels, which also reduces the effect.
Because at the temperature where people live, everything is infrared and this glow rises rapidly as the temperature rises. If our temperature were higher, everything would be in the visible range, as can be seen when heating a piece of high melting-point metal which, beginning as dull red, turns bright white.
From what I read on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_time), it seems that in order to model certain phenomena, it is necessary to use imaginary or complex numbers, rather than real numbers to represent time. It is a bit like owing money before there was a special system of negative numbers: it is very clear that one owes ten units of something, but the positive number system cannot express it and so a special system of negative numbers must be used.
They are very often put into orbit. SpaceX for example can sometimes send up a couple of satellites every month.
cobwebs are made of spider silk, a soft, strong, pliant, silky substance produced by spiders for the purpose of catching prey and building their nests. The term “cobweb” is often used in the context of an old, perhaps dusty abandoned web.
To evaporate a liquid you need to have an equal pressure inside and outside the liquid. A lid will raise the pressure, but you can't make it evaporate. But water evaporates even when its pressure is lower, because it absorbs energy from its environment, which excites the molecules, and the water at the surface separates from the rest and turns into steam.
The Manhattan project suffered from the same basic problem as we do today: if the bomb explodes, the bomb should also have enough time to develop a critical mass, so that the chain reaction develops. So the question is: how can one pack a whole bunch of plutonium in a tight sphere that will explode? The yield is increased by slowing down the explosion and letting the bomb last longer. But even so, some of the plutonium will fly out of the bomb before it has time to go critical, so that the theoretical yield is less than 100 percent. And even then the yield will not be 100 percent, unless one assumes that the technology has advanced sufficiently to stabilize the core of the bomb for the critical period.
Nope. If you go to a grocery store in Estes Park, CO (elevation 4,400 m), the chip packets are properly inflated.
It is strange, but hard in this sense does not mean indestructible. It means only that it is difficult to scratch, or, better still, that it can’t be scratched by something less hard. Glass may be an example. You can rub it against a piece of wood without scratching it, yet you can break it if you throw the wood at it. The wood is “less hard” than the glass because it does not scratch it. Similarly you can scratch glass with your fingernail, which is harder than glass, but you cannot break it with a nail. Hardness in this sense does not imply indestructibility, but merely that it is difficult to scratch. Diamonds are so hard that they can’t be scratched by almost anything else, yet they can be cut or broken.
Basically, it's a different mechanism. In a conventional bulb, the wire heats up and produces light by what we call "black-body radiation": in other words, the atoms in the wire vibrate very quickly, and this vibration is what we see as light. In an LED, a different mechanism is used: the electricity pushes the free electrons over a certain barrier, and when they are over, they return to normal and give off light. Like pushing a rock over a mountain. It is therefore almost impossible to make wire bulbs that are not orange / yellow, since high temperatures are needed, which are harmful to materials or people around them. But with LEDs, since nothing gets hot, you just have to find the right material and the right "mountain height" to get the right color.
It does me, too. But I suspect it’s because I drink beer, and I urinate a lot of salt, besides using up my body heat warming up the cold pints. But the best thing about alcohol is that it poisons you—it’s a poison, really. It’s a combination of methanol and ethyl alcohol, the deadly poison.
In a collision with a wall, all the energy of the collision is absorbed by the interior structures of the car, which is the real source of damage. In a collision between two (identical) cars, the total energy is greater, but it is distributed evenly between two sets of identical structures. It goes without saying that this may not apply to non-identical cars.
The more massive an object is, the more it bends spacetime around it. [Visualize this here]
I suppose you mean magnetic flux density. For example, the Earth’s magnetic field is great in the sense that it covers the whole planet, but its flux density is small enough so that iron objects do not always point north. The unit of magnetic flux density for a single, uniform magnetic field is the gauss or the tesla. 1 tesla = 10,000 gauss. It is difficult to say how strong that is because it depends on the size and shape of the magnet being measured. However, if your refrigerator somehow produced a magnetic field of one tesla, a magnet of one centimeter would weigh two or three kilograms. The magnetic strength of a permanent magnet with a definite north and south pole is measured in units of the earth meter per gram.
Everything keeps moving in a straight line unless you bother it. A pendulum swings back and forth. A nice and simple operation; you lift it up, you let it go, and it swings back and forth, straight, and this will continue to be so forever (unless friction gets in the way). Imagine placing a pendulum (with a frame) on a turntable, like a microwave oven (do not do it at home!) ; if it is freely suspended, there is nothing to turn it, and the pendulum will go on going back and forth as the turntable turns. This is what Foucault did in 1851: he hung a large pendulum from the ceiling of the Pantheon in Paris (removed soon after, and restored for a while in the nineties). As time went on, the pendulum seemed to be spinning. But the pendulum should not spin. If it doesn't spin, it must be that the earth is spinning, and the pendulum is standing still! And it is a very regular, a very foreseeable operation, so much so that you can use these pendulums as clocks by looking at the apparent rotation of the pendulum.
If you heat your house with electricity to drive induction heaters, then the electricity to run your appliances costs the same. If you have another heating system which involves an electric heat pump, then it costs less to run appliances than to use the heat pump. I assume that all other heating systems are more energy efficient than electricity. From an environmental point of view, it depends on how your electricity is generated compared with the other heating sources. Even if you heat with electricity, the heat pump will be better for the environment.
Beer is a gaseous liquid; that is to say, it contains a quantity of carbonic acid gas dissolved in it beyond the limits of its capacity to hold it. This carbonic acid gas escapes slowly and in time will exhaust itself; but under ordinary conditions this does not take place immediately. When you strike a beer bottle the bottle is very rapidly depressed; but the liquid within it is not depressed at the same speed. This creates a vacuum under the liquid. This vacuum causes the carbonic acid gas dissolved in the liquid to precipitate very rapidly, which assists in the process of filling the void. When the liquid actually falls down, the carbonic acid forms many bubbles, which are in fact only gaseous clumps in the liquid, and this causes the sudden foaming. A popular street trick to break bottles is to do the same thing with a bottle of water instead of with a bottle of beer.
If the screeching is only when the hot water is being used, the fault is most likely only in the hot water piping or faucet parts. Either the stem valve or the washer is loose or something is caught inside the hot water pipe. Another possibility is a stretching of the hot water pipes. The expansion of hot water entering the pipe stretches it. The metal pipe stretches against the metal clamps, which makes a short screeching sound. The clamps and the metal pipes should be replaced.

simplified version: electricity running through the wires creates a magnetic field. But it works in reverse, too. A moving magnetic field can create electricity in the wires. A strong solar storm is a large amount of charged material moving quite fast for us. There are also very strong magnetic fields spinning in that mass. Sometimes these storms can be detached from the sun and come to our planet. The earth has its own magnetic field which creates the Van Allen belts. This usually protects us from the electrical, magnetic, and radiational energy of the sun. But if the storm is strong enough, it can overcome the Van Allen belts and reach the surface of the earth. When this happens, every wire on the planet converts some of this energy into electricity in the wire. The more powerful the storm, the more electricity is created in the wire. Most of the appliances can’t handle this additional electricity. They are destroyed by the additional power. Our electric grid consists of millions of miles of wires, which are great collectors of solar energy. So you can have blown transformers, fried generators, and so on.
Flowers dry out over time. The flower is flexible because of the humidity, the humidity evaporates and the rigid, fragile fibers remain. Pressed by the book, it dries flat and stays flat.
The expansion of high pressure air (or any air) brings down its pressure and temperature. The water vapor in the air condenses as the temperature drops. This is the same process that creates a cloud.
I’ll explain this by using an analogy with boats. On flat water, a boat moves straight forward. But if you add waves, the boat moves up and down, or left and right. Well, an aircraft doesn’t move on water, it flies in the air. In fact, it floats on air thanks to the lift provided by its wings. So if the air is calm, the aircraft will fly in a straight line. But if the air is disturbed (in other words, imagine a wave rolling over: that’s what air turbulence is). Now the aircraft isn’t harmed by turbulence, it’s designed to cope with much more powerful turbulence than it encounters. But if you’re in the aircraft when it’s being jolted, you might fall and hurt yourself. So that’s why we’re asking you to stay seated and fasten your seatbelts!
Entropy is a thermodynamic quantity that measures the degree of disorder or randomness of a physical system. It's like having a jar full of small balls; if you throw it on the ground, there will be a lot of disorder, because that's the way the universe goes, it keeps increasing that disorder. If you want to rearrange the small balls, you must provide energy to the system (to decrease the disorder). In other words, to act against the trend of entropy, you must provide energy, otherwise the universe tends to decompose everything.
They are usually fastened with Velcro fasteners so that objects can be stuck on them so they do not float and harm machines or people.
One of the theories that I was told about is that people with mental disabilities don't have the neural signal to their muscles that tells them, "Stop, more than this will hurt you. " The other theory is that the young boys' hypothalamus may be firing all the time. In any case, both theories explain the phenomenon.
Imagine two interacting conditions, pressure and temperature. At a given pressure, the more likely the hydrogen is to be a gas. But, at a given pressure, the more likely it is to be a liquid or a supercritical fluid, regardless of temperature. The temperature and pressure at the core of Jupiter are such that liquid hydrogen is possible. What is wrong is to assume that all liquids have less energy than gases. A liquid at high pressure and temperature can have more energy than a gas at low pressure and temperature.
In a closed system without any external forces (that is, the angler is holding the rod and the fish is pulling the line with its own weight) then the tension in the line is equal to the fish's pulling power. The drag can be adjusted so that the line can only be pulled in when the tension in the line is above a certain point. In practice, the tension in the line is a little higher because you also pull the rod back/strip it. Then the tension in the line is how much you pull back plus how much the fish pulls away. It is therefore so easy to break a line when the drag is too high, because the line is not allowed to be pulled out and the sum of the forces is greater than the line can withstand. A bit of extra tension stuff:... assuming the string is massless (which is reasonable for a fishing line) and that the tension is constant throughout the string. In practice, if the string or rope has some measurable mass, then the tension will vary depending on the mass and how gravity acts on it. So, for example, if a rope was hanging and a weight was hanging on the end of it, then the tension in the end of the rope was just the weight of the rope at the end. In the middle, the tension is the lower half of the rope plus the weight. At the top, it is the weight of the rope and the whole weight. If it is falling, there is an even greater tension. It is even more complicated when the mass is not distributed evenly.
A number of things. * The chemical bonds between the atoms and molecules in the substance must release energy when they break. Some types of chemical bonds require you to put energy into them before they can break, and that’s usually bad for burning. * * * The substance must have at least one atom or molecule that is attracted to oxygen. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Photons have no rest mass, but that doesn't mean they have no mass (or, more precisely, energy) in the sense of special relativity. Mass and energy are just two aspects of the same thing (I'll refer to this thing as "energy" from now on, but in the context of special relativity, this "energy" is the thing that creates gravity). You might be familiar with the formula E=mc2, but that only applies to a particle at rest (which a proton is never at rest). The full formula is E2 = mc2 + pc2, where m is the rest mass (if any), c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum. For a photon, m=0. But photons do have momentum (p=h/h), so the energy and the mass of a photon aren't zero and they can be affected by gravity like anything else. Or to put it another way, since the energy of a photon isn't zero, its gravitational mass isn't zero. In other words, it's not just that photons feel gravity, they produce it themselves. Now the gravitational mass of a photon is so small that it's effectively negligible compared to any particle with a rest mass. A photon of visible light has an energy of about 0.44 x 10-19 J, while the rest mass-energy of an electron is about 0.08 x 10-14 J, which is 200,000 times larger. Moreover, this isn't the whole story. In special relativity, mass-energy isn't the only thing that creates gravitational fields. The fundamental source of gravitational fields, the stress-energy tensor, is also affected by the momentum of mass-energy.
No, it’s usually best to think of it as a kind of displacement. Then, there’s a certain amount of physical displacement from a more stable position which ‘stores’ energy until it is released. Imagine a spring which you have squeezed. Its metal atoms are displaced from their most stable arrangement, and there’s a strain on them from their own alternating electric and magnetic forces which are trying to restore their equilibrium. Now imagine a stone which you have lugged to the top of Everest; it is displaced several thousand metres from its equilibrium position in the gravity well of the Earth. A push from below immediately transforms its energy into kinetic energy. But if you put it back down, the repulsion between the rocks and their electrical charge will resist; but the potential to fall still exists.
It's either naive or dishonest, probably both. He thinks his reason is more powerful than what he sees, and that's wrong. There are infinitesimally many infinites (see Georg Cantor and set theory), but the important part is that they can be divided into convergent and divergent. Cauchy gave us a formula for determining whether a series converges or diverges. In short, an infinite series can converge to a finite number. To dismiss it as 'only a theory' is a form of minimization that no mathematician or physicist would allow to his field of study.
The people who testify that we did not know what we were doing are 100 percent wrong. People who made and tested atomic bombs from the 40s to the 60s knew that they would create toxic substances, that they would be released into the air and would inevitably end up in the environment, in the food chain, and in human bodies. They knew this even before they had tested the first bomb, it was an inevitable consequence of how the bomb works (splitting the atom, in turn, means generating highly radioactive products). So why did they do it? They thought — on the basis of very limited evidence — that, if they tested them far enough from people, when radioactive poisons got into the human food chain, they would be sufficiently diluted that they would not cause significant harm. But that does not mean that they did not do any harm. (It's a matter of opinion.) The only difference was that they were so small that it would be difficult to prove, and therefore it was the same as saying that it was not important. If you know that what you do will probably kill thousands of people in the future, but you do not know who they are, and that it will never be possible to prove that it is your fault, are you a murderer or not? This question is much deeper than it seems at first sight, because we do a lot of things today that we know will be bad for people, but where we are so far removed from the immediate consequences that we generally do not feel any responsibility. The uncertainty was how poisonous it was, and the people who tested the atomic bombs assumed that it would not be so bad, whereas we might say in hindsight that it might be worse until it was proven wrong. In any case, the risk of not having a good knowledge of the atomic bomb was much more dangerous than the danger of the danger of its tests. If it is a matter of a large-scale atomic test or a atomic war, the former is probably less harmful than the latter. That's how the people who made the atomic bomb saw the choice in the early cold war — whether they were right or not. (Not everyone thought so.) All this led to the logic that it was better to test, even if it was poisonous, than not to test. Over time, not everyone agreed with this reasoning. – Already in the early sixties, the amount of radioactivity in the air and in people's bodies from the tests had reached a size that could be measured (but not the health consequences of it, it's very easy to measure small doses, it's much harder to prove that they are dangerous). So it was so frightening that the US and the USSR, the two countries that tested the most bombs, agreed on a treaty that they would only test underground. That does not create radioactive poisons, if it is done properly. Some countries still tested in the air for a few years (France and China), because underground tests put a limit on the size of the test (it is difficult to test large bombs under ground, because it requires digging deep holes). But they finally signed up too. Today we know, based on careful studies from the sixties and later, that the atmospheric bombs affected the health of people in the immediate vicinity of the explosion ("downwinders"), and probably caused a small increase in cancer in the entire area of the tests (in the hemisphere as a whole), but even a very small increase in the number of deaths from cancer when you have a large number of people who are exposed adds up to a large number of people (tens of thousands of deaths from cancer). Even then it is difficult to prove that the cancer of the downwinders was caused by the tests, because cancer does not have a label saying what caused it, and several things can cause cancer, but if you look at groups of people, you can compare their cancer rate with the general population and find that there are sharp differences. But it is very difficult to estimate the increased cancer risk in the whole hemisphere, because even if there were a large number of additional cancers (maybe up to 100,000 over the whole twentieth century), it is compared to millions of other cancers that were occurring every year. So this is more theoretical.
Air pressure. Wind. When the outside air pressure is lower than the pressure inside, the air rushes out the window, and since the door is open, the air has a short path to travel, between the frame and the glass, and since the door is open, it carries air from outside into the room, and because the door is open, it carries the door along with it. Then the pressure equalizes somewhat, so the door closes. And it happens again. I’m used to it. I’m in the habit of leaving my window open, but I leave the door open, too.
I would travel until the universe ended. There is a bubble around us, called the Hubble volume, where space is currently expanding faster than light. This you could never leave, so even with infinite time you would never reach the edge of the universe, if such a thing exists. You would stay within the confines of the observable universe.
It isn't a single point. Gravity in orbit is almost as strong as on earth, but they and the ship they're in are moving together rather than the ship holding them up, and even if the ship were to disappear, the crew would still go around in the same orbit. Since they can't feel the weight of their bodies, it feels like weightlessness. When they slow down for reentry, they feel the deceleration of the ship, but except during the burn of the engines, they and the ship are still going together. Until they enter the atmosphere, when the ship decelerates and they don't because of air resistance, they can't feel the effects of gravity. However, if the ship gains speed, they feel the effects of gravity, but they have to experience it. For the space shuttle, this occurs near the end of the descent, when the air is thick enough to support the wings. For a rocket that lands without gliding (not in use for passenger transportation), they feel it during the burn of the engines to land.
Light is a form of energy; photons are particles of light, but since they are massless particles, they have momentum but no mass. Therefore light has no mass.
Here's an example. Say you have a choice between eating toast or cereal for breakfast. There are two alternate realities: the one where you eat the toast and the other where you eat the cereal. Now each of those alternate realities has its own associated alternate time lines, and the events in those alternate time lines are the things that happen because you eat the toast or the cereal. You might drop the cereal bowl while pouring the milk, which makes you late for work, and so on. The alternate time lines contain the past, present and future of the alternate realities, while the alternate realities are the present as it were.
Bah! it’s calculated. It’s built to scale. Steel beams, girders, structural members have a known volume and density. So also concrete which is poured; the makers know the dimensions of the work and the density of the material. They calculate the weight, it’s a matter of simple arithmetic. A standard material like plaster-board flooring has a standard weight per unit area. Glass for the windows can be calculated, also in terms of weight per unit area. When you are talking about thousands of tons, you don’t have to worry about a few pounds or ounces.
Almost all waterjets used to cut metals are mixed with abrasive material (basically sandpaper grits). They don't cut metals, but sand them down really fast. But that's basically just a lot of tiny cuts happening really fast. The waterjet is very high pressure (thousands of pounds per square inch). This is already higher than the yield strength of some softer materials, and waterjet can cut them by itself by pushing the material out of the way.
Normally if you accelerate you're pulled back into your seat. But for most of the flight the spaceship is not accelerating (that is, not nearly so much)—thus it is “falling” with the Astronauts inside. And for the vast majority of the time, the thrusters were off.
A. There is nothing to slow them down, and once they are launched they can go on going without fueling. There is no difficulty in launching a spacecraft; and once launched it can go on going indefinitely. B. Not all systems of spacecraft propulsion depend on combustion. To propel a spacecraft a propeller is needed. Energy is needed to propel a propeller. Combustion is a convenient method, because the result of combustion is both momentum and energy. And the combination makes a very good engine for propulsion in space. But there are other systems, which are better adapted to other circumstances. For example, it is possible to convert sunlight into electricity and then use that electricity to launch xenon atoms at incredible speeds. This is much more efficient and does not require oxygen. C. Spacecraft which depend on oxygen take it with them. This is merely another form of fuel. Tanks are required for oxygen (usually kept in a liquid state to save space), and for fuel. The fuel can be either kerosene or liquid hydrogen.
In Freud’s theory, Freud recognized three parts of the unconscious, which develop at different stages of childhood. The ego is a part that tries to mediate between the other two (superego and id) in order to prevent anxiety. It mediates by reason and prudence when it comes to desires and behavior, thinking about the expected consequences and making decisions based on them, and by doing so to find a decision that will be acceptable to all parts of the brain. The ego tries to find a decision when, for example, you find a wallet full of money, and the id wants to take it and use it, and the superego wants to give it to the police. This can lead to anxiety, and the ego asks questions such as: "Is anyone watching me? " How much money is there? How bad do I need it? " And similar questions that push the unconscious to the id or superego and that way to a decision. In other cases, where the situation is not so easily solved, the ego uses other coping strategies to deal with anxiety, such as repressing memories, transferring unacceptable feelings to acceptable objects, and finding the same unwanted desires in other people. These defensive tactics were, in Freud's opinion, very useful for the study of the unconscious of his patients.
A huge metal bird is not meant to smash into the ground. The soft human inside cannot endure such forces.
Watch what happens when you throw a stone into a pond. The waves move, expand and dissipate. Sounds are like that, you can't see them. But sound travels by putting its energy into a surface. And like water waves, sound cannot travel infinitely through a surface because it loses its energy on its way. The more dense the surface the more energy is taken out, like yelling into a pillow, which almost goes nowhere.
We can't, we just use lots of factors like composition, activity, temperature, etc. to "guess" what it might sound like.
it happens all the time because hydrogen is plentiful, and is continually struck by the photons flying around in space. The photon strikes the hydrogen, it excites an electron, which then de-excites and emits a photon, which is detected.
It is not natural for things to get cold when they are stretched out. It so happens that most gases do get cold under the conditions prevailing on earth, but that is no guarantee, and even on earth it is not universal (hydrogen and helium get warmer when they are stretched out at room temperature). The explanation of this cooling is a rather complicated one, and relates to the attractive and repulsive forces between the atoms. Atoms are repulsive near to each other and attractive at a distance, and the energy of a gas changes depending on whether its atoms are near or far apart. If they are mainly repulsive, then stretching out the gas changes the repulsive energy into the energy of motion, and so the gas gets warmer. If they are mainly in the attractive zone, then stretching out the gas makes the atoms move apart, which consumes energy and cools the gas. (Ideal gases have neither attractive nor repulsive forces, and they neither heat up nor cool down when they are stretched out, and so cooling is an example of the fact that real gases are not really ideal, even if they are a good model in many respects.) In practice, under normal conditions on earth, the atoms of gases are mostly in the attractive zone, and therefore they cool when they are stretched out.
The electric drive has no clutch or a pop. It can deliver a lot of power without the wheels slipping. It’s not so much about horsepower as the even power output from 0 to maximum RPM without the need for gears or shifts.
Time is the ability of the universe to be potential, to change its state or the state of anything of which it is composed.
Newton's second law of motion says: A force F on an object with mass m will cause an acceleration a. In other words, F = ma. So if you accept that F=gm and that g*m * a is equal to g*m*a, you are saying that a=g*m*a or simply a = g. In other words, if you remove the mass term you get: "gravity makes objects accelerate at 9.81 m/s"
It comes from the matter. E = mc2 is well known, which means that the masses of the particles are converted into pure energy.
Yes, it is a closed system, provided that the ship itself is a closed system. The difficult part is getting rid of the heat since the radiators cannot be cooled with air. Here's how it's actually done on the ISS:
The universe is expanding. Nothing can move faster than the speed of light, but the expansion of space is not constrained by the speed of light. During the early stages of the expansion, light from the apex of the universe was able to reach us, but now that part of the universe is much farther away from us and so the light that is now generated there will never reach us.
This is a navigational officer from a large company that operates seagoing ships. Some of the other answers are pure conjecture or just plain wrong, sorry to say. There are many things in concert that make it less likely they will topple over. The most important are the loading pattern, the ISO container, twist-locks, and lashings. The loading pattern: The heaviest containers are loaded in the lower half of the van. The upper one is usually empty, because of many reasons. (The top one is usually empty on the way to Asia, and going to Europe, it is usually empty because it is a refrigerator container.) There are also water ballast tanks that help lower the center of gravity. The center of gravity is the target value and is calculated by a complex program that uses the weight of the containers and other things. The ISO container: Today we mainly use 20', 40' and 45' containers. There are some other formats, mostly the 53' American rail, and a somewhat wider European van, but I don't know much about them. All containers built to the ISO standard have corners at exact points and sizes, and minimum strength. These are basically the most important points. When you look inside the ship, only 20' containers are stacked with the help of a cone stacker (or side-mounted stacker that is placed from the pier), before 40' containers are stacked on top of them. On deck, all are connected with twist-locks, to the container on top and bottom. There are different types of twist-locks, mainly the bottom one, which is wider at the bottom and therefore stronger. The rest are normally manual, semi-manual or automatic twist-locks. All of them basically work the same, but there is only one type on board the ship. The equipment is also part of the ship. Lashings: Lashings are usually placed between two layers of containers on most ships. On modern supermax ships, they are usually used on three levels. If you have had an accident and been able to investigate, you will usually find that it is either improperly or incorrectly lashed (with twist-locks in place), or the sender has given the wrong weights, so that a heavy container on top can be more easily tilted and turned. Maybe not ELI5 material, but feel free to ask follow-up questions. Edit: To all the good people who have given me the award: Thanks... Especially the gold medal!
Really we don’t know. But the general theory is that as an object accelerates, it requires more and more energy to continue accelerating. This is definitely true on Earth, and so far it seems to be true in a vacuum; the mathematics show that for an object with mass to reach the speed of light, an infinite amount of energy is required. As with all theoretical arguments involving infinity, it’s possible we’re wrong. However, experiments on sub-atomic particles in particle accelerators have never been able to reach the speed of light. They have been close — 99.99999999%—but each step closer requires much more energy. So, assuming that infinite energy is required, we say that travelling faster than light using only acceleration is impossible. However, it’s possible that a Star Trek or Futurama-style warp drive might be possible, where the space in front of the object is compressed. So that a spaceship travelling at less than light speed can cover more distance. This would get around the speed limit.
It is a way of formulating the flow principle, in particular in fluid mechanics. It is a notoriously difficult area of study, and it is not unusual for the first person to prove only one or two results before winning the million-dollar prize. Your friend is right to say that engineering is hard. But he's a dumb guy who gave the hardest possible answer.
Well, I'm no physicist, but I do know that air friction is at work around the puck, which is why it doesn't go on indefinitely.
The fan is spinning so fast that the refresh rate of your eyes has been exceeded. So, your eyes start to juggle the image going forward and backward, because they don't have enough information to stabilize it in one direction.
No it is not. The centrifugal acceleration is a1 / r2; the force is smaller when the circle is wider. A2 / r2   v2 / r2 = (r )2  r2  v2  r2  v2  r2  r2  v2  r2 So if you drive your car around a curve, the centrifugal force is smaller when the radius increases, but on a merry-go-round the centrifugal force is greater at the outer edge. The outer parts of the merry-go-round are moving much faster!
What you call "electromotive force" is an old-fashioned concept from the time when we thought electricity was some kind of liquid and supposedly this force was supposed to push the liquid through the wires. Today we still call the emf in circuits "electromotive force," not because it's actually a force, but because it's conventional. Electromotive force is the potential energy that a charged particle would lose if it went from one side of the circuit to the other. It is also called "voltage. " This emf is measured in units of energy per charge, such as volts, joules per coulomb, etc. (In principle, there is a difference between emf and voltage, but for most practical purposes and for the purpose of this explanation, they are almost the same.) The emf, on the other hand, is the force that separates magnets and pulls the hair off your head when you rub balloons together. It is the real force (in newtons or pounds, if you don't want to use metric) that acts on magnets and charged particles. And it is the emf that creates the emf in the circuit. An electric particle moving in the direction of the emf will lose its emf and its voltage will change, which is called the emf in the circuit. * In the last section I said that you measure the emf in joules, which is obviously wrong. You measure it in volts. I've corrected it.
Black holes and neutron stars are, to begin with, both massive atomic phenomena. But we don't know enough about these objects to be able to test the unknown. In essence, quantum mechanics is the best tested theory we have.
I want you to imagine you are trying to colour all the water in a hosepipe. The colour would only get into the water at the end, but it would never get up the hosepipe. That’s what happens with fire.
If you close the window halfway, half the energy of the sound waves will enter the reverberant room. An accurate meter would reveal this. And it doesn’t seem half as loud? The human brain is a completely nonlinear processing system. The purpose of hearing is to pick up small noises that might warn you of danger. This is the same as amplification with a preamplifier. It turns the sound up and you can still hear the music.
Who's so excited? Most of the people I talked to thought it was just a waste of resources for some useless entertainment.
The earth is constantly falling toward the sun, but at the same time it is also moving sideways very, very fast, so that it is always able to miss the sun by flying past it. That's the way it works with all gravitational orbits. If our planet's motion to the side were suddenly to stop, it would just fall straight into the sun, but since it is moving sideways at a speed that is nearly constant, it never actually hits the sun. A good illustration of how the orbit works can be found here. If you stand on a high tower and fire a gun, the bullet will fly forward but it will be pulled back by gravity and it will hit the ground. If you fire a bigger gun, the bullet will go faster and fall further before gravity brings it back down. If you fire a still bigger gun, the bullet will go even faster and go around the earth before being brought back down by gravity. The earth is that bullet, it is falling toward the sun and moving sideways at a speed that is so great that it always flies past the sun.
Light is a wave traveling through the electric and magnetic fields. When the frequency of that wave changes, the color changes. It is exactly the same as with sound: If the frequency increases, the pitch goes up and the color of light goes to blue; if the frequency decreases, the pitch goes down and the color goes to red. The frequency of a wave is the number of cycles per second.
Light moves with a fixed speed in a vacuum, but in a dense medium such as the atmosphere of the earth it is a little deflected by the interaction with matter. They know the speed of light by going backwards. The speed of light is defined by Einstein's theory of special relativity, and this limit is precisely 186,223, which is a mouthful, so it is called c. But the trouble is that nothing that has mass can reach this speed, so c is only a theoretical speed that no object can achieve. Light has no mass and can reach this speed in a vacuum, so light speed is c. If you multiply c by 3,154,000 (the number of seconds in a year) you get a very big and ugly number of meters, and we call it 1 light year.
In the process of developing the atomic bomb, the main effort was in making the explosive material for the bomb. It is not enough to use ordinary uranium, but to build large atomic factories to get a high content of the rare isotope uranium-235. This is about 60% of the total effort and money spent on the project, but it only makes one bomb material. Then it's easy to make a uranium bomb. It's a little harder than you think, because it must be almost certain that it will work, so it needs a lot of research on what exactly will produce an atomic explosion, and the exact reason why this design works exactly as they expect. But it's not very complicated, and most of the work during the war is not that. Because of the uncertain smelting of uranium-235, it is also necessary to make a different explosive material, plutonium-239, which is an artificial element, and must be made in a large number of atomic machines. This is about 40% of the effort, but only for this plutonium-239 material. But in the process, it was discovered that plutonium-239 can't be used as a gun-type explosive like uranium-235, but it starts reacting too early and doesn't work. So most of the time was spent on a much more complicated design that can be used with plutonium-239, a fusion bomb. First of all, the first bombs are fission, not fusion. And it's not a violent collision that makes the reaction work, but the reaction is because these special reagents (called fissile materials) are in the right state, and a chain reaction occurs. The design must avoid the reaction of these materials until the time of the bomb explosion, and this is a very fast transition from "not going to react" to "going to react". Therefore, the gun-type explosive is to take two non-reactive substances of uranium-235, and quickly hit them together. Then the fusion bomb is to take a non-reactive substance of plutonium-239, and use a high explosive to increase the density to make it a reactive substance (three important (but not only) things in the state of the fissile material are whether it will react or not, and the important thing is whether it is going to react or not). ). Compared with that, about 4% of the total work on the atom bomb design. But why do you say that the main story is a bomb design and not a factory making explosives? It is mostly because it is more fun to tell a story about a smart man than to tell a story about a large factory.
A leaf-blower puts air in the sail, but the blower is also pushed back by a counter-force. So, as long as the blower is connected to the boat, the two forces cancel each other out, and you can't move. Of course, this means that if the blower isn't connected to the boat (for example, it's being held by someone on the shore), it'll work. But a hot air balloon doesn't blow air to create a force. It heats the air with a flame. Then the hot air spreads out, becomes less dense, and produces buoyancy in the balloon.
The two biggest factors are wind chill and relative humidity. The more wind there is, the colder the air feels, because the wind is blowing away the air that is warmed up by your body and instead bringing in fresh, cold air. A small wind can be refreshing, a strong wind much colder than you might expect. Higher humidity makes it feel warmer because it makes you sweat less. Extreme humidity will feel muggy and heavy.
Yes. Take the United States’ missile defence system. In the first line of defence you have Aegis missile cruisers. If they are strategically and fortunately placed, they can take a shot at a launching ballistic missile. The next line of defence is the Ground-based Midcourse Defence System (or GMD). This is a large missile system that launches an interceptor missile to try and intercept an incoming reentry vehicle in its suborbital phase. Next you have the Terminal High Altitude Air Defence system (or THAAD). It can hit the reentry vehicle in its terminal phase. Then there are systems like the Patriot missile. It can try and hit a separate reentry vehicle, but this is a random affair.
Your faucet has an aerator that mixes air bubbles with the water stream. The aerator can only work properly when the water stream is high enough to saturate it, adding bubbles that scatter light and make the water white. The bubbly water is less likely to splash than the untreated water, and the increased turbulence makes the water flow feel greater.
The ideal gas law: P V = nRT The ideal gas law is a theoretical formula; it can be altered in practice by certain factors, but for the sake of the ELI5 method, it means that the product of the pressure (P) and volume (V) is always equal to the product of the amount of gas (n), the temperature (T), and a fixed constant (R). This equation always holds. From this it can be seen that if we want to increase the pressure, there are three things we can do: increase the amount of gas (increase n), increase the temperature (increase T), or decrease the volume (decrease V). Any one of these three changes will balance the equation so that it still holds with the increased pressure. If we want to increase the pressure and maintain the volume and the amount of gas, we must increase the temperature.
The dimension of a space is nothing more than the minimum number of coordinates which is required to define a point exactly in that space. Take a line, for instance. A line is one-dimensional because it takes only one coordinate to specify a point in it. A plane square, such as a piece of paper, is two-dimensional because it takes two coordinates to specify a point on it: namely, the left-right and the up-down. A cube is three-dimensional because it takes three coordinates: the up-down, the left-right, and the back-front. But time also is a dimension, because time is inextricably linked with space, and to know where something is in space one also has to know at what point in time it is located. We know that there are at least three dimensions in space because we need three coordinates to specify the location of anything in space: the left-right, the up-down, and the back-front. There cannot be fewer than two dimensions, because we can see that things have a length, breadth, and height. There could be more, and some theories posit that there are many more hidden dimensions of space than the three that we see, but there is no proof that they exist, and there is certainly no proof that there are infinite dimensions, even though one can mathematically model them. As for why color or temperature are not dimensions, it is because they are just attributes of things, they do not tell you the location of anything in space.
If you're talking about sport climbing, someone goes on top of the cliff and finds a line that can be climbed. They put a few permanent slings into the rock as a kind of checkpoint, where the rope is tied and where they are caught in case of a fall.
Metals have free circulating electrons in their surface layers, so they conduct electricity easily, and a small difference in potential, or in the field of an electric field, can start the movement of these free circulating electrons, and the movement of these free circulating electrons is electricity. So the phenomenon of electricity caused by the occurrence of an electric field is called acousto-magnetic induction. This is the reason why radios work, why it is possible to put a circulating electric potential on an antenna and all metals within range will feel it (a corresponding circulating current will appear in them), and why transformers work. So your pulsar gives off a very strong radio frequency field. Since all the atoms in an electrical device are connected by wires, your pulsar will induce a strong and very chaotic current in all these wires, and this will burn out the atoms in all the components. You don't need a pulsar at all: electrical devices are ruined by the radiation from a microwave oven, by the radiation from a powerful transmitter antenna, by the radiation of the sun's flares, etc.
Fundamentally, a moving electric field—that is, a moving electric charge in a conductor—produces a magnetic field. And a magnetic field in turn generates an electric field. An electric charge always creates an electric field. Usually we describe how a single moving charge interacts with the stationary charges in our reference frame. That’s why we can speak of the magnetic field of a moving charge. But you could pick any frame of reference you like, and the effect would still be the same, so the important thing is the motion of the two charges relative to each other.
Water wants to stick to everything (that’s why it runs down your arm in the shower). The shape of a pourer is designed so that water can’t stick to it. Without a pourer, you have to hold the cup almost upside down, so that it doesn’t stick to the glass as it does in the shower.
magnetic bearings are very low-friction, but not no-friction. The moving magnetic field causes eddy currents in surrounding parts. And if one uses electric magnets as in maglev, then one has to superconduct in order to avoid heat losses.
You can't measure the interval between the gravity waves. Gravity doesn't travel as waves, gravity just is. When two heavy objects are in motion, they can increase the gravity along a line through the center of mass of both objects, and since they are rotating, they produce a gravitational wave that spirals outward at the speed of light. The closer they are and the faster they go, the more frequently we can measure these gravitational waves, until they approach each other, converge, and become one body.
General relativity is an application of geometry, the study of forms and surfaces. The four-dimensional surface used in general relativity is called spacetime, and it is the curvature of this surface that allows us to make practical predictions about gravity. But just as your textbook on magnetism doesn't say that a magnet shoots out arrows, so general relativity doesn't say that we actually live on a surface called spacetime and that it curves under the action of mass or energy. So no, matter does not displace spacetime because spacetime doesn't exist.
Mechanical advantage. Energy may be constant, but force is not. A small force is applied to the lever, which is moved a long way, and, in return, the vehicle is moved a short way by an enormous force.
In general, a liquid’s power of dissolving a substance depends on how quickly and completely the molecules of the solvent can surround the particles of the substance. When water or other liquids become warmer, the molecules have more energy, so they can take hold of the particles faster and more completely. It is a question of the motion of the particles, rather than of the space between them, for the volume of a liquid does not much change with the change of temperature.
ISS does not stand still. Clocks in ISS would run slower because of time dilation. There is also a difference in speed because of the opposite direction of gravity, but this is countered by the speed.
There is a lack of traction on the road. The rain washes the oil on the road to the top. Then a car skids and crashes into a pole. Then, when it's windy, a branch or a tree fall on the line. Rain does not cause a power failure, damage to the grid does.
It’s nothing. Except for some gas, rocks, dust, and radiation. You know how the atmosphere gets rarer and rarer the higher you go? Well, there you can’t find many gas molecules, and there’s nothing to take their place. So what’s left is nothing.
Let’s work it out! The brightness of a star is proportional to 1/distance. The sun illuminates the earth with a power of 1 kilowatt per square meter. The healthy human pupil when fully dilated has a diameter of about a centimeter. Therefore, when looking at the sun through a dilated pupil, aside from the pain, one lets in about 270 watts. If the sun were 10 light-years away, it would be as bright as a faint star. So to calculate the power falling on the eye from a faint star, we must divide 270 watts / (the distance of the sun in parsecs / the distance to the sun)2 =.06 x 10-14 watts. We only need to multiply by the average energy of a visible light particle, which is about 10-19 joule. We thus get a rough figure of a hundred and sixty thousand photons per second. But this is a long way above the threshold of perception, which is reached at about a hundred photons. It is the ambient light in the atmosphere, and not the darkness that limits our vision, that limits our perception of a star. A closed room is darker than the night. [ed. sorry, I was using the raw sun-power in space, only 1 kilowatt per square meter makes it to the ground, so my figure is a bit on the high side. However, there are other errors involved.]
The universe is expanding and it seems to be accelerating. This is a phenomenon that cannot be explained, it is attributed to the unknown dark energy, or even perhaps to dark matter. The heat result is very interesting, it may be a manifestation of the dark energy, and in the future someone will be able to combine both accelerating expansion and rising temperature into a single theory. Then, that answer will be worth a Nobel prize.
Diamonds aren't *really* heat resistant, not more than a decent steel. They start turning into vapor at a temperature of about 1,000° C. When it comes to heat resistance, we normally rely on tungsten.
If your phone falls, the screen protector takes the damage. In other words, it's the same principle as wearing a helmet. Does he believe in helmets?
- Because the transition from liquid to vapor is not what burns. Hot water burns. The boiling water is hot. It burns. Reduce the degree of boiling by one, and it no longer burns as much. Water that turns into vapor is not hot. The energy necessary for a molecule to jump from water into the air is not enough to damage the body. When the water is so hot that the molecules are thrown off with such force that they displace all the air around them, then there is enough to do damage.
You're right. An electrically resistive space heater is 100 % efficient in converting electricity into heat. (Even the small part of the energy that turns into light reflects off the walls and back into the room as heat.) The small ones might have a hard time spreading the heat around, but if they put out the same amount of watts, they put out the same amount of heat.
it is not a gas like the one that burns on the hearth; it is a fusion, the conversion of hydrogen into helium, but this hydrogen is being consumed. The sun will therefore be exhausted in a few billion years. You underestimate the sun's colossal size and the quantity of hydrogen still in it.
Very large nuclei are highly unstable. They are created by smashing together small nuclei, and after a very short time they decay into even smaller nuclei.
It is because a bicycle is a dynamically stable machine. Any change in the angle of the front wheel makes the whole frame lean toward the angle and straightens up. Try it out. Stand next to a stationary bike and hold it by the seat. Then lean it and watch the handlebars. You will see the effect immediately. In motion the handlebars are twisted a little and that is enough to correct the small angle. It is like holding a stick upright on your finger. If the stick starts to fall you shift your finger “in front” of the fall to keep it up. The bicycle does something similar while it is moving. But when it stops, it falls down, just like a stick that you have stopped moving.
Humphry Davy, a famous British chemist and inventor, had experimented 200 years before Thomas Alva Edison with electricity and light. He discovered that if a wire carries a current, it heats up and gives off light. The trouble was, Davy could not find any substance that would give off light brightly, burn for a long time and not cost a fortune. In 1839, before Edison, a man named Warren De La Rue solved the scientific problem of how to make a light bulb burn brightly and last a long time. He used very thin high resistance wires, which he enclosed in a vacuum-packed glass envelope made of a metal with a high melting point. De La Rue used very expensive platinum wires, and he could not maintain a proper vacuum, which made the device too expensive for general use. His light bulbs quickly went out. Then, Edison used a thin carbon wire, and invented a better vacuum system, so people think he invented the lightbulb. But when Westinghouse got the contract to light the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago, they could not use the screw-in sockets Edison had invented, so a new socket was invented with a twist-on cap.
As you have pointed out, when there is no load connected it is very easy to turn the machine. Consequently you haven’t expended much energy in making it turn, so there isn’t much energy to go somewhere. And what little energy you do expend, goes to friction in the bearings, and maybe a little joule heat from eddy currents.
It's all a matter of resistance, and power is lost on the way. They can reduce this loss by using bigger wires and higher voltages, which lowers the current carrying the same power. But even so, about 5 percent of the electricity generated in the United States is lost in the transmission lines. That's why you need many power stations instead of feeding the world from a single solar farm in the desert.
It’s always looking back in time. Light travels 300 million meters per second. That’s a ridiculously fast speed. But it’s not instantaneous. If you stand a meter and a half away from a mirror and look at your reflection, the light has to travel three meters before it reaches your eye. It has to go from your body to the mirror, then back to your eye. It takes about 10 nanoseconds, or 10 millionths of a second, to reach you, which is 0.00000001 of a second. So you’re looking at yourself as you were 0.00000001 of a second ago. For practical purposes, however, you can think of it as instantaneous. Space is vast. It’s beyond comprehension. Even at light speed, it takes eight minutes for the sun’s light to reach us. When you look at the sun (please don’t do this), you’re seeing light that left eight minutes ago. If the sun suddenly disappeared, we wouldn’t notice for eight minutes. But that’s just our own star. Proxima Centauri, the nearest star, is so far away that it takes four years for its light to reach us. So when we point a telescope at it, or just our eyes, we’re seeing light that left the star four years ago. We’re literally looking at the universe in the past. Because the universe is so huge, they had to come up with a new measure of distance, the light-year. This is the distance light can travel in a year, which is about 10 trillion meters. The Andromeda galaxy is our nearest neighboring galaxy. It’s about 2 million light-years away. This means that when we point a telescope at it, we see light that left the galaxy 2 million years ago, and that’s been traveling at 300 million meters per second for all that time. This is what it means when we say a telescope can see back in time. The light has traveled so far that it’s taken that long to reach us!
It is a process which takes place without the object undergoing any change in temperature, and is accompanied by a change in pressure and volume. The Boyle law is:
How do you suppose the pieces are coming towards you? You see them flying in all directions, do you not?
Just like a waterfall is just a river with a sharp drop in it, it does not run out of water because there is enough water upstream (typically the melt from snow) to keep it supplied. But like any river, under the right circumstances, it can run dry.
In either case the result would be the same. Except the cool air would “penetrate” your home through every crack. And if you have a good climate control system, it would have both of them (connected, in a heat exchanger, to a radiator for heat recovery in winter).
It is not true that mirrors ever flip reflections. Or rather one could say that they flip front-back since your image is facing you, but not left-right. We expect them to flip left-right since a person facing us has to turn to the right. That is why they are confusing.
[Footnote 1: A certain downward motion does not affect your weight. For example, when I go down in the elevator, after the initial acceleration, I don't feel any different. Your weight is not affected by your speed (in whatever direction you are moving), but only by your speed, that is, your speed, and your weight (and a few other things, like your position in the gravitational field, and the buoyancy of the liquid you are in, but I don't think that's what you are asking).
It's probably magic. Like the other three forces of nature, gravity, strong and weak. But we don't really know why it works. It just works. Anyone who develops a theory would probably get the physics nobel prize and a ridiculous amount of money.
Gravity also pulls down other objects, such as air, which is heavier than the cloud. The cloud is heavy, but the air beneath it, which it would displace if it were to fall, is even heavier. But the feather is small, and the air it would displace is small, and so the weight of the feather overcomes the weight of the air it would displace.
Very simple. The mass-less photon is an extraordinary entity; it has no rest mass and only exists at high velocity; it is a particle with angular momentum, although it has neither mass nor width; it is the antiparticle of itself, for antimatter processes produce photons identical with those produced by the regular matter processes.
You're talking about the shockwaves from explosions? The shockwave is essentially a whole lot of air molecules knocking each other over and carrying the kinetic energy to the next air molecules. The pusher of the first domino is the explosion.
True vacuum is an arbitrary term since matter and energy are interchangeable in E=mc2. You can’t create space that has no energy. Space itself is charged with energy in the realm of quantum mechanics.
We both measure the same speed; the difference between us appears in the frequency, which, as we approach the source, moves up to higher values (the blue shift) and as we move away from the source, it moves down (the red shift). There is no such thing as a stationary observer, but you must mean one who is stationary with respect to the source. This is why we both measure the same speed, because the speed of time varies with our relative motion. We have a light source at A, a stationary observer at B with respect to A, and ourselves moving towards A (with respect to both A and B). Because we are moving relative to B, the speed of time elapses for us more slowly than for B. When all the dust has settled, we both measure exactly the same speed.
V = IR Where: V=volts, R=resistance, I=amps, R=resistance x current.
The first known calculation was made by Eratosthenes in about 240 BC. The dates of solstices and midsummer had been known for a thousand years or more. Eratosthenes went and found out where the sun's rays illumined the bottom of a well on midsummer's day at a place on the equator. He then verified the length of a shadow cast by a vertical pole on that day, some three hundred miles away. These two observations, combined with his knowledge of the distances between the two points, and the fact that the rays from the sun were vertical in one and inclined in the other, enabled him to calculate the diameter of the earth. This calculation was within the errors of measurement.
Nuclear research, as you might expect from the name. They are most famous for creating the World-Wide-Web (not the Internet), and for having built the Large Hadron Collider, which confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson, nicknamed the god particle. Well, yes. They do a lot of research. This ranges from the enormous speed and energy at which they smash particles together, to how to improve the World-Wide-Web.
The wind is neither hot nor cold. But it can reduce the pressure. When that happens, the humidity on the skin evaporates quicker. That’s because in lower pressure, the fast-moving molecules evaporate first and leave the slower ones behind. So the average temperature of the humidity is lowered and so is the temperature of the skin. Even in the absence of wind, this evaporation takes place. But with wind, it happens at a distinctly lower temperature. And that’s why wind seems cold.
Our eyes perceive flickering light as a constant light if it is below the flicker fusion threshold. A camera doesn't have this problem because a typical camera shutter speed is 1/60th of a second, which is more than enough to distinguish individual pulses.
It is a chemical property, namely the temperature at which a substance reacts with air. All chemistry is a special case of physics, and the chemical reactions are accomplished by the physical properties of the electrons.
It travels at its own velocity with respect to you. Consequently, its velocity with respect to the earth is the same, plus the speed of the train, since it was already moving at the speed of the train inside your gun.
Depending on the definition of fan, a turbopump could lower the pressure in an enclosed space to about 10 – 13 of an atmosphere.
Certain pairs of properties of a particle or system cannot be known with arbitrary accuracy simultaneously. This is not a technological problem—we don't need new technology to resolve it—nor is it even a physics problem—we need better representations of nature. This is more fundamental. The simplest example is the position and the speed of a particle. Speed is defined as the rate at which position changes. So if you want to know the speed of a particle with arbitrary accuracy, you have to know its position with arbitrary accuracy for a short time. So when we want to know the speed, we have to make the position approximate because it changes with time. On the other hand, if we want to know the position exactly, we have to know exactly at what time. Essentially, we cannot determine the speed. Speed is spread over space and time, position is a point. We can't have both. But we can choose the uncertainty of one, we can have both. For example, the particle will be at that point and at that speed during the time it is there. The other example is the position and the frequency of the wave. The wave is by definition extended in space. A single-frequency wave has infinite extension and no position. But if you add several frequencies, they will interfere to produce a more limited space-time. But the more accurate the position, the more waves you have to add. So we can't know them with arbitrary accuracy. Whenever this kind of interaction occurs, it is the Heisenberg principle.
Light can be polarized as well as being ultra-violet. They are not two separate things, but two different labels which designate different properties of the same light. Light is composed of a wavy electric and magnetic field, just like the waves in a puddle when a stone is dropped in it, or a wavy string, with a strong field where the string is high, and a reverse field where the string is low. This field vibrates up and down as light travels. The faster the vibration, the higher the frequency, and this frequency determines the color of light. Red light, for instance, has a lower frequency than blue light, and radio waves, which are light as well, have a lower frequency still. Hence, we have certain light-waves that we cannot see. Violet is the highest-colored light that we can see, and ultra-violet has a higher frequency, so we can't see it. So ultra-violet light means light with a certain frequency, or speed of vibration. Since light also has a direction of vibration, we can also speak of the direction of its vibration: up and down, or sideways, or intermediate between the two. This direction of its vibration is called its polarization. Most light, such as sunlight, is composed of waves with all directions, so it is not polarized. On the other hand, when the light all has the same direction of vibration, we call it polarized light.
If you are referring to a filter that has a narrow band, you would see no patch of light on the blue wall. If you are referring to a strip of wall, a patch of blue will appear.
The sound we hear is the result of vibrations in the air. But the vibrations can also travel through a solid object such as a wall, and they can still vibrate the air enough for us to hear them. When you hear someone talking in a room across the way, you can hear that the voice has changed because the vibrations are moving through the wall differently.
They don’t. They don’t even know if it’s finite or infinite. All they know is that it’s much bigger than the observable universe, because they can see stars that are beyond the observable universe, and can calculate their distance from us as about four times the radius of the observable universe (I don’t have the figures to hand, but I think it’s something like that).
: A conscious observer is essentially unimportant. The word measurement is often misleading in quantum mechanics; a better word would be interaction. You can only measure something if you let it interact. In the double-slit experiment, for example, you can't have a photon go through the two slits and be detected without the photon affecting the detector in some way and thus decohering the wave.
It depends on how many ‘free’ or ‘electronic’ atoms are in the material. When visible light hits the material, the free-moving atoms can absorb the energy and re-emit it in a different direction. Metals are shiny and opaque because they have free-moving atoms which can respond to light. But glass has no free-moving atoms, so the light doesn’t have enough energy to do anything with it and just passes through.
We don't know. All we know is that all matter and all energy, even time and space itself, came into being at the moment of the big bang. The how and the why are still a mystery to science.
We predicted them long before there was any evidence they existed, or could even exist. Theoretically, in Einstein's general theory of relativity, it was found that if something is dense enough, it will collapse indefinitely and reach a point from which not even light can escape. Subsequently, a number of radio sources were discovered whose properties were very similar to those of a black hole.
It is said that the relationship between the wavelength and the frequency of all waves is determined by the speed. Two waves of the same length can travel at different speeds, the one that travels faster is the one with the higher frequency. Speed is the distance per unit time, frequency is the number of turns per unit time, and wavelength is the length. Wavelength * frequency = speed. The speed of the wave is constant for the radiation, the speed of light. Therefore, the frequency is determined by the wavelength. The longer the wavelength, the lower the frequency. Red light, 700nm wavelength, 4.29*1014.hz frequency. You know? That's how it is.
Before that time, there were very vague ideas in physics about the relationship between matter and energy. They were considered two different things. This equation demonstrated that everything is energy. Then it established the relation between them in a way that explained fusion, fission, and radioactivity. In practical terms, it explained radioactivity, as well as why the orbit of Mercury was not predictable by Newtonian physics. Consequently, it also explained why we understand the universe in a different way.
They fly through the air; if the air is moving, then they have to adjust themselves to the medium through which they are flying. The same is true for airplanes and boats in the water. It's the first problem in trigonometry to calculate the direction and speed to go to offset the speed and direction of the wind. Most of the time, the birds have enough power to counteract the wind and go in the direction they want. If the wind is too strong and they can't fly fast enough to counter it, they can't fly in such conditions.
We usually measure relative rather than absolute amounts, taking it for granted that there is no daughter in the original formation of the rock. For example, if we are measuring lead-uranium dating, we can choose a mineral that will reject lead during the formation of the crystal, so there will be no lead in the crystal during its formation. There might be some uranium, however. Later, the uranium can decay to lead and remain in the crystal, which we can then measure. Having knowledge that the lead that we see was originally uranium, we can calculate how long it took the uranium to decay to lead in the amount we see.
During the course of the storm, ice crystals and other particles inside the clouds collide with each other. Some particles acquire a positive charge and some particles a negative charge. Since the positive particles are carried upward, the negative particles gather in the lower part of the cloud, which is the side that touches the ground. The negatively charged bottom of the cloud repels the negative charges of the earth. The earth below the storm thus loses its negative charge and acquires a positive charge. Thus the bottom of the cloud becomes negatively charged and the ground beneath becomes positively charged. In order to restore the balance, lightning jumps from one to the other.
Not at all. It is more powerful in a small area but doesn't have enough strength to affect the Earth. It's just like a small flame, which is much hotter than an ocean, but doesn't heat the ocean. The scientific explanation is as follows: The magnetic field is a local value. It tells us how much force is there, but it doesn't tell us how much energy is there. The Earth's magnetic field is weak locally but very large.
You mean analogy (this is not restricted to physics), it is the notion that, lacking data in reality, we can argue that X is true by proving that: a) X resembles Y in important ways, b) Y is true, based on data we do have, c) the ways X is not like Y are not relevant to b) , d) therefore X is true. For example, you could say you haven't observed whether your apartment building would fall if a kitchen were to catch fire. But you have examples of other apartment buildings of similar size, similar building material and construction, built to similar standards, which have had kitchen fires and not fallen. So you can deduce with good probability that your apartment building would not fall from a kitchen fire. The difficult part is proving c) above. A dog and a cat resemble each other in many ways, and in many situations the differences between them are not relevant, they both need oxygen, both need milk for their young, etc., but in some situations the differences will be extremely important, like the chances of survival when thrown out of a window (in a kitchen fire, perhaps), so you really have to explain why the differences aren't relevant.
The one-way speed of light?
The tuna itself does not. Depending on the process, water ice may form on the tuna, increasing its weight.
They use a magnetic field to set the iron particles in the pan vibrating, which heats them up. The stovetop itself gets hot only when the pan is on it, and cools quickly when you lift it off.
Energy comes in a great many different forms, such as mechanical energy, heat, and light. And the way it interacts with matter depends on the type of energy and the type of matter, because the different kinds of matter respond differently to the different kinds of energy.
It's possible that the Universe is infinite, but there is still some doubt because of observation. We only see the part of the universe that is visible to us, but we are sure that the Universe is greater. The universe is expanding because the space between every object in the universe is increasing. The space between an atom's nucleus and its electrons theoretically increases, but the electrostatic attraction keeps the atom in its place. The result is that the space between the stars and the planets gets bigger.
The L2 point is a semi-stable point in the Sun-Earth system where the combined gravitational pulls of the two bodies will hold an object in place. It’s semi-stable in that it is stable in some directions but not in others. You can be a little off-point and orbit naturally, but only in some directions. Imagine a marble on a saddle. If the marble rolls forward or backward, the saddle will roll it back the way it came. The James Webb orbit is like a marble rolling back and forth on the saddle. But if the marble were to roll off the saddle to the left or right, the saddle would roll it off in that direction. So James Webb has to carefully keep its distance from the Sun or it will be dragged away from L2. That’s why it has maneuvering thrusters that must be fired from time to time, and they will eventually run out of fuel. The L4 and L5 points are in fact stable. Objects can be placed there and kept in place with little or no fuel. But they are much farther from the Sun than L2.
Salt water is denser than fresh water. Since floating is proportional to the weight of the body that displaces the liquid, in a denser fluid you displace less water for a given weight, and therefore float higher and easier.
Other people are unable to answer. What we have here is a machine that converts the air that the musician breathes out of his mouth into a vibrating air that we sense as sound. And really, sound does not take much energy. A wind instrument will, for instance, release only a millionth of a watt in the form of sound, which is very little compared to the kinetic energy of the air that is blown out of the mouth. So by converting only a little of the air’s energy into sound, you can make a great sound.
It’s because AC takes moisture out of the air and makes it colder. That’s why it feels different than the dry air outside. When there’s a lot of water vapor in the air, it feels different on our skin. Water likes to stick to things.
But we are here speaking of the light as a wave. If light is a wave, then its field is disturbed by the jostling of the charge particles. Light, being an oscillation of the electromagnetic field, also entrains the charged particles in the surrounding medium and thus undergoes retardation. Similarly, photons are also disturbed by the medium, when they meet more particles (say, more charged particles like the electrons) and the particles, in turn, are disturbed by the light wave, which also sets up a disturbance which, in turn, may set up a disturbance which in turn may set up a disturbance which disturbs the original wave and retards it (or may even cause it to speed up in some circumstances). The photons enter the optically denser medium and exit at the opposite side. In between, according to the rules of quantum mechanics, the light traverses through all the possible paths between the two points. Each path may have its own phase. The total time required for the photon to traverse the medium is the average of the time taken by the light on all the paths, with their own phases. It will be slightly longer than the actual time taken by the light to traverse the medium.
Basically, it's a complicated explanation that can't be summed up in a simple sentence: the universe does not expand at the speed of light, it moves faster, and the farther it moves, the further things move away from us. So, while no galaxy is older than the universe, it is more distant in light years than the universe is old.
An explosion is a sudden release of energy, and the release of energy is called a shock wave. This shock wave compresses the air in front of it, which then expands in front of the shock wave. If this compressed air hits the human body, it can cause serious damage to our soft insides, even if we don't have any shrapnel.
It is very important if the students can see the hall in front of them. This is called supersonic or subsonic. When you can see (subsonic) you react to what's ahead of you. If the hall is narrowing you speed up because the hall is getting smaller and if you slow down you get run over by the ones behind you. If the hall is widening, you slow down because there is more space. But when you don't know what's ahead of you, you can't do anything about it, that's supersonic. The “ahead” can’t influence your movements because you can’t see it. The rule is that the converging always drives you to Mach 1 (the speed of sound, the sonic flow). But the flow can't be converging indefinitely. It will “squeeze” at a certain point and there can be no more gas with the temperature and pressure that the incoming gas has. So, at the narrowest point you are subsonic or sonic, and if you want to accelerate supersonic past that, you must diverge. Above all, you don't add or subtract heat from the flow. If you do that (with a hot tube, with combustion in the tube, etc.), it gets even weirder.
As it takes time for water to come out of a hose and hit the ground. The light from the Sun is always streaming down, but if you were to follow one ray of light, it would take 8 minutes to travel from the sun to the earth.
- let's imagine a carousel. If we look at it when it's turning, you see a very different effect than when it's standing still. It's clearly pushing people against the walls, that's the centrifugal force. It manifests itself because their inertia wants to keep them moving in a straight line, but the wall catches them and pushes them inward. It's a fictitious force when you look at a non-rotating reference frame, but in a rotating reference frame it's quite real. The centripetal force is an inwardly directed force. It's actually the normal force of the wall, but for a rotating reference frame, looking and talking about centripetal and centrifugal forces is more intuitive. The Coriolis effect comes from the movement of something in a rotating frame, observed by a rotating observer. If someone on the wall takes a ball and throws it straight into the center, the ball seems to curve from the perspective of that person, because the person is still spinning. In reality, the ball has left the rotating frame and has entered a non-rotating frame, and from the perspective of the ball, it goes straight to the center of the carousel, it is the people on the wall that move.
"Just gone" and "smashed into a fine paste of indistinguishable biological matter" are pretty much the same thing. A building fell on people. If a slab of concrete falls on a body, there might not be much left to find.
The Big Bang did not happen in one place, as if everything had then expanded from that point. It happened everywhere. If you go one billion light years to the left, that’s where the Big Bang took place. And if you go one billion light years to the right, the same thing happened there. And if you look at the place where you are, the same thing happened there. It’s difficult to explain, but we have the best idea that space itself is infinite. So if you were to travel fourteen billion years to the furthest galaxy you can see and, when you got there, you looked back the way you came, you would still see galaxies fourteen billion light years away. And if you went in that direction, you would see even more. Imagine the infinite number line from minus infinity to plus infinity. So where’s the center? Zero, you might say. But the center could be any number on that line. If you pick a number—say, one hundred—you find infinitely many numbers smaller than one hundred and infinitely many bigger than one hundred. If you pick a negative number, there are infinitely many smaller than one billion and infinitely many larger than one billion. So from any point in the universe we can look in any direction and see the echo of the Big Bang—the cosmic microwave background. We can then calculate the rate of energy loss of the CMB and, with some good theoretical knowledge of the temperature at which atoms form, calculate the time needed for the CMB to cool from the temperature at which atoms formed to its current temperature. And we do all this without having to see beyond the part of the universe that we can see.
both the boiling point and the freezing point of water are dependent on the pressure. For example, increasing the pressure may raise the boiling point of water, and consequently raise its boiling point above 100° C. The same phenomenon also occurs during freezing, and is called undercooling. To freeze, there must be a nucleus, that is, small defects, edges, or sharp edges on which the first ice crystals can be formed. If you have pure water in a perfectly smooth container, the water will not freeze, because there is no nucleus. You can then make this water almost instantly freeze by giving it a nucleus, e.g. pouring it. Since the water is colder than its freezing point, as soon as it gets a nucleus, it will freeze almost immediately.
A food gets hot by absorbing heat. The more food that is put into the oven, the more heat it will need. There can only be so much heat produced at certain temperatures because the materials are all different in energy content.
It’s a substance, and since all substances are subject to gravity, it will be drawn toward the nearest celestial body—the Earth, the moon, Mars, and so on.
Weight is a measure of the amount of gravitational force a body experiences.
Yes, but only a little. Fans push air from the bathroom outside. Since unless you’re in a bomb shelter your house isn’t completely airtight, air will get in wherever it can, whether through poorly sealed windows or a single pinhole somewhere in the house.
They are covered with an anti-reflective coating, which increases their efficiency and light-absorbing power. The way they are manufactured, by melting small silicon crystals together, makes them less efficient than black panels, but also much less expensive. They are called polycrystalline because they are made of a large number of small silicon crystals fused together. The black panels are monocrystalline —they are just one large, perfectly aligned crystal—which is more efficient and does not require the anti-reflective coating. The blue panels have an efficiency of 13 to 17%, the black ones of 20 to 22%.
A gas is compressed inside the box by a special machine, the 'compressor'. This makes the gas get hotter, but as long as the gas contains the same amount of heat, it will continue to heat up. So heat too will be compressed. The tubes run along a long way behind the back of the box, so that air from outside circulates over them. This air cools the tubes, and they reach a temperature equal to that of the room. The gas is now uncompressed, that is, it is expanded. But since the hot part of the tubes has taken heat away from the gas, the gas is now at a lower temperature than the room temperature. The cold gas then runs along the tubes to the other end of the box. There the heat of the inside of the box makes the gas warm again, but the inside of the box is getting cooler. The warm gas goes back to the compressor, and in this way it goes on and on.
The flame heats the water and ammonia, and the resulting vapour passes into a condenser, where it condenses into a liquid and goes into another condenser containing hydrogen. The hydrogen mixes with the ammonia, and this reaction absorbs heat from the inside of the cabinet. After the reaction, the hydrogen is separated out, and the ammonia returns to a vapour, which mixes with the water again, and the process is repeated.
Light is composed of photons, which are of the nature of an electro-magnetic wave. When an electric field changes a little, a magnetic field is created, and when a magnetic field changes a little, an electric field is created. So when a magnetic field changes, an electric field is created outside of the region. And when an electric field changes, a magnetic field is created outside of the region. The photon, therefore, cannot do anything but move away from the position of its creation. For example, when an electron falls from a high-energy orbit around an atom or a molecule to a low-energy orbit, light can be likened to a rock thrown into a pond. In the center, the water recedes, pushing the water around it upward, and pushing the water around that upward. Thus, the ripples move away. Q: Why is it that the electric and magnetic fields are so connected? A: That is one of the great unsolved problems of physics. There are many theories and many models in the physics field. None of these theories is proven, but we try to eliminate the bad ones.
You just said it yourself: the universe is expanding, but the amount of energy is the same; so it cools as it expands.
There are two ways. The first is via satellite. The global positioning system satellites have atomic clocks in them. They are also almost in line of sight at the speed of light. And with only small differences in the speed of light over relatively short distances, it is very easy to calculate the exact difference in time using high-precision timers and special receivers. So, by using the global positioning system to distribute time from the American atomic clock, the error between the different atomic clocks can be kept down to ten billionths of a second. The other way is by direct light signal. The speed of light is the same for all, so the length of the cable can be accurately calculated. The delay can be measured by the atomic clock directly, and the difference can be controlled within a few billionths of a second.
I can't do it, but basically you reverse the way you walk normally. The trick is to put all your weight on your front foot and glide the other foot along the ground lightly. Now, it takes a lot of practice, but eventually it becomes perfectly natural.
We're talking about 14 billion years in our (earth's) frame. As long as we specify where we are, there is no problem of relative time.
The object exists and is responsible for this effect. Why would there be a constant transfer of energy? Since no work is being done, there is no reason why energy should be expended.
The strings are only slightly affected by gravity, and therefore the absence of gravity would not produce any measurable difference. If you are in a station with an atmosphere, it will sound almost the same as on earth, although you would have to rely on the acoustics of the apparatus around you. If you are not firmly connected, you will be constantly rotating in the opposite direction to the motion of your arms, but the whole rotation will be negligible. A possible effect, after a while, is that the strings, because they are vibrating, would push the air away in a particular direction. Then after a while, you would start to turn in the opposite direction to this direction. Outside, without an atmosphere, the strings would have nothing to transfer their vibration to and would not produce a sound. But they would vibrate for a long time because they would not lose energy in producing sound. But this energy would finally be converted into heat by the resistance of the violin and your hands and then dissipate.
A matter of wavelength. An efficient antenna must be on the order of the wavelength it is to pick up, which is possible with radio waves but would have to be microscopic with visible light (about half a micron). Another way of putting it is that in its properties of wave and particle, at long wavelengths (low energies), it behaves more like a wave, and more like a particle (photon) at shorter wavelengths (greater energies). Light lies somewhere in between and can behave as both: like a wave in interference experiments (you can find many examples of the double-slit experiment on the Internet), and like a particle in special devices that can pick up individual photons.
Light, as it strikes something, is absorbed a little; and, depending on the nature of the object, a different proportion of different rays is reflected or absorbed, depending on the nature of the object. But, in the end, all the light will be absorbed by something in the room, and this is very quick because of the speed of light.
There is a concept called “entropy,” which is a peculiar way of expressing “chaos.” It goes like this: suppose you have a glass of water coloured red and another of blue; you cannot put them together in the same glass and expect the dyes to mix. The red water is full of red particles, the blue water of blue particles. If you put the two glasses together it is as if the universe collapsed. The blue particles want to move where the red particles are, the red particles want to move where the blue particles are. Eventually they are equally distributed and you have purple water. So in essence, unless you work against it, the system tends to go from order to disorder. That’s entropy. This is exactly what happens with heat. Suppose you put a flame under one side of a spoon, it will eventually heat up all over. You cannot keep one side hot and the other cold for long. The red and blue water analogy holds here too. Everything is made of particles. When something is warm, its particles are vibrating, they move faster. When it’s cold they move more slowly. So if you heat one side of the spoon, those fast particles are constantly knocking against the slow ones, which then in turn make the slow ones go faster. At the same time the fast particles lose some of their energy and slow down, which is why the spoon will eventually heat up evenly. That’s entropy in action. The universe abhors that sort of arrangement, where there is a lot of heat in one place (the sun, the earth) and almost none in another (space). It wants everything to be chaotic, in other words evenly distributed. So the heat death of the universe is like the spoon analogy on a gigantic scale. The earth is the spoon, and we are losing heat to the universe. The sun is sending its particles at us, and we are getting warmer. That’s not a good arrangement, the universe doesn’t like it. One day the sun will have used up all its fuel and there will be nothing left to make its reactions go. Then it will stop giving off heat. The earth will then cool down, and will eventually reach the same temperature as space around it. And that is how it will go on for ever. The heat will eventually stop coming in from the sun. In a few million years’ time everything will have reached the same temperature. That’s the heat death. It is not a nice place to be for us.
We can’t. We can only estimate the minimum size, and it could be infinite. We know how big the observable universe is, and that’s determined by how old the universe is and how it expands, and that yields a radius of 46.5 billion light-years. This is the part of the universe that we can observe from earth. The radius is the current radius. What is now 46.5 billion light-years away was a lot closer when it emitted the light that is now reaching us. The light from it has only been traveling as long as the universe has existed. So, for example, if an object is 46.5 billion light-years away, then the light from it has traveled only 13.7 billion light-years. From the measurement of the universe’s flatness, it can be deduced that the universe is at least 250 times bigger than the observable universe. That means that it may be finite, but it may also be infinite. That is an open question. We may never know the answer. So we don’t know the size of the universe, it’s an open question where we have not reached a conclusion. You can read more about this on the wikipedia page about the universe.
The wind blows outside the open window and causes a local vacuum based on the Venturi principle. This vacuum, in turn, causes air inside the room to rush in so as to equalize the pressures. The air inside the room rushes towards the window, which in turn causes the door to open.
B: C: D: The water in all three boxes is at the same level, and the pipe connecting them is at the same level? Q: The water in box 1 and box 3 is higher than the water in box 2.
Gas or diesel engines require the engine to spin in order to give any power to the wheels. If you want more power, you can only increase the amount of fuel to a certain point. Getting more power from an engine means making it spin faster at some point. But the faster it spins, the more energy it consumes in just spinning itself, and there is a limit to how fast you can make all the countless moving parts spin. In order to get the most power out of an engine, it should spin as slowly as possible. So the question is, how can you get the engine to turn fast or slow depending on how fast the wheels turn? The answer is a gearbox, which allows you to change the ratio between the engine speed and wheel speed. If you want lots of power but want to go slowly, then low gears are used, which means that the engine is turned a lot of times for each wheel spin. If you want to go fast but still use the least possible fuel, then high gears are used. Electric motors do not have this problem. To get more power out of an electric motor, you just feed it more electricity. If you want even more power, then you feed it even more electricity. The speed at which the motor turns is a minor consideration in how much power it can give, so there is much less need to use a gearbox to choose the speed of the motor for a certain speed of the car.
Your body temperature is approximately 37° C. But your body is always releasing heat. The heat must go somewhere, and it flows from hot to cold. Air is a poor conductor of heat. A temperature difference between hot and cold in the air helps to overcome the poor heat conductivity (which is not the right word, but it is used here to express this concept). Water is a good heat conductor. Therefore, if the water is cold, it will take heat from your body too quickly, and your body must work harder to regain the lost heat. If the water is warmer, the lower temperature difference helps to overcome the high heat conductivity. In hot air, the poor heat conductivity makes your body heat up, which can only be solved by perspiring, which is unpleasant for you, or by raising your body temperature, which is unpleasant and dangerous. Therefore, it is good to be in cool air or warm water, because they are closest to the heat produced by your body.
well, we live on continents, not on peninsulas. And yes, we see different stars when we are south of the equator than when we are north of it. You can’t see the Southern Cross from Maine, and you can’t see the Big Dipper from South Africa, for example. Stars that are more in line with our equator are visible in both hemispheres.
Please be more precise. I’m not sure what you’re talking about.
But we do have a much more reliable source of energy. Lightning is unpredictable and does not occur often enough to meet the modern demand for energy. We can generate far more electricity with the power stations we already have and we can do it reliably enough that we can build a system on it and not have to wait for good weather.
The trampoline example is useful for showing how the orbits move, but it can be overanalyzed (“What is it that’s pulling the ball down?”). I prefer the one where you and I are standing a meter apart at the equator, with a compass in our hand and heading north. Now, if the earth was flat, longitudes would be parallel, and every time I looked over at you you would be a meter away. But because the earth is curved, the longitudes are directed toward the poles, so that, little by little, while we are both heading north, we are getting closer and closer. If we did not know that the earth was curved, we would think that there is some sort of force that is pulling us together. That is how spacetime is. Everything (even light itself) is following its own “straight line” (geodesic), but the curve of these lines is what creates gravity, makes light rays curve, and so on.
The atmosphere is not under uniform pressure everywhere. There are zones of high pressure and zones of low pressure. Wind is simply the air flowing from zones of high pressure to zones of low pressure. The difference in pressure is generally caused by the difference in temperature. You can learn more here:
. No, the jumping and landing involves much greater acceleration than standing. You go from a speed to a stop in a very short distance (depending on the density of your shoe). So a good bit of acceleration is needed besides the regular 9.8 m/s2 needed to keep you at the same distance from the center of the earth.
The question is based on a common misunderstanding. The Big Bang did not happen in a particular place, it happened everywhere. The only difference is that the places were much closer together in the early universe, so that all places were almost exactly the same distance from each other. As the universe grew, distances quickly grew. Things did not move through space, but space itself was getting farther away from other places. Even when it was very close and dense, the universe was probably infinite.
Ionizing radiation can knock an electron off an atom. (The radiation gives the electron enough energy to tear itself away from its atom.) These electrons are the things that hold molecules together, so if you throw one away, the molecule suddenly has an end hanging off, and it will quickly try to find another to replace it. (It will react with whatever it can find.) Now, DNA is a very long and complex molecule. You can damage it, and it might actually disintegrate (in which case, the cell is basically dead), but you might also damage it without making it totally useless, and the genes it carries might change. That might make the cell go crazy, as cancerous cells do, when their controls and mechanisms for destroying themselves malfunction. But as you can see, this is pretty much just a matter of chance. So small doses of radiation are pretty safe (and that’s what we’re exposed to all the time). But the more radiation you get, the more likely it is that something will go wrong in a bad way.
Imagination alight. Imagine a ray of light emitted or reflected from a particular point on the object, and that, if the aperture is infinitely small, then the ray of light can end up only at one place after passing through it. Then imagine the rays from all parts of the object; the result is the perfect picture of the object. If the aperture is large, however, you can have two rays of light coming from a particular point on the object, at slightly different angles, but they still pass through the aperture, and when the single point is somehow represented in two places after passing through the aperture, then the result is blur.
After 500 million years of evolution of life on earth, we have adapted to a three dimensional existence. Some living beings are capable of making a plan for the future and thus enter into the dimension of time. A fourth spatial dimension has no significance in our life as yet. That is if it exists. Therefore not only man but no animal can visualize it. A four dimensional life is not in the genetic makeup of the earth.
[fa] It is the usual case that hydrogen is the proton and not deuterium (H-2) or tritium (H-3), then the collision of three is a combination of helium. The hydrogen reaction is so rare that it takes billions of years for the sun to keep going and we try to economize by isolating deuterium and tritium in the laboratory rather than slowly acquiring it. But if all three are squeezed together, they will, for a very short time, result in lithium; but without the connection of the neutrons, they will fall apart very quickly. Lithium 4 decays into helium 3 in 910-23 sec, and Li 3 even less; which makes the helium half-life of 109 sec look quite long in comparison.
because there is a gigantic fusion reaction, instead of a simple combustion. The sun transforms lighter elements into heavier ones, giving off light, heat and energy. Because there is so much sun, it can do this for a very long time.
This is an interesting question. We actually don’t know what stuff looks like, in the sense of “does anyone else experience the same visual sensations as I do?” What matters is the subjective part. We can measure, for example, how the cells in our eyes respond to a certain color. But whether your red is the same as my red, we don’t know. Your red could be my blue subjectively, but there’s no way to find out, because we could agree on everything, but we couldn’t express or show our inner sensations in an objective way. It’s not exactly Eli, but if you’re interested in the subject of how we create reality, you should read up on constructivism, which takes a different view of how we actually create reality in our minds.
And then, it is worth noting that a bonfire in the open air is of course surrounded by space, so there are no surfaces to bounce off. The light in the house bounces off the walls and ceiling, so it appears to go further. Even the fireplace in the house is designed to dissipate heat and light as quickly as possible, so as not to heat up the surrounding surfaces and make them combustible.
1: Take a piece of paper 2: cut out a strip on one of the longer edges. It should not be too thin, nor too wide, about 3 or 4 centimeters will do. 3: turn one of the shorter edges over and, without letting go, glue it to the other end of the strip 3: you will be going back to where you started, though you haven’t been crossing any edges
On top of the dilation of the pupil mentioned by another poster, there is also the reflection on the glass surface: if you're in a room at night and you light a lamp, you will notice that you can clearly see the reflected room on the window but you can't see the outside. This is because the light from the lamp that is reflected by the glass is much more intense than the light coming from outside which is thus cancelled out by the first. The result is that your eye sees only the reflected light and is unable to see the outside.
The hot gas in outer space is dispersed and spreads out when it is not too much of it and when it is left alone. Its molecules just float apart and the pressure of the gas goes to zero. And we know the gas laws: when the pressure goes to zero, so does the temperature. So the gas cools off when this happens. (Remark: well, sort of.) But it doesn't get as close to absolute zero as it would be if there were no radiation at all. (Things cannot really get to absolute zero if there is also no radiation at all coming from outside.) But if there is enough gas, its gravitation takes over and overcomes the spreading-out. Gravity compresses the gas into a smaller space and this makes the pressure rise and the temperature. From such a beginning can come a gas planet like Jupiter or Saturn. And if there is even more gas, it can get so hot inside that fusion starts, and then it's no planet anymore, but a star, a sunlike star.
The difference between a foot parking brake and a handbrake is that the brake pedal is designed to prevent wheel lockup. Moreover, most modern cars have ABS brakes. The brakes on a handbrake are not designed to be used during driving. Indeed, they are specifically designed to lock the wheels, so that it is easier to execute a turn with a handbrake.
Our eyes have three types of cones, each tuned to the wavelengths roughly corresponding to red, green, and blue. Now a purple object is one that has absorbed a lot of the green and reflects blue and red. This stimulates the red and blue cones simultaneously, which your brain translates into a bluish-red sensation, which we call purple.
They fall. But they don’t fall where they were shot, because of the wind. They’re blown off course and they land somewhere else. But there are cases where a bullet shot up in the air has hit a person, it’s quite dangerous. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebratory_firing#Major_incidents
Because light is not the same as heat. Metal is a conductor of heat (among other things).
A nebula requires an element which, when it absorbs a neutron (a subatomic particle) of any energy level, will split into two, releasing energy and further neutrons, which will carry on the reaction. It is not a matter of splitting one atom, but of setting up a chain reaction that can split a quadrillion atoms in a second. There are only a small number of such elements, called ‘fissile’, and of these only two are relatively easy to extract: uranium-235, a kind of uranium that can be separated from natural uranium in special ways, and plutonium-239, an artificially manufactured element that can be created in a kiln. These are not ‘easy’ to extract in any ordinary sense of the word, but are a lot easier than the other fissile elements. There are real physical limits on what is possible. Uranium-238, the most common type of uranium, cannot be used for this purpose, because it can split up, but only when it absorbs a high-energy neutron, and the neutrons created in the splitting of atoms are not sufficiently high-energy to set up a chain reaction in U-238. This is why uranium-235 has to be separated from U-238.
It... isn’t. The most basic law of the universe is that energy is neither created nor destroyed. If you mean to ask, “Why do electrical generators have things that go around and around?” then it’s because of the way we convert one type of energy into another. We use one type of energy—like chemical energy in petroleum or mechanical energy from the wind—to spin a magnet around a conductor. That makes the electrons in the conductor spin. When the electrons are moving, that’s what we call electricity. (Remember that electricity is an action, not a noun.) The easiest way to get something spinning is with a spinning object. Otherwise, you’d have to use something like the carriage return on a typewriter or something even more complicated, less efficient, and harder to build and use. Is that clear?
Physics is a science of laws, engineering is a science of how to use these laws for building. The two are closely related, in the same way as pure mathematics and applied mathematics, biology and medicine, mathematics and computation, but they have different goals. For example, physics gives us the knowledge of the strength of a metal, and why one metal is stronger than another. The science of engineering tells us how to use this strength for building a bridge which will not collapse.
When light strikes an object, part of it reflects (or bounces off). The rest goes through (transmitted) or is absorbed. Black-colored objects absorb most of the visible light that doesn’t bounce off. Those that do bounce off can be shiny if the surface is very smooth or polished. Sometimes gloss is added on purpose, with a clear top coat that increases the reflection before it strikes the black paint and is absorbed.
Because there is not enough hot-melt glue inside them. The transformer is a coil of wire wound around an iron core, and when current flows through the wire, the magnetic field created by the current will make the core squeeze out and the wires be pulled in, and vice versa, with the field inversion. In the case of large transformers on a power pole, this means a few hundred kilograms of metal moving, which is what causes the familiar sound of 50 or 60 Hz. In small transformers, 132 kilohertz is common, so you can't hear the sound of a field switching over, but you can hear the natural vibration of the iron. A thick layer of hot-melt glue will usually solve the problem. It will fix the core to the case and dampen the vibration effectively.
There's an engineering concept called "slip" that measures the slow movement of fasteners, glue, or other construction members from their intended position due to usage, vibrations, thermal expansion, etc. I remember studying it in school to understand why subway tiles eventually fall from the walls and ceilings.
what? It's an inductive thing. Physics is an inductive science, that is, it constructs knowledge from observation and experiment, and the truth of a statement is judged by whether or not it coincides with observation. Therefore, the purpose of physics is to look at the world and formalize it. Therefore, Newton's laws of motion are not deduced in the mathematical sense, but they are axioms. A statement that cannot be mathematically derived is assumed to be true as a starting point for formulating the theory. If it turns out that these axioms do not explain and predict the external world accurately, they are changed or discarded. Newton simply observed the movements of the things and tried to find the equations that would best fit this movement. This is in addition to the assumption that the previous observations and statements of the scholar had been considered.
Nothing. The universe is the expansion of space itself. The concept of space without space does not exist—at least according to the most recent knowledge of physics. For human beings, this is difficult to understand, since we can see and measure only the space in which we live. Likewise, it is difficult for us to imagine four, five, or six dimensions of space, when we are familiar with only three.
They do not exist to distribute water. They exist to keep up the pressure. Why? Because gravity costs nothing. Think of a water tower as a bathtub. You fill it up to the brim, then you open the drain. The tube is then under pressure because of the full bathtub, which means that the water in the bathtub keeps the tube under pressure, and this will remain until the water is completely drained. The water tower works the same way, except that the drain is always open. When the water level is low, the pump takes over and fills the water tower faster than it is drained. Gravity keeps the tube under pressure. That is why water towers are high up and not at ground level. This means that the water tower is always higher than the pipes in the area and thus maintains the pressure. The calculation is simple: it costs a municipality much less to turn on the pump every now and then and put the water in a water tower than to turn on the pump day and night to keep the pipes under pressure.
When the wind is blowing from the opposite side of the house, it flows over the top of it. Since the house isn't aerodynamic, it creates a lower pressure on the other side than the stationary air inside the house. And the air escapes. A fluid like air tends to go from high pressure to low pressure. So since the pressure is very low on the other side of the house, it's like the wind is blowing right out the window.
Sound is nothing but vibration. When you clap your hands, the air around them vibrates and reaches the ears, which then interpret the vibration as sound.
It depends on the degree of scatter. The contrast is simply “light” or “no light”. If the light scatters into the dark zones, you have “light” and “some light” which, intuitively speaking, is less contrast. If all the light scatters, you have “some light” and “some light,” which is zero contrast, and no image.
Speed affects frequency in that more or less of a certain type will pass a given point in a second, and less will pass. That means that frequency is proportional to the speed of the wave. The period is the inverse of the frequency. It is the time that one wave takes to pass through a given point. If the waves move faster, that time will be shorter, if they move slower, it will be longer. Period is inversely proportional to the speed of the wave.
A demonstration would help explain this. Take your children outside and stand still. Slowly turn around and point at the sky. The children have to walk so that you point at them. First they start at your side so that they just have to walk to keep up. Then let them go farther away, keep turning slowly and watch them run to keep up.
It's not necessary. The average home has enough ventilation. Homes are relatively airtight for energy efficiency reasons. The insulating of a home is primarily based on preventing heat radiation and direct heat transfer through the walls and windows, not on convection. The air in a home carries an incredibly small amount of heat, so replacing it throughout the day is not so important. If you notice a draft, that's obviously a problem, but it's not necessary for sufficient ventilation. The air humidity becomes a greater concern than CO2 if you never open a window or go outside.
Black is a lack of color, while white is the presence of every color. That’s my understanding.
The wiper switch is located on the steering wheel, not far from the explosive that triggers the airbag. The switch often gets broken and stuck on after an explosion.
Smaller atoms may not experience aging but larger ones do. Larger atoms experience radioactive decay. Also, they lose energy over time. The energy loss is not as obvious as the radioactive decay. The Second Law of Thermodynamics is a way of explaining this, if you don’t know it.
The energy that repels two magnets is the energy you put in when you put them together; it is analogous to the energy a stretched spring gives back. It doesn't last forever, because magnets lose their magnetism with time, but since it does not cost energy to maintain the magnetic field, there is no fundamental limit to how long they can be kept in that state. A good magnet might last for thousands of years.
It’s the rails, they literally corrode away. The rail gun and the gauss gun are often confused but they are quite different, so let me be clear what we’re talking about. The coil gun has an electric current running through coils to create a powerful magnetic field that can accelerate an iron projectile. The rail gun has two conductive rails that a conductive projectile or sled slides down, the current runs down the rails, goes through the projectile, back up the rail, and it’s this that’s a problem. The projectile doesn’t have very good electrical contact with the rails so an arc forms and corrodes the rail down the length of the barrel, reducing its service life. The navy’s experimental model used to burn out the rails after a few shots, later they said they lasted 400 shots, but it’s not known how powerful those shots were. The rails also generate a powerful magnetic field when a current runs down them, and they move away from each other, so you need large bolts to hold them together.
In a way, yes. Generally speaking, the rule of thumb ‘bigger boat = less effected by waves’ is true from one point of view but fails dismally from another. So, in a nutshell, small boats have little mass. The mass of the water in motion and its momentum are great and have a huge effect on small boats, on many ships. They can literally transport mountains of moving steel through the water and lift up battleships and aircraft carriers if the sea gets bad enough. With increased mass, waves have a decreasing effect, until they reach a significant size. While we can always build bigger ships, the seas can always produce bigger waves. Ships so big that they would cross an oceanic stretch many square miles wide would be greatly effected by the changing tides and waves on many fronts. The genius that it would take to build a floating island would have to deal not only with the water but also with the specific gravity of the water, the air pressure, the temperature of the air and water, to prevent the ocean from swallowing this hypothetical floating island. The bigger the thing is, the more forces are at play against it. And they don’t always operate evenly.
Take a piece of buttered bread and strap it to a cat, butter facing outwards. Lift the cat by its collar and let it go. As it is an axiom of the universe that buttered bread will fall buttered-side-down, so another axiom states that cats always land on their feet. When you combine the two together, dropping the combination will of course nullify the effect of one of the laws of the universe, which will of course result in the contravention of the second law. It is only the interruption of the law of the universe by a dog or a manga character late for school that would affect the course of the cat.
Traditionally it has been part of physics, but the parts of physics involved in it simply migrated to engineering. The advantages of flow, turbulence, etc., modelling are absolutely priceless for virtually all kinds of machinery, vehicles, medical appliances, and so on. It is as relevant to everyday life (and to government interests...) as are improvements in electronics. And therefore most of the research is conducted or out-sourced by engineering companies, often with major governmental military budgets. Continuum mechanics does have some importance in the context of outer space, for instance it plays a crucial role in explaining the formation of our own solar system from spinning gas and dust. Recently there has been some discussion about whether the solar system has a shockwave, since space itself is on the scale of the shockwave a weak continuum. But such theory about space is, of course, much less relevant to everyday life (and big guns) and is rather something cool for research establishments to play with. And this is what physics is more and more becoming—researching cool, but more esoteric stuff.
It really can’t. What heater are you referring to? They might be inefficient for some uses (say, drying leaves in the winter), but not for others (say, making soup in the summer). But you’re right that all that electricity is just wasted as heat.
- Oesophagus is muscular tube and it stretches towards stomach by peristaltic movement of its wall, like an worm in the ground which has no limbs. So it is possible to eat upside down. But I don’t think it is comfortable.
It's to help separate the dirt from the air. Particles of dust are heavier than air and so they can't go around as fast as the air swirling around the vortex. So instead of all the dust stopping up on the filter, most of it sticks to the outside walls, increasing the amount of dust the vacuum can pick up before it clogs up.
The bacilli produce the poison as a by-product of their digestive processes. That is no more a violation of the first law of thermodynamics than your eating, urinating, and defecating.
You can. But you’ll have to carry all that fuel with you, so there’ll be a lot more mass to accelerate, which means a lot more fuel. But in theory, if you had a sufficiently efficient engine or if you had an external source of fuel to supply you as you accelerate, you could go pretty fast. At some point, the effects of special relativity would take over and the faster you go, the heavier you get, and then you’d need even more fuel to accelerate yourself, and that’s more advanced stuff for you.
Newtonian motion, in which an object is attracted to a target and retained by the centrifugal force of its own weight; the atoms are the atoms in which they are found. The force of an atom's nucleus is like a stretched-out rubber band which will snap back when you pull on it, or give it a thump with a bat, or a gamma ray. This effect can be produced with far less energy than that. Generally speaking, ionizing radiation is everything from ultra-violet C rays through X-rays to gamma rays. And they all have enough energy to break off an atom's nucleus and fling it outwards, but for less energetic radiation, the most you can do is to absorb it, then transform that energy into movement (wobblier atoms) or into light (things that glow under a black light).
No. The engines of planes don't work without oxygen to light the fuel and air to pull through the rotors, so they can't fly in space. But yes, if a plane somehow reaches the right speed at the right height, like the ISS, then it too will continue to fall (or rather continue to circle the earth). Anything will do that. That's why all the satellites and the moon don't crash. Or why the earth itself doesn't crash into the sun. In the atmosphere, there's no way to fly without engines. Friction slows everything down, and the whole business of keeping your speed so you can fall and circle the earth doesn't work. If you're not lighter than air, you need some kind of power to keep you up. The ISS doesn't have enough to keep it up.
It is not that they do not touch each other but that they repel each other. In other words, one atom pushes another, which pushes another, and so on.
We do get more energy every day, but we don't keep it. We and all the other things on earth constantly radiate and lose the energy we get from the sun, it is just a passing thing for us. To keep this energy, we have to convert it into something more permanent. This is possible for plants by means of photosynthesis. Light + water = more plant. The sun's energy, which hit the leaf, is now stored in the new plant that grows from it. On top of that, there is also a photovoltaic method, i.e. the panels that catch and store the energy of the sun, by converting sunlight into electricity. A: A lot of the energy we get from the sun warms up our planet during the day and is lost again at night. The atmosphere prevents us from completely losing our heat and freezing to death during this short time, until the sun rises again the next day and heats the other side of the earth. Then it all happens again. If the sun suddenly disappeared and the night lasted forever, we would quickly lose all the heat trapped by the atmosphere and freeze to space temperature of -180 ° C. Good thing that the sun still rises every day and warms us up!
1. The deterioration is cumulative. So it's not just a matter of X pieces failing in a given time, but a disproportionate number of parts that have failed, and the cost of launching things into space is already prohibitive. 2. Not everything can be fixed in space. The station is a complex piece of equipment and it may simply not be possible to get hold of the parts needed to replace all the faulty ones. 3. If it ends up having to be replaced, then why not make use of the advances in technology to replace the whole station with something better? This would require diverting resources from the current station to a new one.
Imagine the fluid as a group of molecules. When the channel is wide, many molecules can go through it at once, but when it's narrow, only a few can go through. To keep the flow at the same rate, more molecules must pass through the narrow space in the same time, so the molecules move faster.
We see it in many charts and diagrams. If you have made a trip and drew a line on a map, that line is a representation of your trip through space (across the map) and it is also a representation of your trip through time, as it is impossible for you to be anywhere else on the line during the course of the trip. If you plot the population of a country over the years, the population is shown moving through time. These are the everyday examples of movement through time. In physics, the mathematics are more complex, but the meaning is really not much different from the examples above. There are some non-intuitive concepts in physics that emerge in connection with very heavy objects (with very high gravitation) and very high velocities. In everyday life, we tend to think of time as “absolute”—everybody keeps the same clock. Einstein’s theory and experiments show that movement through space affects movement through time. Time is relative to the observer. But a deeper understanding requires some college physics.
By theoretic considerations, they are already pulled down by gravity now, but they have enough lateral momentum to not crash into the Earth. Thus, the thing that pulls them down is slowing down. At the altitude of a satellite, for example, there is a very slight drag from the very top of the atmosphere, and after a hundred years or so, the object will gradually slow down and crash into the earth. The things which are much higher in the orbit, like the moon and certain satellites, can stay in orbit for billions of years without getting disturbed.
(the molecules) – atoms move in many ways, they vibrate, they spin, they move from one place to another, and this all goes to the concept of hotness and coldness. If something is hot, it means that the atoms in it are vibrating, spinning or moving faster than in cold. But this concept of hot and cold is not quite a physical concept. The atoms can move (as described above). Movement is energy, and so a moving atom has more energy than a non-moving atom. And a faster moving atom has more energy than a slower moving atom. We call this energy heat, and this heat can be converted into temperature. But what makes 40°F cold and 100°F hot? If I invented a new temperature scale and told you that it was 800° on that scale, you wouldn't know if it was "hot" or "cold". And that's because hot and cold are sensations created by the brain. When something with temperature touches your body, this temperature (heat) makes the nerves of your skin twitches, which sends chemical and electrical signals to your brain, which in turn creates a sensation of hot or cold. Why are we digging this dungeon? Because the key to why the wind is hot or cold lies in this. You do not feel the cold or heat of an object only by its temperature, but by the effect it has on your body's ability to reject heat. Remember that we are warm-blooded beings and always generate heat, which we have to reject or we will be overheated and die. And this is important because the wind has more energy than the calm air, which should have a higher temperature, but you feel the wind as a colder feeling than the calm air. Not a paradox? No, because in the calm air, the air next to your body is warmed by your body and does not go anywhere, so it is equal to your skin temperature. Then your body cannot reject any more heat and begins to heat up. You feel the "warmth". But in the wind, the air next to your body is constantly being blown away and replaced by new air, which allows your body to constantly reject heat and transfer it to the new air, so you feel the "coolness". Although the wind can be hotter than the calm air, the feeling of cold or heat is not just about the temperature of the air, but also about how well or how bad you can reject the heat that your body generates at all times.
The International Bureau of the Metric System (BIPM), which is responsible for the official definition of the metric system, has been making efforts to establish the system of the metric system in accordance with the fundamental properties of the universe. Earlier, the metre was defined by the radius of the earth, which is fine for the earth, but if we want to settle on other planets, we need an absolute standard. In 1983 the definition of the metre was changed to "the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a tenth of a second." We know that the speed of light is 299,792,458 metres per second and that it does not change. Now we base the length of the metre on the speed of light.
Suppose you wear gloves. Even though you never actually touch the item, you can feel its texture. The glove acts as a force-transmitter between the item and your hand. With a thick glove, it’s even hard to feel slight differences in the surface of the item. But if there is a larger difference, you can feel it easily. Texture is nothing but the surface of the item and how it responds to the force of your hand. So with thin gloves you can feel any texture. The “glove” of the attractive forces of atoms is just a few atoms thick.
The windshield is not completely flat. It curves like a water glass or a lens. And just as with a water glass or a lens, it makes the light curve. Therefore, at this point, the road seems to curve down.
Light moves at that speed because it is the limit, not the other way around. All massless phenomena, especially information about any events, is limited to this speed, and light is just an example of this limit (since photons are massless). Perhaps a more appropriate term would be “the speed of causality” or “the ratio between length and time.”
