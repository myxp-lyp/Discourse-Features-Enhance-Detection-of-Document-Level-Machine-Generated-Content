Caffeine does not give you energy, not even a little bit. What it does is make you not notice that you’re tired. You’re still tired and your body suffers all the disadvantages of tiredness, but you can’t notice it. Moreover, if you drink too much caffeine too often your body gets used to it so that you don’t notice the usual amount of tiredness unless you’ve had caffeine. If you don’t, for example when you get up in the morning, you won’t be able to rouse yourself without caffeine.
As far as I know, there are only two instances when the consumption of alcohol is medically necessary—as in truly medicinally—beneficial. In both cases, however, only in small doses. First, when an alcoholic attempts to withdraw from alcohol, he can die, literally die from lack of alcohol. Secondly, the ingestion of methyl alcohol is fatal, but not the methyl alcohol itself but the compound which the body breaks down into, which is deadly. If one drinks alcohol, ordinary alcohol that is, the body will digest the alcohol and pass the methyl alcohol harmlessly.
The bend line is formed by tiny cracks and cracks. Light travels through the different sections of the material and air in the sections and gets scattered and appears white. Similar to frosted glass, i.e. glass with very tiny scratches, and water droplets in clouds.
Despite what some people may have said, defining the surface area of something like activated charcoal does, in fact, involve a phenomenon that is precisely analogous to the problem of the coastline paradox. You measure the surface area of a porous surface by effectively covering it with molecules of known dimensions. The number of molecules required to cover it tells you how much surface you have. The size of the molecules determines how small the corners and nooks can be that they can fill. That is, if you are using a large molecule to measure a surface with a large number of very small nooks and crannies, then you will understate the surface area. There are materials that have a surface area of several thousand square meters per gram of material. This is much greater than you could ever get by simply adding up the surface area of spheres covering it.
There are little rotors inside the pump nozzle, which the liquid soap strikes on the way out of the dispenser!
Oil, coal, natural gas, and most other ground-based hydrocarbons are the decomposed remains of sea life (or forests) that existed millions of years ago and died before fungus had developed to digest them. The soil and water at that time contained a lot of sulphur and phosphorus from the atmosphere, which is what those living things ate, and so end up in the coal, oil, or gas. When the extraction process starts, the gases naturally release and if there's water around they react with it and produce hydrogen sulphide, sulphur dioxide, and sulphuric acid, which really smells bad. When they drill down into an oil well, they naturally drill through a relatively dense pocket of these gases, which is why there's that "jet of oil" effect in the movies (because the pocket of oil is literally pressurized) and like any other liquid locked up with pressurized gas, some of that gas is going to stay in the liquid, (think of a two-liter bottle of coke, and the gas coming out is natural gas, hydrogen sulphide, etc.) Most offshore oil rigs have a big flare stack, where they can vent any gases that come out of the well. There's no way to treat them out in the open sea, and releasing them as CO2 is a lot less harmful to the environment than releasing methane. There are a few states that allow this kind of thing, like in California.
Because they're polar molecules. The molecule is curved and has unequally distributed electrons. Although the molecule is neutral in its overall charge, there are small positive and small negative areas within the molecule.
The sunlight refracted into a rainbow is still visible light, only its wavelengths are scattered slightly in different directions. None of the visible wavelengths is any more dangerous than all the visible wavelengths combined in white light.
, A large part of the burning sensation is caused by the hydration of the water in the skin itself. So in order to avoid further injury, it is best to stop all burning sensations quickly—both chemical and thermal. Now, if you were to drop water on the sulphuric acid on your skin, you could make the heat burns worse. But if you can spray the area with a high ratio of water to acid, you’ll probably have a net benefit. Water has a high capacity to absorb heat.
the salt does not melt the ice. It lowers the freezing point of water. Technically, if the temperature is lowered sufficiently, salt water freezes.
The stickyness clings to the tape. At first. Later it clings to something else, to paper, to the wall, to the humidity in the air, to dust.
Ultraviolet light can damage the DNA of a cell, which destroys its functionality and eventually kills the cell. It also produces some ozone, which is extremely harmful to cells. It is used for cleaning because it is a very gentle method of disinfecting objects, and does not require toxic or dangerous chemicals.
Alcohol is poisonous. The liver is designed to change poisonous alcohol into harmless acetic acid. This acetic acid can even be converted into harmless carbon dioxide, thus releasing useful energy — which is why alcohol has calories. Unfortunately, there is a hiccup in the process. Alcohol cannot be converted directly into acetic acid; first it must be converted into something called acetaldehyde, which is far more poisonous than alcohol. The steps that your body goes through after drinking alcohol depend on the ratio of alcohol to acetaldehyde in the blood. When you drink, you have lots of alcohol in the blood and not much acetaldehyde, so you go through the alcohol phase and experience the effects of alcohol, such as not being able to think properly. On the other hand, during a hangover, the alcohol is now largely acetaldehyde, so your brain is no longer inhibited by alcohol and so you have a combination of acetaldehyde poisoning, the effects of dehydration, sleep deprivation, and a host of other individual annoyances which occur at the same time.
When you cut an onion, a gas is released that, on contact with the water in your eye, forms an acid that burns.
What you see is the sum of all the colour pigments in the liquid. Coffee is a dark brown, almost black. Milk is white. Add some milk and the two pigments combine to make a new colour, one that is a lighter brown than the dark brown.
But when the electricity passes through water, it’s not the water that becomes dangerous—it’s the electricity. Our bodies use the differences in electrical charge between cells to conduct nerve signals, and electricity is a huge source of electrical charge. So when electricity passes through a person’s body, it causes all sorts of electrical signals to fire at once. The muscles contract, the senses get thrown off balance, etc. This can be extremely dangerous to the functions that need to be controlled constantly, like the heart. And that’s not all: when electricity passes through anything, it encounters resistance, which causes heat to build up. Eventually, enough electricity passing through the body creates enough heat to cook the tissue and damage it by denaturing the protein molecules and chemically altering the cells forever. Electricity can burn through a human being’s body like a torch—which is why electricity is normally so dangerous. But how come it’s so dangerous when it’s in water? Water conducts electricity. Well, technically it needs a certain amount of dissolved salts or other ions, but since the water isn’t normally very distilled, it can be considered a good conductor of electricity if you want to be picky. So now, instead of a dangerous wire, you’ve got a dangerous fluid that covers a much larger area and can spread out in unexpected ways. And of course you don’t know whether it’s safe or not because it looks like harmless water, but the electricity that passes through you is on its way to the ground through you. And yes, if you disconnect the electricity, the water becomes harmless at once (as long as it’s not too hot). Think about it: if you disconnect the electricity from a wire, the wire is immediately safe to touch because it hasn’t become a dangerous material.
When we say "touch," we usually mean 'bump into'. Even though they don't touch, they can interact, and if this interaction is a high one, we say "sticky." Touching is bad. It's called fusion.
The simplest answer is that cookie dough is a collection of biochemicals (sugars and sugar polymers, proteins, fats, etc.), and if you kept heating it up, those big molecules would start dissolving into smaller molecules, until the chemical composition was changed so much that it no longer qualified as cookie dough. High enough temperatures will melt just about everything except lumps of carbon, which do not melt at any temperature at normal atmospheric pressure. You can’t melt cookie dough, because it would cease to be cookie dough before you reached the melting point of its components.
Its value lies in its energy density. You can set fire to it and get lots of energy, but to get energy-dense molecules, you need to input energy into the system. First by the plankton that dies and produces carbon-dense sediment, then over millions of years by geological conditions that impose high temperatures and pressures on the sediments for a long time. If you want to do this artificially, you need to input that energy, and you have to put in more energy than you'll get out. So it's an inefficient process.
Many dishwashers dry the dishes by heating up a coiled wire in the dishwasher. This wire can get so hot that it can warp certain plastics or damage the enamel on cups and dishes. Usually this coiled wire is placed on the bottom of the dishwasher, so the top rack gets less heat. This is why certain dishes are “top rack only.”
The bubbles you see on the surface of boiling water are not air. They’re only water that has become hot enough to turn into steam.
Gas (in this case CO2) dissolved in a liquid. The better the gas is dissolved, the more it will be able to disperse. If the gas is dispersed, it forms bubbles and floats to the surface. If a drink is shaken up, the CO2 forms bubbles and floats to the surface. It is not unusual for winemakers to use a de-gassing machine (something like a drill-mounted paint shaker) to remove the CO2 from the wine between fermentation and bottling.
No. But when you look into it more closely, you'll find there are some very small deviations due to two phenomena. * The binding energy of nucleons. * E = mc2 According to E = mc2, whatever loses energy loses mass. If the nucleus of sodium is a bit more stable (in other words, more strongly bound), the nucleus will lose less energy and therefore less mass. Likewise, if the nucleus is a bit more unstable (lower binding energy) than carbon's (the standard) it will lose more energy and therefore more mass. Hence it is lighter than 23. * The natural distribution of isotopes. * Sodium may be most abundant in the form of 23 AMU, but there may also be some 22 or 23 AMU (that's, with one or two more or less of the usual number of neutrons) and less abundant in the form of 21 AMU. That would affect the precise figure, because you'd have to take an average of them. In reality, sodium's nucleus is a bit more stable than carbon's (as a rule, stability increases from H to Fe and decreases from there onwards). Moreover, sodium is a monoisotopic element, that is, it has only one relevant isotope on earth. So the second phenomenon is disregarded for sodium, and its AMU would be a little less than 23. It's 22.98976928 (source)
It all depends on how it's ice! If you put a tray of water in the chiller, the cold first touches the outside water. That's what freezes first. When the water gets colder, it can hold less air; a few of the air in the water will be released into bubbles. And when the ice is frozen from the outside in, these bubbles are stuck in the ice, so it's cloudy. Now, an ice-maker usually uses a cold finger that lets the ice freeze from the inside out, so if there are bubbles in the water, they are carried away by the water jet and the ice remains clear. That's why the restaurant ice gets those holes. Edit: After further research, I learned that although the above still applies, the other main role is played by the impurities, minerals and such, in the water. The ice freezes as crystals, the crystals try to push the impurities out. Freezing from the outside in, the impurities are pushed in and piled up in the middle. Freezing from the inside out, they escape with the water that flows out.
When you eat, you digest it in your stomach. But the small molecules still have to go through the cells of your stomach to get into your bloodstream. The molecules need to fit through certain channels to do this. If they don’t fit, they don’t get absorbed. Some zero-calorie sweeteners are similar enough to sugar to taste sweet, but too different to fit through the channels. Other zero-calorie sweeteners are so good at stimulating your taste buds that a tiny, tiny amount tastes as sweet as a lot of real sugar. But there’s so little of it in your food or drink that it’s pretty much like you’re not eating any calories at all.
Your entire body is constantly working to keep its internal balance, and it’s more complicated than just getting rid of the bad and keeping the good. You can compare it to a puzzle, and you’re not allowed to leave empty spaces in the puzzle. If you’re trying to get rid of sodium, you have to replace it with something else similar enough to the sodium to go there. For example, if you want to get rid of some sodium, you have to try to fit something else into the space that would have been occupied by the sodium. While water may help with the symptoms of dehydration and cramps, it doesn’t provide the pieces necessary to fill the space where the sodium was. Those will still have to be taken from elsewhere. Therefore, a large excess of sodium places a severe strain on the body. The high level of sodium can cause the loss of certain nutrients that are no longer absorbed because there’s no room, it can strain the kidneys, which have to get rid of large quantities of the mineral on a daily basis when they don’t have enough pieces to get rid of it, and it can end up causing even more imbalances as other pieces are shuffled to keep everything in balance. The body also holds on to water to prevent those immediate problems caused by the sodium—dehydration and cramps. But that doesn’t fix the underlying problem. (TLDR — High levels of sodium are like playing a game of Tetris with lots of one piece and almost none of the others.) You may try to adjust, but eventually you’ll end up with more and more pieces that are nothing but sodium, and you’ll have to get rid of them. Water doesn’t give you the pieces necessary to deal with a puzzle full of sodium, and it even clutters up the board more by attaching itself to the sodium.
White gold is alloyed with white metals such as nickel, while yellow gold is alloyed with yellow metals such as copper.
For fire to exist, three things are needed: heat, fuel, and oxygen. There’s no random fuel in the air, and heat quickly falls off as you get farther from the flame. Oxygen, though, is the most abundant thing in the air. Luckily, the other two, fortunately, aren’t.
Covalent bonds occur when atoms share a pair of shared electrons. The two atoms stick together because they are grabbing the same shared electrons. Ionic bonds are no sharing. They just take the electrons from each other. That means one atom is negatively charged and the other is positively charged. They are kept together by the electrostatic force that attracts negative charge to positive charge, as if the two ions were just a big proton and a big electron. Molecular compounds are basically small compounds in which individual molecules are isolated from each other and are not physically linked to each other. This is different from a macromolecule or macrostructure, which is like one big molecule with no boundaries, because everything is stuck together. For example, silica, the main ingredient in quartz, has the formula SiO2, but quartz is not a bunch of individual SiO2 molecules huddled together. It's like a big mesh of Si and O atoms. Each Si atom is linked to four O atoms, and each O atom to two Si atoms, and each of those Si atoms to four O atoms, and each of those O atoms to two Si atoms, and each of those Si atoms to four O atoms, and so on, and so on, and so on. So the formula does not mean that there are separate SiO2 molecules, but that there are twice as many O atoms as Si. O2, for example, is molecular. O2 does not form large circles where each oxygen atom is linked to two other oxygen atoms. In this case you do have individual O2 molecules. Generally, ionic compounds are macromolecular.
If water is heated to 100°C, it does not get any hotter. @@@ Adding energy to it only makes it evaporate, not heat up. But the boiling point of oil is much higher. Adding energy to it will make it heat up. When you see bubbles in the oil, most of them are the water evaporating from the food.
(epI1) Radiation consists essentially of alpha, beta, and gamma rays. A positron is something different, and belongs to particle physics. That is to say, it is a helium atom devoid of an electron, an electric ray (like light, but more dangerous), or simply a radioactive ray.
Better results. Some things, like bread, can become chewy when they’re cooked in a microwave, but other things can dry out too much in an oven, making them too dry and hard. Both ways are good, and it depends on what you’re cooking.
The first discovery of metals is not recorded in history, because it occurred in prehistoric times. Probably someone had thrown some metal-rich rock into the fire, and then the typical "manly" camp-fire was made, with more heat than necessary. The next morning, the ores were found to have melted and the ash was pure copper.
unny dust is what you get when cooking oil vapors get blown out from open saucepans, and then lands on nearby surfaces, where it mixes with dust.
A vast quantity of water must be frozen. This requires an enormous amount of energy, making it incredibly expensive. The problem is not a technical one but an economic one. Many of the areas threatened with loss of freshwater do not have the means to build a large-scale desalination plant.
It is true that vitamins and other nutrients are lost during cooking. But it depends on the cooking method and even after cooking a lot of vitamins and nutrients remain that your body needs for good health, assuming you have a balanced diet. Some cooking methods even help you to absorb nutrients better. Meat and other fatty foods, however, may lose some of their nutrients during cooking, but it all depends on the method of cooking. Anyway, we cook meat because it is generally not safe to eat it raw.
I don’t understand the question. But in the end, it doesn’t make much difference. Hot water has a high energy, cold water has a low energy. When you mix them, they will divide the difference. Cold water heats up, warm water cools down, and then the energy is divided equally. It is not possible that half the water heats up faster than the other half cools down. This would go against the first law of thermodynamics.
Millions and billions are spent on developing drugs. Most drugs when they come to the market are patented and only the company that owns the patent can manufacture and sell it until the patent expires. This is the reason why we have generic drugs, the generics are made after the expiration of the patent. The cost of developing the drug is passed on to the consumers in the price of the drug during the time it is under patent. For example, I used to take a medication that was not available in generic form and if I didn’t have insurance it would have cost me $9,000 a month. I went to a pharmacy that sold generics and they were available for only $145 a month (without insurance).
Water can evaporate below boiling point. The molecules of water are different speeds; the very fastest can escape even at a temperature below boiling. This happens with everything wet; when you wipe yourself with a towel and leave it hanging for a while, it will get dry. The reason you see the steam is that the air is very cold and therefore not able to hold a lot of steam. Consequently, the water molecules that have left your wet clothes will immediately re-condense into tiny liquid droplets in the air. These tiny droplets are what you see as steam.
Pure potassium being a very reactive element would like to violently bond with another element. That’s what makes it dangerous, but the potassium in bananas is part of a molecule, meaning it has already bonded with something else. That’s why it’s harmless. Also the chlorine in salt doesn’t kill you because it’s bound to something else. The potassium in bananas does make them slightly radioactive, but you should still eat them. You get ten times more radiation from a conventional tube TV than from a banana. It’s perfectly safe. As bananas are measurable in radioactivity, physicists often joke about BEDs, the banana equivalent of a body dose. That means how many bananas would you have to eat to get the same amount of radiation as from a chest X-ray? It would take about 10,000 bananas to equal one BED.
Depending on the reaction, a catalyst is sometimes consumed as an intermediate product. Suppose there are three reactions between A, B, and C: 1) A + B = AB, 2) A + C = AC, and 3) AC + B = AB + C. It is easy to see that, when the three elements are mixed, the reaction is: A + B + C = AC + B = AB + C. C has been the catalyst.
* A *lot *of *different *chemicals *are used – I can’t give you a list of them all. This is a list of strawberry flavourings, for example:
A sensor that looks for sulphur in the air can probably detect bad breath. Sulphur (S) is the foul smell of morning breath, onions and farts. There are breath sensors out there that react to certain chemicals in the exhaled breath. Odor is not a quality of food, but a sense. If you can smell something, the gas particles go up the nose and are captured by the olfactory sensors in the nose. The bad breath sensors could probably find the chemicals that the bacteria in the mouth excrete, which are responsible for the odor (which people consider bad).
Opioids fit into the opiate-receptor sites in the brain like a key in a lock. Naloxone closes the lock. It is more technical than that, but that’s the gist of it.
Sunscreen works by blocking and absorbing UV rays, using a combination of physical and chemical particles. Physical particles like zinc or titanium are used to deflect the UV rays from the skin.
The color of flames depends on two things: the composition of the fuel and the temperature of the flame. Wood is the commonest fuel, and since it burns at a relatively low temperature, its flame is orange and yellow. A higher temperature produces a lighter flame. Add other fuels to a flame, and the color changes to red, green, blue, etc.
H2 lacks an electron, acidity is the concentration of H+, i.e., hydrogen atoms deprived of their electron, a single nucleus, a proton and a neutral. There’s nothing that the proton and the neutral want more than an extra electron, so they snatch one with force. And in the process the “donor” loses an electron, becomes an ion, and dissolves.
Alchemy is the medieval name for chemistry, based on the alleged transmutation of matter, and was primarily occupied with attempts to transmute base metals into gold, or to find a universal panacea. Part of it was humbug, but the greater part was chemistry.
The toaster takes the moisture out of the bread. It also burns the sugar in the bread, which gives the bread a brown color. This reaction is called the Maillard reaction, which gives the surface of grilled or fried meat a brownish black color, but inside the meat is still lighter.
Yes, because pressure cookers work by putting the food under pressure. That increases the boiling point of water, allowing more heat to be applied to the food and, therefore, cooking it faster. Certain chemical reactions—which is what cooking is—don't occur at lower temperatures, or at least not as quickly. This could result in different textures or tastes when cooking at higher temperatures. You can offset some of these by managing the cooking time better, but they will still occur. In most cases, the time savings from using a pressure cooker outweigh any downsides.
All you really need is a small amount of fluoride to strengthen the enamel, and the rest is just a mild abrasive to help you clean the deposits. Everything else is marketing. In terms of toothpaste, it’s really up to personal taste. Brushing and rinsing are enough to keep your mouth healthy. Two things I would recommend: an ultrasonic electric toothbrush, which seems to work better than regular hand brushing. A tongue scraper, just a cheap, simple plastic one, is also effective in cleaning off the deposits on your tongue and freshening your breath.
so that they are all incorporated. You don’t want a piece of the cake to have all the baking powder, or salt, or sugar. They have to be incorporated, so that they also participate in the chemical reaction that the mixture is about to undergo.
They used to do laboratory tests to find out. Then they’d burn it to see how many calories it had. Nowadays they just calculate how many nutrients were in the individual ingredients (which had already been tested in a laboratory and averaged), and they add them up.
“The bubbles are hiding in the liquid, and they come out when everyone has gone. The carbon dioxide is dissolved in the liquid. Under higher pressure, the liquid can hold more dissolved substances, and when the pressure is relieved when opening the bottle or can, the dissolved carbon dioxide is converted into a gas and forms bubbles.
Carbon is very good at absorbing things. So it's really good at sticking stuff to its surface, such as poisons. Charcoal is mostly carbon. That's why it's black. It's also very porous, so it's very light and easy to crush. So it has lots of surface area. Ten charcoal tablets have a combined surface area of the whole of a soccer field. And the more surface there is, the more you can absorb. Note that charcoal is only *mostly* carbon. And there's a big difference between'mostly carbon' and 'all carbon'. Ordinary charcoal, the kind that you get when you burn wood, contains tar and all sorts of other nasty things. And the worst thing is that the surface and, especially, the pores of the normal charcoal are almost completely blocked by these nasty things. So most of the surface of the charcoal is completely useless. It can't be used to soak up anything. It's true that charcoal can soak up a lot (it's good enough, for example, to purify mash before final distillation), but it could soak up a lot more if you took away all the tar. This tar-removing procedure is called 'activating' the charcoal. The end result is a charcoal that's not only carbon, but 'pure' carbon. All its pores are clear and can absorb stuff. UPDATE: Got a few questions in ITT, so I'll answer them here. a) Adsorb is a real word. It means the same as 'absorb', but the poison sticks to the surface of the adsorbent instead of being absorbed into the inside of the absorbent. There's no real practical difference between the two words, unless you're a chemist. But I like to use 'proper' words for chemical things. And that includes using the right word, even when the wrong one would do. b) Toxins are poisons that are made inside living organisms. Botulin and penicillin are toxins. Mercurous chloride is not. Whether methylmercury is a toxin or not is a matter of opinion. There is no chemical property that makes something toxic. Capsaicin is not toxic to us, but to some insects it's a deadly neurotoxin. Yes, I'm aware that 'toxin' is just a word that's used by companies and people to sell useless stuff to people who don't know any better. No, I'm not going to stop using the word. It's a good word, and it means exactly what I think it means. I don't give a damn what anyone else does with it, or why. c) The category I called 'things like toxins' would be better called 'poisons, drugs and vitamins'. Charcoal doesn't care, it just takes up whatever it finds. d) It's called 'activated' rather than 'pure' because 'pure' would require a separate 'ELI5' explanation to *every customer*, because *everyone* (except a small number of chemists) would wonder why it was better than ordinary charcoal. In the days before the Internet, this would have been a very expensive process. But nowadays, anyone with a connection to the Internet can find out how activated charcoal works for themselves. UPDATE2: I've already answered another frequently-asked question about how charcoal is activated, here. That's not an *exact* answer, but there are some good YouTube videos about the whole process, and there's one here: Now I see that I should probably have just linked to this from the start. It explains it all very clearly, and shows the difference between ordinary charcoal and activated charcoal using a iodine test. UPDATE3: There seems to be some large-scale quackery that I'm not aware of. People seem to be getting angry enough to ignore points b) and c) above, and yell at me about things that I've already made clear about ten times already. So I'll restate them, more strongly. e) Whatever the quacks or 'health gurus' may say, activated charcoal DOES NOT HAVE ANY MAGICAL PROPERTIES. The only things it can do is soak up poisons that are already in your stomach. For example, if you've eaten some mouldy food, activated charcoal will soak up the poisonous stuff in the mould. But it will also soak up everything else that isn't water, a short-chain alcohol or an inorganic salt. This includes vitamins and nutrients. So using it as a supplement is a bad idea. You probably don't get enough vitamins as it is, so don't reduce the small amount you already get by drinking adsorbents when you don't need to. In other words, if you drink activated charcoal, you'll probably poop out most of the poisons in your stomach without absorbing any of them. The only reason I said 'things like toxins' is that that's what Russian doctors use it for: absorbing poisons from food. Not inorganic heavy metals, for example, because charcoal is not very good at soaking them up. There are other things that are better at that. They only use activated charcoal in an emergency, like when someone's eaten something bad or drunk too much of some other drug. But, like anyone with even a basic knowledge of chemistry, they know that charcoal just soaks up everything. So, now that I've made my opinion clear, I would like to ask you all to stop telling me that activated charcoal has no magical properties. I know that already.
The blood-brain barrier is a second line of defense between everything that circulates in your blood and your brain because the brain is really important and your body needs to protect it to keep you alive. The barrier is made to keep out dangerous molecules, and that includes drugs, too. Meds that can’t cross the blood brain barrier often have little or no effect on the brain because they can’t reach it. But some meds can still have a strong effect even if they don’t hit brain cells and histamines. Older antihistamines like Benadryl affect the histamines in the brain, which can make you sleepy and foggy-brained. Newer antihistamines like Claritin don’t affect the histamines in the brain at all and don’t make you sleepy or foggy. Because they don’t cross the barrier as easily, they don’t have the same effect.
Vinegar is a natural, edible acid, as lemon juice is. It is dissolved in water and other liquids, which gives it flavor and makes it useful for cooking. Unlike lemon juice, vinegar is produced by the fermentation of yeast. Like lemon juice, vinegar is also useful as a cleaner. Because vinegar is unfavorable for most germs, it can be used as a preservative, but it will affect the taste of the preserved food.
Sugar in general is very stable under the conditions of the surroundings, and does not decompose, or only after a very long time (as long as years or decades) if the bottle is closed. If the bottle is open, the sugar will eventually be eaten away by bacteria and fungi. To answer your question, No, it will not decompose on its own. Sugar-free beverages do not contain sugar at all, but are sweetened with other sweeteners. If you want to get the sugar out of a purchased product (for whatever reason you may do this), I can think of only one way of doing it: the use of the right kind of enzymes. The sugar is broken down into smaller molecules, which no longer taste sweet and which do not have the high energy content that sugar has. However, it would be necessary to remove the enzymes again afterwards by settling and filtration. It should be noted that the action of the enzymes is confined to a certain temperature and a certain pH value. It will therefore take some experimentation to find the right kind of enzymes (preferably commercially available) for the product you want to get rid of the sugar in.
How do you know it's not placebo? Have you had someone do a double-blind test on you?
No, and I usually mean skin irritants. Assuming that your gear is glass, use rubbing alcohol and salt and rinse with water.
Coffee is a stimulant. It makes your entire body work: your digestive system: have a seat; your nervous system: have a seizure; your emotional system: have a smile.
All the ones I know of use Lidocaine, which is a numbing agent and a local anesthetic. It does nothing but stop the pain signals at the nerve ends, it does not address the cause of the pain.
stability is relative. Nature is all for achieving the lowest possible energy state. The lowest possible energy state is O2 rather than isolated oxygen atoms. So, as long as you have oxygen gas, it is stable as O2. However, if copper is in the vicinity, oxygen will react with it and give off energy. The energy is now stored in the copper-oxygen compound rather than in the oxygen or copper atoms, and therefore the new compound is the lower energy state.
All water has a little dissolved gas. I’m quite sure that when water freezes, and expands by virtue of the arrangement of its molecules, this gas is expelled from solution and forms the bubbles.
but that reason is historical. As you know, there are several numbers which give the position of an electron, or the shell it belongs to. One of these numbers is the angular momentum, l, and it is this number that is of interest to us. At the beginning of spectroscopy, it was noticed that some series of spectral lines of alkali metals, those corresponding to the angular momentum values l = 0, l = 1, l = 2, l = 3 were sharp, principia, diffuse and fundamentally related to hydrogen lines, in that order.
It doesn’t exist. No truth serum. There are a lot of substances that can make you lose your inhibitions and talk (like alcohol), but there is nothing that would induce the same consistent or predictable increase in truthfulness.
Because the process is very different between the restaurant and the bottling company. The bottling company's process is mainly used for large-scale production, and it is often used to produce tens of thousands of liters of tea. The tea shop may only be able to produce 10 to 50 liters of tea. This process is very different, so the tea is naturally different.
The hand sanitizer is mostly alcohol, so it's inflammable like vodka. An electric spark can ignite inflammable things.
Big Tobacco actually paid for scenes like that to be put in movies to make smoking seem cool so they could sell more cigarettes. Thank You For Smoking is a great movie that covers a lot of this.
does the humidity of the air collect around the bottle? Yes. The bottle is much cooler than the air and the passing air, reaching the dew point, drops the water on its surface.
Concentration of stress. Picture a sheet of paper, you hold both ends evenly and pull it apart. Not hard enough to tear it, but it’s under tension. Hold it in front of you and pull it left and right. Let’s look at the middle of the paper, on a line going through the center, and this line is right between your hands as you pull the paper to the sides. On that line, at any point on the paper, the tension is about one pound per square inch. That’s not enough to tear it, but it’s a lot. Now imagine you snipped a small slit from the edge of the paper—a cut at the end of that line. Still didn’t tear. But what is happening to the paper at the slit? It’s being pulled apart, so obviously it’s no longer carrying that one pound per square inch. But the stress it would have experienced is transferred to the paper right where the cut ends. The more elastic our material, the more evenly this stress is spread out. Paper has little elasticity, so it’s highly concentrated right at the end of the cut, much more than that initial one pound per square inch. And so it’s easy to see why the paper tears right where the tension is highest. And the tearing continues, dragging that point of highest stress with it.
When you stick the tape to something, that thing is dirty and the dirt adheres to the tape, reducing the amount of tape there is left to stick to the next thing. The tape on the outside of the roll is clean, so there is nothing to stick to the sticky part.
Glass manufacturers put iron into their glass to make it easier to work with. When you look at glass from the front, the glass is so thin that the iron is hardly noticeable. But if you look at it from the side, the thickness is about ten times greater and so the iron stands out.
When someone starts a long-term drug, it usually takes a while to achieve what is called the therapeutic level, which is what you are talking about. You take 50 mg once a day, but your liver releases only 5 mg, and after 24 hours only 2,5 remain, and you need to have at least 35 to work, so you will not notice anything for a week.
They do not cause physical damage, but chemically affect certain vital functions. For example, nerve impulses use only small amounts of certain chemicals as a signal. There are countless numbers of them, but atoms and molecules are incredibly small. It takes huge numbers of them to make something large enough for us to see and interact with. For this I have to use the concept of the mole. It is based on Avagadro’s Number which is 6.022 x 1023, or 602,200,000,000,000,000. A mole of substance is the number of atoms or molecules in a certain quantity. So a mole of iron is a lump of iron that has 602,200,000,000,000,000,000 atoms. A mole of water is a drop that has 602,200,000,000,000,000,000 molecules. Fentanyl has a molar mass of 336.471 grams per mole. That means there are about 0.003 moles in a gram. So a gram of fentanyl has approximately 1,806 quintillion molecules. Not fentanyl in particular, but just suppose there is a chemical that attaches to the nerves and blocks the signal. If you take a mere 0.0003 grams of it, you’d have enough to block the action of 1,806 quintillion nerves in your body. That’s assuming that every molecule would go to a nerve and bind with it, which is highly unlikely. Just using numbers to illustrate the concept.
It is a sugary fluid spun out. The idea is to melt the sugar enough so that it flows through a small tube, coagulates and becomes a thin, flexible cord. To do this, a candy-maker rotates a heated cup with small holes on the outside, which are connected to the bottom of the cup. When the sugar melts, it passes through the holes, crosses the air and cools down, and collects on the outer rim of the cup.
Soap doesn’t need to be bubbly or foamy. Companies add bubbles because they think they make their products work better. Among the ingredients used to make soap bubble are sodium laureth sulfate (SLS), sodium lauryl sulfate (sometimes called sodium lauryl dodecyl sulfate, or SDS), and coco-glucoside.
This is only for the second shell; atoms have more than two shells. Each shell may contain up to 2n2 electrons, where n is the number of the shell. Hence a third shell may contain up to 18 and so on. The reason for this maximum is quantum mechanics. It seems that the quantum numbers describing a single atom only allow for four numbers, and when there are more than that number in a shell, two of the four numbers must be used to describe two different atoms, which is not possible.
Yes. A temperature is the average temperature of a collection of particles. In that eight-ounce cup of 40° Fahrenheit water, there are molecules which are 41°, 42°, and even lower. But the average is 40°. When the two eight-ounce cups are put together you get sixteen ounces at an average temperature of 60°. If the hot water were to take over and make the combined 16 ounces boil to 80°, that would violate the second law of thermodynamics. And where did the extra heat come from? If no heat enters the system, the total amount of heat must remain the same.
This phenomenon is called contrailing. When a plane flies at high altitude, water droplets that escape from the engine's exhaust mix with particulates from the engine exhaust and freeze when they meet the air. The crystals of this ice freeze into a long white streak. If you search on the Internet, you will no doubt find the conspiracy theories of chemtrails, that the aircraft drop chemtrails into the air to poison people, to keep the population in check, or what. That is nonsense.
Because it has fermented or spoiled in some way. Or it’s just some peculiar chemistry that only happens when left out for a long time.
That we don't know. There is a common working hypothesis that depression is caused by an imbalance of substances in the brain (neurotransmitters like dopamine, etc.) and that antidepressants help correct this imbalance. But a lot of evidence is against this - we have not renounced this hypothesis because our other explanations are even more inapplicable. A nobel prize is definitely waiting for the one who will solve it. But although we do not know how it works, we still use it because it helps many people. We only do not know why it helps some and not the other.
Alcohol and water combine; that is, alcohol actually dissolves in the water and forms covalent bonds with it. This solution has a much lower freezing point than pure water, and is really a new homogeneous solution.
No. It's good to think of chemicals as objects in the real world. Now imagine that you have two balls. You have tied them together with a rope. But between the balls there is a spring which is compressed and tries to pull them apart. The spring can't separate them because they're tied together, but it tries as hard as it can. Now imagine that an exothermic reaction cuts the rope. Then the spring can push them apart really hard and they can go in opposite directions. Now you have two balls moving and bumping into things. If you know what heat is, you will remember that it is the movement of small particles. So if our two balls are now small particles and they are moving around, we have just produced heat. I saw you asking about the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy in another post. It's analogous to the spring. While the balls are tied together, there is a lot of potential energy stored in the spring, and that energy cannot be released. But once you've provided the energy to break the bonds (cut the rope), the spring can push them apart and that is the same as converting the stored energy into kinetic energy. * *ATP is different, though. It is very important to release as little heat as possible, since heat will escape and you will lose the energy. Essentially, we use the energy of the cell's chemical reaction (the expansion of the spring) to shoot the ball (ATP) into a second spring. The second spring is compressed by the incoming ball, which makes the two balls stick together, just as the first balls were held together by the rope. The important thing is that since we used a hook to hold the balls together instead of a knot, we can get the balls apart again when we want to. That is essentially what ATP does. It compresses a spring system which is very easy to unlock when you want to release the energy.
Fireman speaking. Fire needs three things to exist. 1. Fuel 2. Oxygen 3. Heat. If you remove 1, fire can’t exist. Take a candle. Cover it. Oxygen is exhausted, candle goes out. This is why fireman don’t fight fire with fire. They fight fire with fuel. Stop giving it fuel, it will burn out by itself. Now for the common house fire. It’s too big to cut off the oxygen. It’s too big to knock the building down and remove the fuel. So the only way is to remove the heat. Water is excellent at removing heat. It’s also very cheap and readily available. Fire doesn’t really consume things as we think. Every material has a heat of ignitability. The heat of ignitability is the temperature at which the material gives off combustible vapours. These vapours are the ones that burn. These vapours are hot, the same temperature as the heat of ignitability. When you light a fire, it takes about a minute to reach the heat of ignitability. The flame from the lighter heats and dries out the material. When the material reaches this temperature, the vapours are ignited. This produces a chain reaction. That’s what smoke is. It’s just fuel that hasn’t burned. When smoke gets hot enough, it will burn. Water is thrown on the fire. Water is colder than the burning vapours. It cools the vapours and vaporizes. When the burning vapours are cooled below the heat of ignitability, the heat is removed. There’s no heat, fire goes out. Water is very cheap. It’s also infinitely available. It’s used for all sorts of things in the city. It’s so easy to get hold of, you just have to chuck another pipe into the water supply, put a cap on it, and you’ve got a fire hydrant. Using water in such quantities is also good for the environment. There are materials more effective than water at removing heat, but they’re usually expensive and not always practical. They might also require special equipment. Water can easily be directed into a hose and a nozzle. Foams and powders are great at putting out fires, but it’s not as easy and you can’t use them in such quantities. Water can react with the chemical on fire and start the reaction again. That’s why you have fire extinguishers of different types. To summarize: Water is good at removing heat, and plentiful and cheap enough to be used everywhere to put out fires by removing the heat. (NB. There are a lot of comments on this particular article.) Yes, this is the current theory on how fires behave. This is slightly above the ELI5 level, so I’ve kept it simple. The fire triangle is very easy to understand, explain and demonstrate. The chain reaction isn’t.
The reason is that you've opened the container. Get two jugs, one for a gallon, one for a pint, and they'll both be pretty much the same as long as you don't open them. The reason you open them is because it's opened to the air and the air carries bacteria. Milk is pasteurized in the factory to kill the bacteria and make it last longer.
The white part is at the bottom, near the outlet, and the two colors are mixed together right before they come out. If you cut it in half, it would be one color at the top and the other at the bottom.
Because distilling concentrates the alcohols in the final product. All fermentations produce a mixture of methanol (the bad alcohol) and ethyl alcohol (the good alcohol). In general, the amount of methanol in products of fermentation is small and is therefore not dangerous (wine and beer). Methanol also boils at a lower temperature than ethyl alcohol. Thus, in the first distillation, the initial distillate contains a high (and dangerous) concentration of methanol. This must be discarded to remove most of the methanol.
salt contains many additives to prevent caking. Sodium silicoaluminate is an anti-caking agent, it prevents salt from clumping... Dextrose apparently stabilizes iodine.
- Polonium was dissolved in the tea, he was also poisoned, but he suffered most of all, because he was the only one who drank tea. The poisoning from polonium does not go through the skin very much, because the particles are too heavy to get inside, but once they are inside, they tear everything apart. In general, the dust got everywhere, as dust usually does, and this is how they tracked down the poisoning.
Working for a large manufacturer in the quality department, I can assure you that the nutritional values on the packages are pretty accurate. However, there is a 20 percent tolerance of the real value. There are many different ways to test for fats, fats, vitamins, minerals, and so on. These values usually remain the same for each ingredient and are compiled in a large database that is easily accessible when it is necessary to determine the nutritional value for new products. The only things that contribute to the caloric value are fats, fats, and carbohydrates, which give nine, four, and four calories per gram, respectively, and then add up to the total caloric value in the product.
Sunlight evaporates only the water, leaving the salt behind. This is how water is distilled: by evaporating and distilling it and collecting the water and salt that remains behind.
Well, the salt is broken up into molecules smaller than the pores of the filter, so it passes through. If you had a filter with pores smaller than the molecule of salt, then the solution would not pass through.
The key difference between these three is the amount of fat. Butter has a very high fat content, about 80%, cream is somewhere between 30 and 50% (depending on the type) and milk a meager 3.5 (or less) percent. These fat contents in turn affect the consistency of the ganache and, in particular, whether it will be thick or thin and liquid. The traditional ganache recipe calls for 50-50 chocolate and cream, a nice silky texture with plenty of fat from the cream. Some people prefer a lower fat content and therefore use cream and milk together, resulting in a slightly less rich and less viscous texture. If you use milk exclusively, you may have to use less of it or use other tricks to prevent the ganache from being too thin. But a bit of butter added to milk will give it the same richness and silkiness as the cream. If you run out of cream or can’t find heavy cream, then a little melted butter will be a good substitute, allowing you to create a glossy and smooth texture. All of this is a matter of balancing the fat in the ganache with the fat in the chocolate.
Your body’s chemical reactions are fixed. It is impossible to introduce new chemical reactions. All medicines are either stimulants or suppressors of the chemical reactions. The side-effects occur because the medicines are chemically similar to the ones that they are supposed to suppress or to stimulate. And all these chemical reactions are interconnected. Whenever one reaction is suppressed or arouse, a domino effect begins, causing other reactions. Moreover, as the same chemicals play different roles in different parts of the body, administering the analogue of those chemicals may also have many different effects on different parts of the body. Here is a chart of the chemical reactions in your body.
A steroid is a molecule with 17 carbon atoms arranged in four rings. But by that definition, cholesterol is also a steroid (or a sterol). Steroid hormones are substances that activate specific nucleic acid receptors, such as the sexual hormones, such as testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone, which act on their specific respective nucleic acid receptors, and the corticosteroids, including mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. If you're taking a medicine that suppresses your immune system, it's a glucocorticoid. [45] Anabolic-androgenic steroids, which increase muscle mass, act on the same nucleic acid receptor as the sexual hormones.
It isn’t hard. All you need is either lots of time and space (for natural evaporation) or huge amounts of energy (for distillation) and a comparatively low yield.
Well, our body uses many, many other enzymes to process things, but you just don't hear so much about them. Our metabolism consists essentially of burning what we eat, and a whole arsenal of enzymes makes this happen at temperatures that don't kill us (by being catalysts of the reaction). The B12 vitamin is actually transformed into two other enzymes, Adenosylcobalamine and Methylcobalamine, but its purpose is not to be broken down in large quantities for energy, but rather to be a part of the breakdown process.
Glass is made of two elements, silicon and oxygen. To dissolve glass you’d need to split these two apart, and they’re as inseparable as a husband and wife. The relationship is very solid. But then along comes the home-wrecker, the acid, with its attractive ions, and these couples are attracted to the ions more than to their husband or wife. Hence they dissolve. The marriage of silicon and oxygen in glass is too strong for most acids to break. Except hydrofluoric acid. That’s the mansplainer of the acids. It’s hot. Edit: After much thought... I’m leaving the typos. Thanks for all the awards! I wasn’t expecting them!
When food is reheated, it draws moisture out of it. This is why it’s usually no big deal with very greasy or wet foods—they’re just going to end up a little more soggy than before because they’re losing the moisture and probably acquiring more from condensing inside the refrigerator.
It is not so. All that happens is a chemical reaction. There is nothing added to the battery when it is charged.
I've always been told that warm water raises the temperature of the meat to unhealthy temperatures for too long, while the inside remains frozen. Cold water will not heat the meat so quickly, but will still defrost it, without it being exposed to a range of temperatures at which bacteria multiply rapidly, etc. When you thaw meat with water, you do not want to cook the meat. Cold water is not really that cold. Cold water is cold, but not that cold, otherwise it would be ice. Have you ever come in from the cold and stuck your hand in the cold water, but thought it was warm water, because it was warmer than your hand? That's it. I'm not a food scientist, that's just what my grandmother taught me.
But secret recipes are rare unless they involve some ingredient that is not and cannot be produced by anyone else on the planet, otherwise everything can be reverse-engineered and deduced. But with that, you also run into questions like why should you spend so much time and energy trying to figure out the content of a food? And you will probably receive a cease and desist order if you are encroaching on someone else's intellectual property.
The brain has specific receptors for the drugs, which they bind to like a lock and key. The puzzle piece of Narcan also fits this lock and key, and so it binds to the receptors instead of the drugs.
This is a matter of understanding that we do not produce electricity like in our electrical generating stations, and that in our bodies there are no conductive wires carrying free mobile charges. In the body, ions are used, that is, charged atoms. There are many common substances which can act as ion sources, such as sugar. Salt, for example, breaks up into positive and negative ions when dissolved in water. Then special structures, the so-called ion pumps, can move one kind of ion through the membrane and leave the other. There are therefore a large number of positive ions on one side of the membrane and a large number of negative ions on the other side, and we have a difference of potentials (volts) between these two sides. Let the ions meet, the potential drops, we have an electric pulse, then the ion pumps can restore the potential. It is thus by the creation and collapse of ionic potentials that man and most animals use electric signals.
The “RI” in both of these stands for “reuptake inhibitor.” When two nerve endings transmit a signal, they both release serotonin and norepinephrine, which are picked up by the little hairs on the receiving nerve ending. This doesn’t happen immediately; first, the signal has to be picked up. And then, after the signal is gone, the serotonin and norepinephrine are taken back into the nerve cells and stored again. Sometimes, however, in people with depression, the signal isn’t passed on properly because there aren’t enough serotonin or norepinephrine in the space between the nerves, so the signal isn’t passed on well. SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, but SNRIs inhibit both serotonin and norepinephrine. So more serotonin or norepinephrine can accumulate in the space between the nerves, giving the signal more time to be passed on. This is how a psychiatrist once explained it to me a few years ago. But please don’t take what I’ve said as medical fact, and leave the real doctors to do their own research.
Because until the solvents have evaporated, the paint will be partially liquid and can easily be smudged, removed, or even washed away.
There are other substances that evaporate with water, making it difficult to separate them out. The wasting of water comes from wasting clean drinking water. It is difficult, expensive and not energy-efficient to clean water for human consumption. Once water is mixed with other substances or goes down the drain, it is no longer clean drinking water. It cannot be used for growing food, for animals, or for anything else.
I do not think it would do much good. There are plenty of water-purifiers which make use of charcoal to a certain extent, but generally the water passes through a large number of small grains of charcoal so that all the water can come in contact with it. Charcoal works by being exceedingly porous and rocky. Those minute particles of dirt which come in contact with its surface are absorbed and removed from the water. It is thus necessary that all the water come in contact with the charcoal’s surface. So it can be an effective means of removing many impurities from water, but stirring the water with a stick of charcoal would probably be the least effective way. I should think it would be better to grind the charcoal, place it in a coffee-sieve, and pour the water slowly through it.
Metallic hydrogen, which is a superconductor, would mean less fuel would be needed for a rocket and so more weight could be put into it. The metallic hydrogen would give a greater power-to-weight ratio.
Now the brain works with messages transmitted by neurotransmitters, and these neurotransmitters activate the so-called “receptors,” which in turn transmit the message (like a letter in a mailbox). We have receptors for all the neurotransmitters that our bodies produce. These messages via neurotransmitters and receptors are important for the functioning of the body. And the body likes normal functioning. When you take drugs, you activate these same receptors in a way that is exaggerated, really the peaks are so exaggerated, and the body does not like this, because it is not normal functioning. So our body is like: "Well, we need to make some changes to get back to normal. " Normally, you get this by removing the drug. But the body, when the drug is repeated, thinks: "Wow, removing the drug doesn't help, then we have to get rid of some of the receptors to get back to normal functioning." Then you get a letter in each of the five mailboxes every day, you think that's plenty. And then suddenly you get fifty letters in each box every day and you can hardly do anything because you get so many mail. Of course, the first thing you do is get rid of all the mailboxes! You no longer need five, it is too much for you to handle. So your body is like: "Okay, so I get rid of some of the mailboxes, because it is clear that we need less of them to get back to normal functioning." When you suddenly stop taking the drug, you have too few mailboxes and normal functioning is difficult for the body. (It's like, okay, now you get much less mail, because you only have one mailbox. Great! But now you no longer get that massive influx of letters that forced you to remove four of your five mailboxes, and you notice that you're missing out on four letters a day that you used to get and oh! those were actually pretty important.) It takes some time for the body to adapt again to normal functioning. While adjusting, the brain has too few of these receivers for normal functioning, and it causes the so-called withdrawals. The brain has made changes to deal with the exaggerated activity of certain receivers during drug use. When the drug is no longer in your system, these changes lead to withdrawal symptoms. When the brain is in normal functioning, the withdrawal symptoms disappear. (There are some differences for the different drugs. Alcohol and nicotine are strange in particular, but generally speaking, this is what happens.)
As there is no medical evidence that eight glasses a day is beneficial, it doesn't matter. Since caffeine is a diuretic, you will need more water to balance it. The best indicator of whether you're getting enough water is to listen to your body. Basically your urine should be pretty clear, light yellow, and a lot of it. You should urinate 6-7 times a day. Other symptoms of dehydration are headaches, dizziness, dry lips and skin, etc. There are many different factors that change how much water you need. You can set a goal, but especially if you drink caffeine, listen to your body.
I take it you mean tin, in fact, when a liquid freezes it expands. A can of soft drink only contains a certain quantity of liquid, so as it expands it gradually stretches the can, which eventually bursts.
Rice and pasta can contain bacteria whose spores survive cooking. If boiled rice or pasta is left out at a temperature of 12°–14°C for too long (more than four or five hours) it can become extremely dangerous to eat. At this temperature the heat-resistant toxins of the bacteria that produce spores may develop.
Gemstones are the finished product—the cakes. Gold is the flour. It's easier to combine things to create a new thing than to try and create an element. Thanks for the love, everybody! :) And for the rest of you, I appreciate that you take this so seriously. But I realize this isn't perfect! I said precious stones instead of just diamonds, but you're right to point that out. This example is meant to be taken in good faith, with hyperbolic examples for the sake of the medium. But both the short and long answers are good, and you should all keep on learning! Thanks, Reddit, for making this my most popular topic ever, and my first post with karma points!
Why do you know pee tastes salty?
There is a water vapor in the air. This vapor is in a state of readiness to condense into liquid water, when the air can no longer hold it. Now, since the cold beverage absorbs heat from the air, it cools down the air until it can no longer hold the water vapor.
You don’t just cook for health reasons; you also cook for taste and consistency changes. You can kill all the bacteria that are harmful to you at only 77°C or lower for a longer period of time. The only surviving microbes are the bacilli that are dormant, but don’t matter for foods eaten immediately, because they don’t have time to wake up and multiply. But at 77°C the meat has not even reached boiling point yet, and at higher temperatures various other chemical reactions occur. To seal or brown the meat, or to caramelize the sugars, you need to heat it to 140°C.
You know, the fact that it evaporates quickly, but that’s not why it’s flammable, that’s why it’s easy to light on fire, which isn’t quite the same thing. Here’s another flammable substance: magnesium. The melting point of magnesium is somewhere around 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. But it’s not easy to light on fire, you need to heat it for ten seconds, maybe more, in an open flame, because it’s not volatile at all. If you could grind up magnesium into a fine powder and throw it into the air, then try to light it, it would probably go up easily and be extremely dangerous, but don’t try it. It’s unbelievably hot and terribly bright. What makes Rubbing Alcohol flammable is the reaction it has with oxygen. To explain that, I’m not going to use Rubbing Alcohol, which is isopropyl alcohol, but rather a simpler alcohol, ethyl alcohol. When you burn ethyl alcohol, you make it react with a special kind of oxygen. That “special kind” of oxygen is like ordinary oxygen, only it’s extremely reactive. That special kind of oxygen is created everywhere oxygen is found, but the more you heat something, the more of this special kind of oxygen you’ll get. There’s more of this special kind of oxygen in hot air than in cold. Now, here’s the chemical reaction: C2H6O + 3O2  2 CO2 + 3H2O. So, when you burn alcohol with oxygen, you’re actually creating carbon dioxide and water. And that creates heat. It creates heat because CO2 and H2O are more stable than alcohol and that special kind of oxygen. That’s a little complicated, but you just need to know that it creates a lot of heat. Basically, alcohol is flammable because, when you heat it up, it reacts with oxygen, creating heat, which in turn creates more of that special kind of oxygen, which creates more heat, and so on and so forth. Also, there’s a reason it doesn’t get as hot as it does in the beginning, but after a few seconds it settles down, but that’s also complicated. And lastly, you can use something besides oxygen to burn something else, but it’s also complicated.
There is no such thing as an original flame. The fire is the product of a continuous chemical reaction, therefore the flame is always new, even when the candles are burning together.
Water vapor is satisfied below boiling-point. But boiling-point is a special case, because at lower temperatures water occupies some of the air, but at boiling-point it wants to occupy more than all the air. Since it cannot occupy more than all the air, it becomes a gas until it has exhausted the heat, or until it has run out of water. For a more detailed explanation, search the subreddit, as this is a question that is asked often.
The thing about radiation is that, apart from the most extreme cases, it doesn't do anything immediately where it's easy to see the cause and effect. Such extreme cases don't occur in nature, they have to be manufactured. Even in our modern times, only 31 people died directly from Chernobyl, the rest of the effects were in the long-term increase in the rates of certain cancers, and we could only conclude that from statistics and huge samples.
It's called a hydrogen fuel cell. One of the problems is that hydrogen is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, which makes it difficult to store it in a tank. You would need a very high pressure, a very low temperature or a stablizer to hold a large amount in a tank. Unlike gasoline, which can easily be poured into a tank or into a can, hydrogen is a bit more difficult to transport. And a hydrogen tank leaking can lead to a far more violent explosion than a gasoline tank, which just bursts. And then you still have to produce the electricity to make the hydrogen, and that is often done with fossil fuels.
Like other constants having units, it is a measure of the magnitude of the units used. In this case, it is a product of two constants: the Avogadro constant which gives the number of molecules per mole. If the mole was larger or smaller in number, this constant would change, and so would the gas constant. The Boltzmann constant is a measure of the relationship between temperature and energy. More precisely, it gives the average increase in the kinetic energy of each molecule of a gas when the temperature rises by one degree Kelvin. If temperature and energy units were changed, the value of the Boltzmann constant would change, and so would the value of the gas constant. Since the Boltzmann constant is multiplied by the number of molecules per mole, the gas constant is the energy increase per degree of temperature rise for a mole of ideal gas. Or, stated differently, it gives the temperature-energy relationship of a mole of ideal gas at a given temperature, expressed in the units used. Usually, the units are expressed in joule per kilocalorie per mole. In other words, it is a conversion factor between macroscale moles and temperatures and microscale numbers of particles and energy per particle. (We changed the word Boltzmann to Boltzman because it is difficult to spell.)
It wouldn’t explode. It would burst and burn, yes, but it wouldn’t explode. For an explosion, the fuel has to be mixed thoroughly with oxygen, so that everything can burn at once. In your case, only the surface would be exposed to the air.
- Well, the vitamins B are completely unrelated substances. They were all grouped together in the beginning, because they were all discovered at once, and only later did we realize that it was a combination of different substances. There are gaps in the list as well, because we later discovered that some of them weren’t really vitamins at all.
The cold burns because it damages the body physically and kills cells. If you touch a piece of hot metal, the heat enters your hand and starts destroying and killing cells, and this causes the pain-receptors to start working. If you touch an ice cube and your hand or finger feels numb, the ice cube isn't actually hurting you, but merely cooling you down. That's why your nerves don't function as well, and you feel less pain or numbness. But if you touch something really cold, like liquid nitrogen, it is actually so cold that it freezes your cells immediately. And it is this process that causes the pain-receptors to start working.
The yellowing is caused by the residue of dust and perspiration which does not get washed out in the washing water. You must use a stronger agent. That is why the bleaching companies are in the business.
It's not air, it's just steam. When water boils, it changes from liquid water to gas water, but still water. Some of the bubbles may come from dissolved gases coming out as the water warms (because warm water cannot hold as much dissolved gas as cold water), but the big bubbles of boiling water are all steam.
This requires a lot of energy. For oil, the main cost of energy is the energy that microorganisms got from the sun.
- Charcoal is not burnt; it is pyrolised, which is a different process. Plants are mostly made up of cellulose and (for trees) lignin, which are complex substances that contain a lot of carbon. This carbon reacts with oxygen in the air and mainly gives off carbon dioxide and water, which are both gases at the temperature of the flame, and therefore evaporate in the air. (In practice, the flame is usually a little 'dirty' and consists of a number of other things.) This reaction consists of two parts: the first of which is the breakup of existing molecules, which costs energy, and the second which is the recombination of the separated molecules with oxygen, which gives off more energy than was spent on the first step, and both steps together thus give out energy. In the case of charcoal, the wood or other organic matter is heated, but is not given enough oxygen for a flame to develop (for example, because it is placed underground in a heap with a little oxygen). This heating causes the first step of the reaction, in which the complex organic molecules are broken up into mainly free carbon and other things. But as there is no sufficient oxygen for the second step, the reaction stops here. (In practice, some oxygen is introduced, just enough to start the second step, which causes the organic matter to continue to decompose at a sufficient temperature.) This first step only is called pyrolysis (Greek pyro = fire and lysis = decomposition). The result is charcoal, which is almost pure carbon and burns better because many impurities have been removed (especially water, which takes a lot of energy to evaporate), and because no energy was used in the first step.
Imagine a substance so sweet (much sweeter than sugar) that one calorie’s worth is enough to sweeten an entire bottle of Diet Coke. Imagine using that substance to sweeten your drink.
Dry shampoo is a spray powder that absorbs excess grease from your hair. It often has perfume added to it, which makes your hair smell good. It does not clean the hair or wash out dirt like regular shampoo.
Methyl salicylate absorbs the energy of the excited nitrogen and reradiates it in blue light. It's called fluorescence. Sugar crystals also produce a dim glow in this way. They are called tribo-luminescent.
Quantum mechanics says that the electrons of the atoms can exist only at certain specified energy levels. These energy levels are different for each atom and are also different between atoms and molecules. When light hits an atom, it absorbs it and goes to a higher energy level. Then it is free to give out light, but this light, because of the law of quanta, can only have a certain energy, and this energy is determined by the color. By knowing the color of the light, one can determine the atom which gave the light. The spectral lines are read by comparing them with the spectral lines given out by known atoms.
A meat will be tough if it has a lot of connective tissue, which is mostly composed of collagen. Cooking the meat for a long time turns the collagen into gelatin, which gives it the savory flavor. That flavor is bestowed on certain foods because they contain glutamate, a sapid substance found in the human body, which gives them a savory taste. * * * Various food ingredients are rich in glutamic acid, including meats, shellfish, fish sauce, canned fish, canned fish, dried bonito, sardines, and anchovies, as well as tomatoes, mushrooms, dried yeast, meat extract, and soy sauce. * * * If MSG can be considered a vegan ingredient, you can use it.
It’s called sludge or biosolids. It’s basically separated and dried out, then used as fertilizer, I think. (For EPA information:
A powder cocaine is dissolved in water, and is absorbed through the mucous membranes (gums, nose, etc.). Crack cocaine is a cheaper, easier way of making a freebase, that is, making chemical changes to make it possible to liquefy the cocaine into a gas, which can be inhaled. When cocaine is used in this way, it enters the bloodstream much more quickly, which makes it possible to use relatively little cocaine to get a very intense and quick high.
mole is a number, like the number twelve. It comes from the need of chemists to be able to relate the number of atoms to something tangible. A mole is the number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon, which is 6.022 times 1023. So, if you know the mass of your atoms, you can calculate the number of atoms in your sample. It is convenient to go from the “number of atoms” to the “mass of your sample” by means of a quantity called molar mass, which is a number associated with each atom which tells us how many grams it would weigh in a mole.
Neither soap nor detergent breaks down oil; they simply emulsify it and suspend it. It’s still oil, only now it’s suspended in water instead of floating on top.
It’s the opposite for me. A good beer tastes better when I eat a Döner. Perhaps there are certain compounds in the food that trick your tongue into thinking it’s tasting something else. Then you’ll taste less of the beer’s flavour and more of its alcohol.
Gas is chemical energy that gets released as heat when it burns. An internal-combustion engine changes the heat into pressure and that pressure into motion. It does this by burning the gas in the cylinders. This drives the pistons, which turn the crankshaft. And through a series of gears, this turns the wheels of the car and powers its electrical systems.
It reduces the surface tension of water because it contains surfactants, such as alcohol ethoxylate. Water, under normal conditions, likes to clump together and stick to each other. But that would not be a problem if your dishwasher water was pure; it contains dissolved solids, such as minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, and other substances. These dissolved solids are left behind when the water evaporates and your dishes are left with water spots. Dishwasher rinse aid breaks the surface tension so that the water does not stick and, on the contrary, runs off your dishes without leaving a mineral residue.
- The scale of Celsius was first developed, and set 0 as the freezing point of water and 100 as the boiling point. These are remembrance-worthy, measurable temperatures. Later it was discovered that absolute zero is 273.14°C. At some point it was said: "Isn't it better to count up from zero than down from zero? " So a scale was made that started from zero, but what should the scale be? Why not make the degrees the same as the degrees on the Celsius scale, which is already known by all? That is very simple. So we have two scales with equal temperatures, but different starting points.
Common usage defines flammable as “will burn easily when combined with oxygen and subjected to sufficient heat.” Oxygen is not flammable, because it does not burn... in the presence of itself. It is not flammable, but it makes everything flammable.
They begin to absorb air particles, dust, bacteria, and foul smell. This makes them lose their freshness.
yes, the mass of the products and reactants, and the number of each atom involved in the reaction—so long as we're not talking radioactivity. So if we start with a mole of one particular atom, we'll end up with a mole of that atom (whether it's reacted or not).
When a woman gets pregnant, her body starts producing lots of hormones that are needed for the fetus to develop and grow. Some of these hormones accumulate in the woman's urine a few days or weeks after conception. This causes a double chemical reaction in the test, which is why it has two bands. The first reaction basically just detects water, this is the first "not pregnant" line. The second band contains a chemical that only turns color when it reacts with the hormones, but this reaction takes longer. Think of it this way: in urine there is a lot of water, so it is easy to detect, but there is hardly any hormones, so they are harder to detect. So you always get the first line, if you don't get it, it means the test is broken. The second band takes longer to appear, because this is the part that actually "does something."
Just like if we keep a pot filled with water in the shade. The water on the surface takes the heat from the sun and evaporates, leaving behind the water which remains cool.
Because acetone evaporates easily. When volatile liquids change to gas they take a little heat from the environment. So, when you touch acetone a little evaporates stealing heat from your finger.
Water is a rather unique molecule. It is unusual because the water molecule is extremely polar, the hydrogen atoms in its bonding have much more strongly attracted to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen atoms, and this gives oxygen a partial negative charge and hydrogen a partial positive charge. The water molecule is then able to form very strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules. This hydrogen bonding makes the ice crystal very unusually open for a solid, and the liquid water very unusually dense for such a light compound. Combining both of these makes water slightly denser than ice, unlike almost all other known solids. * Water is also unusual in other ways. * * * * It is liquid at room temperature, unlike almost all other light molecules, because the hydrogen bonds make the molecules stick together. Compare CO2 (which is gas at room temperature) or ethanal (boiling point 76°C), which are both much heavier molecules. * * * * * * It has very high surface tension, again because of the strong attraction between water molecules.
LiPO batteries have problems at temperatures below 50° Fahrenheit (10° C). There is a balance between tolerance to temperature, number of recharges, energy storage capacity, etc. Every chemistry has its advantages and disadvantages.
It is best to spray the cleaning product directly on the surface to be cleaned. The cleaning implement is absorbent, and it is impossible to make sure that all the cleaning product will get to the dirty surface. That amount of cleaning product is therefore wasted.
There are hundreds of kinds of cells in the body, many of which only occur in a certain tissue. Each cell has certain projections (receptors) on its surface, which are sensitive to certain hormones, and these differences in the receptors vary from one tissue to another. For example, a drug that acts on the kidneys (for example) has in part the key to a certain receptor that only the kidneys have, in other words, it disguises itself as a hormone that the kidneys are waiting for and only the kidney cells let it in and let it do its job. Disclamer: I'm not a biologist.
The makers take the natural substance from which the flavor is derived, and pass it through a special mass spectrometer. It will tell them what substances it contains and how many molecules of each there are. With this knowledge they can find another source of the substances and make them up into the same formula as before. It's like making a recipe for cooking food. It's all a matter of putting the right materials together in the right proportions.
I don’t understand. What was the sequence of steps in your experiment?
Sometimes the coating protects what’s inside until it reaches your stomach, liver, etc. I know you shouldn’t chew serotonin, because if it gets stuck in your throat and starts to dissolve, it can do a lot of damage.
It’s cyanoacrylate which is an acrylic monomer. When it comes in contact with air, it actually reacts with water molecules which causes it to form a strong, tight bond between two objects.
Space-time, space-time, Einstein's theory of special relativity must take space and time as a single thing. Therefore, if you stretch or bend space, you are also affecting time. For a more detailed explanation of how this “might” work, it's too complex for Reddit.
You can see the stars if it is fairly dark around you. If you want to see them properly, you need it to be fairly dark in the distance as well. We who live a little outside the city know this already: when you look at the horizon you can see a city is a long way off, because even twenty miles away the night sky is fairly light because of all the lights from the city. And this light, which can be seen from quite a distance from the city, that light also takes up a lot of space in the city. This comes from light sources that aren’t aimed properly, from street lights with badly adjusted reflectors. Lights in people’s windows that light up more space than the room, car headlights and so on. * Some lights are deliberately directed into the dark, like the air navigation lights for planes. But those aren’t a big problem compared to all the unnecessary city lights. The whole thing even has a name: light pollution. Light pollution makes it difficult, or even impossible, to make out the stars in the night sky. Or to see, for example, the Milky Way as a sort of cloud between many bright stars. That’s one of the many reasons why astronomers prefer to set up their telescopes on the desert plateaus of places with few inhabitants. (There are more reasons, but this helps to make the idea clearer.)
Cannon is just a fiction. The real thing inside the cannon is a big piston. When the person gets into the cannon he is standing on top of it. When it fires, it only pushes the person up quickly enough to hit the net or whatever it's aimed at, which is not very far away. With a little smoke and noise you have a cannon shooting a person. It would be like you standing on the middle of a seesaw, and fat Kevin jumps from the top of the playground into the other end, sending you flying to a broken leg and a disappointed parent.
The ground is big, so it’s usually quite safe to assume that no matter what we do on the surface, we can’t pump enough electrons into or out of the ground to alter the balance between protons and electrons, so the electric potential of the ground is always zero. Q: Does everything have this special ability? A: everything has it —a little or a lot? The special ability is being big.
Two main things happen inside a star like our sun, and they are in opposition. It’s actually a very delicate balance. At the center, hydrogen fuses to helium with incredible speed. That creates immense pressure and heat, and that in turn causes the center to expand—just as water boils in a kettle and tries to expand and escape as steam. But a star is very, very large, and although hydrogen is light, it is still in enough quantity in the outer parts of the sun for gravity to try to compress it all together. That is the delicate balance. The center is trying to expand, the outer parts to contract. For most of its life, a star like our sun can maintain this balance and appear to shine constantly. But what happens if the constituent elements change? As I said before, the star shines because hydrogen atoms fuse into helium atoms. There is enough hydrogen in the center to allow this to continue for a very long time, billions of years, but eventually the hydrogen will be gone and so will the fuel. And your original thought, that since the star no longer has any fuel, it must collapse, is actually quite correct. Initially the sun will contract as its hydrogen atoms are used up, but as it contracts, the pressure at the center increases (because there are more and more atoms there) and as the pressure increases, the temperature rises. And it will get so hot that a new fusion reaction takes place, this time converting helium to carbon and oxygen. And there are a lot of helium atoms in the center, because the sun has taken a long time to convert the hydrogen to helium—some 12 billion years. With the new, more powerful fusion reaction taking place at the center, the pressure outward will be enough to counteract the force of gravity trying to pull the star together, and because the helium reaction releases more energy, the outer layers of the star will expand. And because of this greater pressure, the star will become much larger than it is now. And as it expands, the temperature of its outer parts will fall, and its color will change from yellow-white to orange-red. Our sun will have turned into a red giant (and raised the temperature of our earth to well beyond what any living thing could stand).
These units are a bit complicated, but 8.4 microsieverts per hour is not so alarming for a short time. You don't want to sit there for a long time, but neither do you have to worry about a longer stay. Your normal radiation dose for life on Earth is about 3 millisieverts, which is 3,000,000 microsieverts. It takes a little over two weeks to get a year's dose in this area, so a short visit to pretend you are doing it bravely doesn't mean much radiation. Anyway, units. There are two things to measure in radiation, exposure and dose. Exposure is how much radiation you absorb. It is measured in grays and 1 gray is 1 joule of radiation per kilogram. That is a lot of radiation and if you get it all at once, it would probably give you a severe case of radiation poisoning, but you would probably survive. To make things a bit more manageable, we use milli- and micrograys. That's not quite right either, because different radiations affect you differently. For example, 1 gray of neutrons is about 2 to 10 times more harmful to your cells than 1 gray of gamma rays. The sievert is the gray times the multiplication factor. That means that 1 gray of gamma rays is 1 sievert and 1 gray of neutrons is 2 to 10 sieverts.
JWT is a very sensitive infrared telescope, so any source of heat will interfere with measurements. Including the earth and the moon. So JWT is in the Lagrange point. The Lagrange point always has the major heat sources (the sun, the earth and the moon) all on one side of the telescope. On this side, the interference shield can be built to avoid interference.
The water is boiling because the temperature has been raised to the point where some of it changes into gas, pushing the rest of it aside and rising in bubbles to escape as steam. When you heat water from the bottom up, the water at the bottom gets hot enough to boil first, the steam is boiled and rises into the relatively cool water, which is still boiling. The steam cools and loses energy until it can no longer hold the water apart as a bubble, and the bubble suddenly collapses, breaking under the water pressure. That is the loud sound you hear, and it goes away once the water is heated throughout and the bubbles can pass through it to escape as steam, with a much quieter explosion at the surface. If you stir the pot of boiling water vigorously as it is heating up, you can get rid of this loud stage of boiling.
On the contrary, moving vehicle creates many dynamic forces in addition to the static force of its weight, and therefore the damage is greater the faster. There are speed limits for trucks on bridges for this reason. It may be that even a heavy-duty vehicle license plate has a special speed for the bridge. In extreme cases, a very heavy truck is crawling on a closed bridge, at the walking speed, to reduce the burden on the bridge.
Sand does move a little. But sand is very small. Even the ocean, which is much less flexible than sand, is deflected by a few meters in a thousand meters deep ocean. Such deflection would not be noticeable on a grain of sand. But the land also bends with the tides. But this is not visible on the level of a grain of sand (it is also not noticeable in buildings because they bend the same way, moving with their foundations). The ground rises and falls by about a foot every day, which is not as much as the ocean because the ground is more solid than water. But on this scale, the rock is also a thick liquid and it behaves as such in the tides.
The salt makes it harder for the water molecules to change into a gas, so it has to be hotter for that to happen.
If the something you are referring to is the whole universe, the best answer we can give you is that if there were nothing we could not observe it. This is the anthropomorphic principle. Q: How do we know there is something rather than nothing? A: To ask why seems more like metaphysics or philosophy than physics.
Intertia is the power of a body to keep the speed it has. Intertia is a numerical value. It is a force which quickens or slows it down. It is the mass multiplied by the speed. A force which is applied in the direction it is applied in gradually gives a momentum to the body, and to stop the body the same force is necessary in the opposite direction.
You have the strength to overcome the pull of gravity. You do it every day, every time you get up or climb a hill. You can’t pull yourself up by your bootstraps because what you pull on counteracts what you’re pulling with, because you’re tied to yourself. You’re pulling with your arms, and your bootstraps are pulling with an equal and opposite force. The net force acting on your whole body is always zero, no matter how hard you pull.
The procedure varies with the gas in question. But nitrogen and oxygen are the ones most easily obtained from the air. When air is cooled in a vessel, the first liquid that condenses is nitrogen. You pour it into a tank, then heat it up to gas, and then send it out to a nitrogen-tank customer. Oxygen condenses next, and the procedure is the same. Argon is also obtained from air. But CO2 is made by a chemical process in which hydrogen and air are combined.
moisture can condense in a container even after it has been emptied.
The danger of MRIs with metals is all about magnetism. Your wedding ring is probably not made of a magnetic material, such as gold, silver, or platinum.
Gravity is expressed in acceleration. As long as you are accelerating, your body experiences weight. As soon as your speed and that of your spaceship no longer increase but remain constant, you experience the illusion of weightlessness. Also, deceleration gives the same effect as gravity. This is why you are pulled back into your seat by the seat belt when you are braking.
The temperature that we feel, the one that we can perceive, is only the rate at which heat enters or leaves our skin. If we touch something hard, it can feel “colder” because it is more efficient in removing heat from our skin than carpeting.
It does not reflect all the light, and so if you look at it for a long time, you can see the silvery surface behind the reflection. If you look at it at an angle, it is even more noticeable, since there is less light outside to reflect. As a matter of fact, it is just like a less reflective surface like a glass pane or a car with polished paint. There, though, so much light is absorbed that you have to look directly at the glass or at the car in good light to see any reflection. And even then, it is a smoky reflection that does not hide what is behind the glass or the color of the car.
The weak force is not manifest in everyday life as is the case with electricity and gravity. So we cannot rely on this to give us an intuition. If we want to understand what the weak force “does,” we should examine the initial and final conditions before and after the process of a weak force mediated particle collision, and we must make a thorough study of the present and past situation, including the properties of the particles, their energy, their momentum, etc. This gives us a beginning of an intuition about the effect of charged and accelerated weak force collisions: we have a knowledge of the energy of the initial particles and the momentum and the energy of the final particles, which we have reason to know will appear in the form of some new particles. Leaving the interaction point with a different momentum. As you mentioned, the most interesting consequence of accelerated charged and accelerated weak force collisions is that they are the only natural force that can convert one kind of quark into another (for instance, enabling fusion reactions in our sun).
rocket engines produce a lot of thrust. For example, the Falcon Heavy is capable of delivering up to 215,100 kilograms of thrust during takeoff.
When a car is moving at a fixed speed, it experiences no force other than gravity and the normal force of the earth (I’m ignoring air here because this is physics 101 and air doesn’t exist.) So a car moving at 40 mph experiences the same force as a car moving at 60 mph—namely, zero. When you’re hit by a car, you go from zero to the speed of the car in a fraction of a second, so the force on your body is tremendous. But the car is slowing down a little, because the force is equal in both directions.
Yes. In general, it is dangerous to be near a thunder in the water. Water is a good conductor of electricity, and so there will be considerable current flowing and emancipating the fishes. If it were not true, the electric eels could not have discovered it.
It is because in order to bounce, it must have the capacity to absorb the entire impact energy by elastic deformation. If you slightly bend a spring, you will see it springing back to its original shape when you let go of it. This is the elastic deformation – it is changing shape for a while and then springs back to its original shape. But if you bend it much, it will not return to its original shape. This is called the plastic deformation. In this deformation, the energy that goes into deformation is converted into heat. In elastic deformation, it is converted into mechanical energy. The elastic deformation varies with the material and the nature of the impact. For example, a steel ball may bounce on a concrete floor if it is thrown with light force. But if it is thrown with heavy force, it will not bounce much and it will leave a dent on the ball or the floor. It must be remembered that both the ball and the floor will be deformed. A carpet deforms more by plastic deformation, and so the ball does not bounce much on it. The interesting thing about carpets is that the friction involved in their movement helps the ball to bounce. The carpet fibres are rubbing against each other, so that the impact is not elastic.
I'm looking for a method that will tell us more than the red shift in light. It will also tell us about time itself. If we reverse the order of things, the whole would come back to the point where everything was once again in a single place. There are many assumptions in this process, but different methods yield more or less the same result.
Yes. Ice cream melts slower when the temperature around it is closer to the temperature of the ice cream.
The smallest black holes are the stellar-mass black holes in the center of a galaxy. But the formation of the largest black holes is still a mystery. These are far more massive than the stars, and some of them have grown larger than thirteen billion years of vacuum accumulation could produce.
Your air-conditioner produces air at about 35° to 45° F, which you feel when it combines with the air in your room, to maintain the desired temperature. In the opposite direction, when your heat pump is heated to 72° F, your heater is producing air at 110° to 170° F, and you are feeling it circulating in your room, as it mixes with the room air to maintain the temperature you want. Outside, the air is heated or cooled more or less evenly over a given area.
You have only to drop a pebble into a quiet pond and see what happens to the ripples as they pass on. The same thing happens with sound. You hear it first as the ripples pass over you, then you no longer hear it at all. Then, if you are close enough to the shore, you may hear it again as the ripples pass over you again—it is the echo. But at last the ripples are so far apart that you no longer see them (or hear them, in the case of sound). If there is a slight breeze, the water is ruffled, and this is why we hear less well if the leaves are waving in the wind.
The color of an object is the color of the light it reflects. If an object is white, it reflects all the colors. If an object is red, it reflects only the red color. If it is black or any other dark color, it absorbs almost all the colors and reflects very little. That's why black things get hotter than white things in the sun. When white things are black, they reflect the light, and black things absorb the light, and absorbed light turns into heat.
It is an atom bomb because it is powered by the splitting of atoms. Only certain kinds of atoms can split and release their energy, and at the same time split and release their energy when they come into contact with atoms of a similar kind. They are called fissile atoms, and only fissile atoms can be used in atom bombs.
: Why should you not? Why is it not possible? Because the car would get wrecked, either by a slide or by a roll. The car has a lot of momentum, and if you want the tires to change direction too much and too quickly, they cannot do it. Secondly, why can't you do it? Well, you can, but it's harder. And it's harder because the cars are designed that way. And this is the short history of power steering: in the beginning, there was no power steering. The steering wheel was directly connected to the tires, and steering was really difficult. To turn the wheels at low speed when you wanted them to turn a lot, it was really hard. You needed a lot of strength. Then power steering was invented, and now when you turned the steering wheel, the car sped up and assisted you. It was much easier to drive than before, especially when you wanted to turn the tires a lot. However, there was a problem at high speed. It was so easy to turn that when you only wanted to turn a little, like at high speed, the steering wheel jumped around: there was no control. So they made it a power steering with speed adaptation (or various other names for the same thing). They made it so that at low speed it helped you turn the wheel a lot, so you could drive easily, and at high speed it hardly helped, so you could drive comfortably and so you wouldn't turn too far by accident.
What kills you is the energy, which is volt x amp. Volt is like the pressure between two points, the potential difference. And amp is like a flowing liquid, the flow of energy. Now, when n volts are being claimed for the current, half of them are lies and the other half don’t have enough energy to hurt you.
Electomagnetism is the force of the movement of the electron. Electomagnetism is carried by the particles of light. The visible light is only one form of the light waves. If I move an electron, its force field propagates in the form of a wave. Like when you thump on the water, and the pressure waves move through the water. The wood does not move, but the force field carries the force. Electomagnetism does not need a medium.
In a real world, air resistance slows you down, the faster you go, the more fuel you need to maintain your speed, because you must use more energy to accelerate up to the point where you can overcome air resistance.
You’re hot. And when the air’s still around you, you heat that air and stay inside your own warm bubble. So wind blows that bubble away and replaces it with room-temperature air, which you now have to warm up again (which robs you of heat). Similarly, when you want to cool down hot food, you can blow on it and replace the warm air on top of it with room-temperature air, and that’ll cool the food.
According to our current understanding of physics, there is no hard limit. However, the expansion is not so great that it can pull apart the objects held together by gravity or other forces, so that as long as some structures exist, they will be able to withstand the expansion of space. However, the structures are not eternal as we understand them today, and it is very likely that in the far, far future, the universe will consist of isolated particles, especially photons, which are so far from each other that they cannot be observed by anyone. How can it stretch? The expansion was innumerable billions after the Big Bang, so we are already in a very, very stretched universe.
You are describing a hidden variable theory. But it is known that no hidden variable theory where the hiddenness is local (in other words, local in the sense that it is a property of the particles themselves which cannot be transmitted faster than light) can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics. The only way to get this to work is to assume that the particles communicate faster than light or that there is some kind of base level to which all particles have access no matter where they are (which is in essence the same).
The crystals are the spatial representations of a certain shape. The symmetry of the pattern is repeated in the crystals and the molecules. Time is the same as space, so if you scale it up from three dimensions to four by adding time, you have a regular symmetry over time. So this is a time crystal. It's interesting how to use it. We cannot extract energy from it without violating the first law of thermodynamics (if a change in time, which a pattern is, can be utilized and harnessed, without requiring some energy, the rule that energy cannot be created or destroyed is going to be a problem), so the application is unknown.
It has to do with the difference between the speed at which the object spins and the speed at which your eyes (or the screen) can refresh. If they are the same, the object may look like it’s not spinning. If the object is spinning slightly slower than the refresh rate of your eyes, it may look like it’s spinning backwards. The fan seen on a small-screen TV. Let’s say you have an old TV, one that refreshes only once a second. If the fan spins at the same speed, its blades will always be in the same position every time the TV takes a picture. They will spin all the way around between refreshes. But if the speed of the fan blades is a little slower, say 0.90 rpm slower, the fan will only make one full turn between refreshes. Since the fan will only have completed 90 percent of a full turn in the time between refreshes, when you compare the two images, it may appear that the fan has spun ten percent backwards.
It depends on how they were killed. If they were blown to bits, the arrow would probably go with them. If they were run over by a speeding car, even if they were shot dead while holding the arrow, it would probably fly in some other direction. I don’t know. It’s possible it would miss or not even be fired.
I think wind is caused by the difference in heat on the ground. The heat rises, the cold falls. And the difference in the way these two forces act upon each other, builds up the energy, which is dispersed by the wind.
The air is flowing into the ear canal and is held there by the eardrum. This creates a high-pressure bubble which the incoming air must circumvent, and this decreases the amount of air hitting the eardrum.
Watts are only the product of volts and amps. Watts are the unit of "power," how much total energy is flowing through the circuit in one second.
Our two eyes are a few centimeters apart, and when our brain calculates the 3D shape of the object from the difference between the two 2D images, it does so by comparing the differences. At a great distance, the differences become so insignificant that we have the same 2D image twice, and thus there is no 3D shape to calculate.
A huge block of metal under your hood, generating a lot of heat. Your car's "heater" is nothing more than an ingenious way of harnessing this engine heat and using fans, dampers, etc. to control the amount of hot air getting into the car. As for the windows, they are gradually heated, and the glass is super-strong, tempered, laminated glass, designed to withstand sudden temperature changes, impacts, etc.
No. A bumrush means speeding up, not slowing down. Huh? If you're asking if it's possible to use friction to slow down a fall, well, yes, that's what you do if you grab on to something to stop your fall.
Power is equal to torque times r.p.m. At low speeds, most of the power is used up in keeping the engine running. At mid-range speeds, the engine produces more power, but the friction losses haven't really increased, so the engine starts to work more efficiently and so makes more. At high speeds, it becomes harder and harder to get enough air and fuel into the engine, so the crankshaft speed drops.
You're only partly right. Those times are true, but only for those circumstances. It's possible to boil water in less than 3 mins, and to freeze it in less than hours. It all depends on how much water, and how quickly or slowly. Energy can be added to water, or taken away from it, and both of these processes can be carried out in different ways.
Current (amperes, I) is the number of charge particles moving. The more they pass through your body (and especially your heart), the worse it is. Voltage (V) is the amount of force trying to move the particles. It's determined by the source of electricity (a nine-volt battery, for example). There is a fundamental relationship between current (I) and voltage (V): Ohm's law. V = IR The "R" is resistance, the impedance to the flow of charge particles, the greater the higher. Ohm's law states that a higher resistance (poor conductors) require a higher force to move charge particles through them. So a given force (voltage) will move fewer charge particles (current) through a poor conductor (high resistance) than a good conductor (low resistance). Your body, especially your skin, has very high resistance (when it's dry). This means that the current at a given voltage is quite low and therefore can't do much damage. But if you change the resistance suddenly by nicking your skin or getting it wet, the same voltage will now give you a much higher current that can kill you. By the way, there is something called micro-shock, which is a small current passing through the heart directly and stopping it. This usually happens only in surgery where the heart muscle is directly exposed to the source of electricity.
gravity. Most cities rely on water towers. These have two purposes. They store water. (So a pump can be run at full speed to fill the tower, then turn off until the tower is needed.) They’re what maintain water pressure. To do this, water towers are usually built on hills and they’re often the tallest things around. So as long as your house is lower than the water tower, gravity will end up pushing the water down to you, because the overall drop of the water tower is greater than the height of your second-story ceiling. But if you live in a high-rise building downtown, they have to pump it up there. Still, many buildings have a water tower of their own, built on the roof or the top floor. This gives you the pressure you need by making use of the power of gravity.
As it is infinite, it does not end. By “end” we understand merely the limit to which we can see with our present instruments. We call that limit the observable universe. Q: But if you could see something else beyond the edge of the universe, what would it be? A:
a nuclear power station has a radioactive material for fuel. It starts a chain reaction in which the neutrons hit the atoms of other materials, which then, in turn, also shoot out more neutrons. But these high-speed neutrons must be slowed down a little to have a better chance of hitting another atom. That's where the moderator comes in. There are several things that can perform this function, even just water. To control the reaction so that it will be spread out over time instead of releasing all that incredible energy at once, there are also control rods in the midst of the reaction, which also absorb the incoming neutrons instead of slowing them down. The explosions of these flying nuclei which break the atoms as a cue-ball breaks a billiard-table, create heat, an incredible amount of heat. This is absorbed by the primary circuit, a water-circuit which circulates around the core, keeping it cool and also absorbing the heat. It is then passed through a heat-exchanger where the primary water heats up secondary water (the primary water which has been subjected to radiation is not allowed to leave the building), and it is the secondary water which is converted into steam, which drives the engines. Nucleonic reactions are atoms losing pieces which hit other atoms and break them up, which creates heat. The heat is collected and used to run a steam-turbine.
A. In terms of direct observation, it is true that we can only know about the atom and its constituents in a theoretical way. However, we can be fairly sure they exist. We know that, for example, molecules are not made of just atoms.
The air is dry. The skin is wet. In the wind there is a lower pressure than in the still air, and so the moisture on the skin evaporates more quickly and also more quickly loses heat. You feel a cooling effect.
This is basically the same as having a cup of water and twirling it in your hand. The centrifugal force generated by a barrel roll is greater than the force of gravity. As a result, the liquid stays inside the cup. If you were to roll the plane on its wing, it wouldn't work.
Yes, the weight is a major factor. The shape of the blade is designed so that all the force is concentrated on one point of the blade. The extra weight gives the blade more 'punching' power. This was also the reason why in the late middle ages knights went to axes and maces, using their swords only as a sign of nobility and distinction, because they were ineffectual against plate armor.
All available paths are always available to the current, but the path with least resistance will naturally have the most current. Now, when the resistance of a human body is way lower or way higher than the alternative, then this “less resistance” rule is a reasonable way to predict the path that the most current will take. But that only applies to conductors and resistors. Insulators experience something called a breakdown where the resistance drops dramatically with sufficient current, that’s what causes arcing through the air. This means that the path with only a small lower resistance will instantly become the path with much less resistance when the voltage is sufficient.
It's about angular momentum. When the arms act like pendulums, they limit the direction of motion. That way, the legs can focus on acceleration instead of stability.
As the temperature increases, the viscosity of water diminishes. This change is sufficiently marked to produce a difference in the sound. It is the same as in engine-oil. Starting the car in cold weather sometimes creates unforeseen difficulties, for the cold oil is thicker and has to warm up before it can do its proper work.
Depending on how cold it is, when things freeze, they can only form ice crystals when there is a good place to begin the crystallization. The good places are for example sharp corners in the container, places where the liquid is disturbed by stirring or agitation. It's like putting a jigsaw puzzle together, it's easier to start with the edge pieces. So when a can of beer is sitting still in the icebox in a clean, smooth beer can, it has not much good place to begin with. This lets it cool a little below the freezing point before it begins to freeze. When you pour beer, you create good places for it to freeze when you pour it into the glass and mix everything up. When a few ice crystals have formed, the whole beer can begin to freeze. This is also true for boiling. If you heat water in a very clean glass in the microwave oven, you can bring it above the boiling point without it boiling. If you shake the glass or stir it with a spoon, it suddenly boils, which can be dangerous if you are not expecting it. It's the same thing, except that you need good places to begin the bubbles instead of the ice crystals.
Light has no mass but it does have momentum, and momentum is conserved! So when a photon bounces off the mirror of the sail, the momentum of the sail and the photon together must change if the momentum of the sail and the photon together is the same after the photon strikes as it was before! In more detail, less eloquently: * * * In classical physics, momentum requires mass, but that is only a partial picture; general physics is a more complete picture. * * * In general physics the equation E=mc2 is only a part of the equation E=mc2+2p2c, where p is momentum. Since light has no mass, we can reduce this to E=pc2, and for a photon with E=hc/l, where h is the Planck constant and l is the wavelength, we get: p = hc/l. So a shorter-wavelength (bluer) photon has more momentum!
In physics heat is energy that has been transferred from one body to another, from the warmer body to the colder one. Just think of ice cubes. Put ice in a warm room, and the energy of the warm room is transferred to the ice, warming it up and causing it to melt. And put a glass of water in a cold room and the energy is transferred from the water to the room, which lowers the temperature of the water, and eventually it freezes. So how does that relate to our body? All living organisms are actually an orchestra of complicated chemical reactions. You are alive because of many, many complex chemical reactions that are constantly taking place in your body. One simple example is the process of digesting food, in which the digestive enzymes produced by your body help digest your food. But you might remember from chemistry that temperature affects chemical reactions, so those digestive enzymes will not work properly if you are too cold, and will even start to break down if you are too hot. Because of this, cold-blooded animals like lizards must heat themselves up in the sun to be able to digest their food. But warm-blooded animals like you produce heat inside your body and carefully control the temperature of your body, to keep the chemical reactions inside you running smoothly. So you produce heat in order to keep the temperature inside you at just the right level. But you also try to cool down if you get too hot. For example, you sweat, or your blood vessels dilate. If you get too hot, your blood vessels dilate to allow heat to be dissipated from your body through the skin, and that’s why you turn red. When you are not able to control your body temperature properly—for example, because you are in a room that is much too cold or too hot—you begin to suffer. Eventually you can suffer very seriously. Hypothermia and hyperthermia are just names for the various symptoms you can experience if your body temperature is affected by too much heat or too much cold.
From what I know it's a soundproofing. Like a transfer of air from inside to outside. With one window open, the rushing air fights back. The sound of a helicopter is created. But with the second window open, the air has a path to escape, it runs through the second window and not through the window from which it came in.
You were created by your parents. The closed time-curvature necessary to form a causal loop in time is at best a theoretical possibility. More likely, the universe prohibits such loops. In the same way, it is theoretically possible to travel through space at any speed. But the universe is limited to a speed of c.
Water is more effective than air at absorbing and releasing heat. Air at room temperature releases heat 43 times faster than water at room temperature. Water also has a higher heat capacity, which means the amount of energy it takes to raise its temperature by 1 degree. It can absorb a great deal of heat from your body but rises in temperature by only a small amount. When you put your hand into water, it takes the heat away from your skin more quickly than air does. Your skin cools to the temperature of the water, but the still air cannot keep enough heat to cool your skin down to the room temperature. Therefore, water is always colder than air.
Every particle in a cloud of dust and hydrogen is moving basically in all directions. But they don’t quite cancel each other out. And when gravity collapses the cloud and (if there’s enough mass) a star forms, the disproportionate spin of the particles and molecules determines the speed. Reproduce this on every scale and it applies to everything.
To go up, one must push something else down. On the ground, this is easy, but when you're in the air, you've only got the air and whatever you're carrying.
I don't know why this was flagged, it's not a question, there's a clear answer. The universe is big, and has always been big. We can already see very old light (it's called the cosmic background radiation), and JWST will be the best view ever. The light is old because it's been traveling for a long time, because it came from a long way away. When it was emitted, it was billions of light-years away from the matter that eventually became Earth (but not 13.1 billion light-years away, because space expands and because of relativity). The universe didn't start as a single point, so it didn't start from one place and go outward. The Big Bang was the universe going outward from everywhere.
This is the best way I know of explaining it. Picture a container which contains four marbles. Think of all the possible positions the marbles can be in; they could be at the bottom of each corner, they could be in the top corners or in any number of other positions. Now increase the size of the container. That means the marbles can occupy more positions. Entropy is simply the number of possible positions molecules can occupy within a given space. The greater the number of possible arrangements, the greater the entropy. So let’s take one more example. Suppose you put a rubber ball in an oven and turn on the heat, which causes the ball to contract. Now the ball is smaller inside the oven because it’s contracted. Would you say the entropy of this system is higher or lower than it was before? Since the ball is smaller, but the oven is the same size, the entropy is higher. A third example. When comparing the different states of matter – solid, liquid, and gas – solids are more ordered. The particles are closer together and hence there are fewer possibilities of arrangements. On the other hand, in gas form the particles are further apart and therefore can take up more arrangements within a given volume.
It would not spoil because it would immediately dry out, since at such low pressures water boils at room temperature. (And with neither water nor oxygen available, bacteria would have a hard time.) However, it wouldn't last forever. It would be bombarded with cosmic rays until the molecules disintegrate.
The surface of any object is not perfectly smooth, but has rough or smooth spots. The rough spots make the object slide on each other. Friction between the surfaces produces a force that resists motion. This force is called friction.
What you are asking is, how do individual organisms, and even the enzymes in them, restructure molecules? It is all a matter of patterns. Take the following example: the molecule: to the enzyme: “Hello, molecule. Nice little set of keys you have there. I’ve got a lock for it. Don’t know why, but I don’t like it very much.” “Whoosh, that’s nice, let’s go.” “Ha-ha, I’ve just cut off your arm. But don’t worry. Just use your right hand to grab the stump of your left arm. Take my word for it.” “You crazy fool, this is so cool!” (To another molecule) “Hey, I’ve got an arm here. You want it?” [Chemist explains:] Enzymes break molecular structures with stronger binding properties. That’s the case for only a small part of them. There are more ways to break molecular structures than simply cutting off an arm. But I thought that was the funniest thing I’ve ever heard.
The difference between room temperature and hot things is greater than between room temperature and cold things. A cold thing at the freezing point, which is 41° Fahrenheit, is about 15° colder than the room, whereas a hot thing, in order to keep the food safe, must be kept at a temperature of about 140° Fahrenheit, or 27° hotter than the room. Another reason is that the vacumn-seal only prevents conduction of heat because there is no way to conduct, but it cannot prevent radiation, which is caused by the heat-emitting bodies emitting small quantities of radiant heat, at our temperatures, usually infrared. Although the containers are silvered to limit this effect, the radiative exchange is so great that a very hot thing may overcome this effect.
Basically, wave-particle duality is pretty well understood and described by quantum mechanics, it's only classical mechanics that has trouble with it. The basic quantum mechanical object is the wavefunction, which can be more or less localized (particle-like or wave-like).
Electrons have weight and mass, but electricity is not the same as the electron. Electricity is the movement of the electron. Like the atmosphere, electricity has weight, but perhaps the movement of the air does not have weight.
they can gimbal their engines (or at least some of them, if they have several). This is called gimballing if the entire engine is moved, gimbal being the name of the support that allows for this. In addition, they have all kinds of tricks inside the nozzle for directing the thrust. But whichever way you cut it, they have a way of keeping the direction.
The problem isn’t the speed but the braking. If you have to come to a halt from 10, 50, or 100 mph in the same time, the 100 mph one will, obviously, be the hardest one to stop, but if you can come to a halt at a higher speed gradually, it may be less dangerous than coming to a stop at a low one. Your car’s crumple zones, air bags, and other safety devices are all designed to reduce the time you (or, more precisely, your head) take to come to a halt. You can jump from a great height into water and come out relatively unharmed, but falling face-first onto concrete may hurt you badly or kill you; the water slows you down gradually, the concrete stops you suddenly. Similarly, when you drive into a tree or into a wall, you stop very suddenly even at low speeds, despite all the safety devices designed to help you. If you ski into a tree at high speed, it can be very deadly. When you ski into the snow and fall over, it takes you a few seconds and several yards to come to a halt, which makes it a lot less deadly. Wearing a helmet, wearing warm clothing, and falling onto relatively soft snow all help. The less you stop, the less danger.
Besides X-rays, alpha, beta, and neutrons, gamma rays are dangerous because they have enough energy to strip the atoms they strike of their electrons. This is what cleaves the molecular bonds, and even though the damage to large molecules in a large structure is not usually caused in the short run, it does occur over a period of time, and the most familiar example of this is the breakdown of polymers under the influence of sunlight. In the body, important cellular parts such as the DNA strands are pounded to bits by gamma ray bullets, and so they can no longer perform their functions. In the short run, the cells die, and a person falls ill or dies. If one survives the acute radiation, other damage, such as DNA damage, may be observed in later life.
Quantum mechanics. He lives in a dimension of time and space that we humans cannot yet comprehend.
If you ask how, then I must answer that a single packet doesn’t get divided into two packets. One packet spreads itself, goes through the two slits and spreads out in interference beyond the slits. All this is one photon.
The discovery of the atom was made in 1827 by Robert Brown. Einstein only explained how the speed of Brownian movement could be used to determine the size of the atom and molecules. (Einstein published the special theory of relativity in 1905, the theory of the quanta of radiant energy, and the theory of Brownian motion, all in 1905, all in his spare time, because during the day he worked as a patent attorney. These three very basic works could have been the peak of a whole career, but he went even further in his later years.) And their size was only roughly known, from a comparison between the heat of vaporization and the surface tension, made around 1805 by Thomas Young of the double-slit experiment and the famous astronomer and mathematician Laplace. (See: https://www.lumenlearning.com/physics/chapter/30-1-discovery-of-the-atom)
It adds its own weight to the weight of the water in the pool. That is to say, if you had a balance scale at the bottom of the container, it would increase in value by the amount of the added weight. But there is a common "trick" question: If a stone is floating in a boat, and if you take the stone from the boat and drop it into the pool, will the level go up or down? (A: It will go down. Because on the boat, the stone displaced the water by its weight, but at the bottom it only displaces the water it occupies, which is smaller.)
If it's shot really straight up, it stops completely in the air when it reaches its maximum height. It loses its aerodynamic shape and on its way down it tumbles and falls... not in a safe way, but its maximum speed when falling is much lower than it would be. The Mythbusters have already done the test. I would not like to be hit, but I think you would survive it if you had a half-decent helmet. If it's shot diagonally up, it will continue to retain its aerodynamic shape, and if it reaches its maximum height, it will come down as a fatal projectile, with its front edge, even if it comes down from a distance. There are already cases of people who were killed at a great distance, when someone shot up. The Mythbusters called it a busted, a confirmed and a plausible myth, because there were already real cases of people being killed, but also it is a hard thing for a human being to point the gun up and fire. Shooting straight up is not lethal, but you don't have to do it that way, because you wouldn't do it that way.
Because there is so little pigment to so much base that you have to stir and stir and stir to make sure that the little bit of pigment gets through that whole five-gallon bucket. The viscosity and the lack of space to move around in the can also contribute to this. It would be better if the pigment dissolved in the base, as a dye does in water. But in fact paint is just a vehicle for the pigment.
Gravity is a fundamental force, for which, as far as we know, there is no reason why. It is. All matter with mass experiences an attractive force on all matter with mass, or all mass curves space-time, if you’re an Einsteinian.
As a flight attendant said, it's a loophole. A: Airline pilot here, I think you were on some regional jet, such as EMB-145, CRJ-700, CRJ-900, etc., since you said "below," and the EMB-145 and CRJ-200 are "above"; and as for large aircraft, almost never face such conditions. On the other hand, the weight of carry-on luggage is included in the weight of passengers. At my company, the average passenger weight was increased a few days ago, and the average passenger weight is reviewed every year. When the aircraft is used on the runway, the weight of the aircraft should not exceed the weight of the expected runway. The takeoff runway at a large airport is usually long, and the maximum takeoff weight can be greater, and at a small airport, the prevailing wind is one runway, and it is more limited. Other reasons include: the distance to accelerate and stop (V1), obstacles to climb, the altitude of the airport, and other unknown factors. I hope this helps. Edit: you didn't say "below", so any of them should be okay. Edit2:? "?
Why does it? The “why” questions are not genuinely answerable in science. They are actually irrelevant. That’s how mass in space-time works. That’s the way the universe works. It used to be thought that gravity was a force, and scientists searched for a graviton to transfer the force. But there has been no graviton. This has scientists stumped.
Probably this light has a large amount of invisible light in it, but you can't see the exact amount of it. This price tag has an orange fluorescent pigment that absorbs short-wavelength light, and it can be lighted up with any short-wavelength light. Blue light has the most striking effect, because it can't be seen from the sides, but it seems that it can also be lit up with this.
They are created. They appear. This is not uncommon in high-energy physics. Particles like the photon require much less energy to be created than do the other particles, and consequently they are much more easily created. The creation of an electron-positron pair can occur in sufficiently intense electric fields, but for the creation of a proton-antiproton pair it would require a much higher intensity.
Time is the distance between events, just as space is the distance between objects. Nothing can experience time backwards.
Both. There is no fixed radius of danger around it. It’s not like some kind of a definite bubble around the material, in which you are fried, but outside the bubble nothing happens. But the radiation does weaken the further away you get. If you had twice as much radioactive material, you’d get twice as much radiation up close, and also twice as much radiation at ten metres, fifty metres, and a kilometre away.
If you weigh 98 pounds and you eat one pound of carrots, you’ll be 1% carrot. If you weigh 98 kilograms and you eat one kilogram of carrots, you’ll be 1% carrot. There’s nothing inconsistent in these two facts, and from the way you ask the question I think you’ve got a few misconceptions about percentages.
you can absolutely mirror radiowaves. A satellite dish does just that, focusing all incoming radio waves onto a single point in the center of the dish.
Everything is made up of atoms. The outer part of an atom is composed of particles called electrons. Every atom has a fixed number of them. If the atom has more or fewer than it should, it is called an ion. Since ions have an unequal number of electrons, they want to get to the right number. When an atom has a surplus of them, it is said to be positively charged. If it has a deficit, it is negatively charged. You know how magnets have north and south poles. They are just a kinder way of saying positive and negative. Things with opposite charges attract each other because they want to swap their ions so they are all the same. When you rub certain materials together, one of them loses an atom to the other, making one positively charged and the other negatively. We say they are ‘static’ because they will not touch until they have swapped their ions. If they are positively charged and you hold them near a wall, they stick because the wall’s atoms have a normal number of ions but the static object wants to steal them. It eventually does, and then the difference in charge between the wall and the object is lessened and the object falls off. This does not permanently charge the wall because the wall is so big and it is also connected to earth. If the wall has a charge, it takes ions from the earth until it no longer has one. If it was a magical, floating house, it would be able to build up a charge. (Or you would need to build it in such a way that the earth could not take it, but that would be very dangerous.)
The car and you are going at the same speed. Then the car suddenly slows down. You still want to go on and go on, and you are stopped by the seat belts from going straight through the windscreen. All the soft parts of your body keep moving forward as far as possible, around the seat belt. All the soft parts of your body have stretched out, and all the kinetic energy is now stored in the stretched parts. They bounce back like a spring. The stored energy is transformed back into kinetic energy, but the arrow is pointing in the opposite direction—towards the back of the car. As an added bonus, the secondary collisions can also propel the car forward, if it’s not a head-on collision. But, in the simplest case, you rebound from the seat belt or from the dashboard just as anything else does. The whole point of the seat belt is that it gives you a much larger surface to rebound against than your face or knees. The seat belts also have a bit more give than the hard steering wheel of yesteryear, so they absorb some of the shock. EDIT: I forgot about the secondary effect. Depending on how the car is pushed, the front might dip down while the back rises up. If the car leans up like this, a lot of the energy of the collision is transformed from kinetic into potential energy, and the weight of the car is loaded against the front. Then, when the back leans back down, the result is to push you back like the hammer of a trebuchet. The seat belts are just a small trebuchet. The trebuchet can now get you back where you came from—which is into the seat. But it’s extremely important to adjust the headrest when you get into a car that has them. It should be high enough so that when you lean back, the center of your head is lined up with the center of the headrest. This will stop your head rather than your neck, and prevent you from going backwards, twisting your spine and neck.
I think you are imagining the middle C of the piano. This produces a wave that oscillates at 264 cycles per second. This means your ear hears a wave that vibrates 264 times a second. Imagine playing middle C while someone is speaking to you. You will distinguish the piano from the person, but your ear hears only the vibrations in the air. The brain is able to distinguish between the sounds of the voice and the piano, because of the software, not the hardware, which is what your ear is. Speakers produce sound waves that are precisely at the frequency of the different instruments of the recording. It vibrates your ear at the right frequency. Your brain can then tell which bits are the drums, bass, guitar, voice...
No sound, no noise. Noise is vibration. Vibration takes energy. If you imagine solid matter as points connected by springs, the stiffer the springs, the louder the vibration. The stiffer the spring, the more energy it takes to deform it. But the stiffer the springs, the more energy they have to give up to go back to their original positions. That's why stiffer materials make more noise because they let out more energy in the air as vibration.
But that should only make the car go forward. Where does it get the force to move it sideways? They are pushing the car forward. But since the front wheels are turned, where the car is going is constantly changing. The rear wheels are moving fast enough, and the front wheels are turned sharp enough, that there is basically a "lag" between where the rear wheels want to go and where the front wheels are heading. The rear wheels are pushing the car forward, but the front wheels are pushing the front of the car forward, so the rear of the car moves around the point of rotation.
The motion of the universe, or the motion of everything in it, with respect to its own center of mass, c. It is a common misunderstanding of special relativity, and the concept of speed. Speed is the spacetime equivalent of velocity; it measures how fast something is moving in spacetime (that is, space * and* time), and must be the same for all inertial observers (the most basic assumption of SR). Since the only speed-like quantity that is the same for all inertial observers is c, the so-called speed of light, “the speed limit,” “the universal speed,” “the speed,” etc.), then speed “4” must be c by definition, and the mathematics works out to be c. But that doesn’t really tell us anything useful. And it isn’t the “c” that we usually think of as “the speed of light,” but a “4” speed, a subtle distinction. It isn’t even the sum of speed 3 and speed of light, but more like the difference between them. In general, there is no such thing as absolute speed, unless you count c. Motion (not acceleration) is always relative to someone; you can always find a frame of reference in which something appears to be motionless (yourself, for example, from your own point of view).
Probably not. As we said, we have a pretty good idea of what happened in the universe up to about one picosecond after the event that is conventionally called the big bang, which is about 0.000000000001 seconds (more or less). Before that, the universe was roughly a million billion billion times smaller than an atom. At this scale, the laws of general relativity (the apparent laws that seem to govern the whole universe and large things in it) clash directly and unavoidably with the laws of quantum mechanics (the apparent laws that govern how small things act). Both seem to be flawed when applied to a sardine tin containing the whole universe squeezed into a space smaller than anything we can imagine. In a certain sense, the mathematics don't work. We'd have to 'divide by zero' in a literal and figurative sense, and our mathematics don't allow this.
A Tesla coil is a special kind of electrical circuit that is designed to generate very powerful radio signals. It is achieved by the high voltage of the air in which some low-ionizing gases are created and in which their atoms are disintegrated. This causes the low-ionizing gases to be ionized.
The more violent and abrupt sound is caused by the bullets striking the target. The smoother, mechanical, steady thud is the sound of the gun firing. You hear them separately because bullets travel at a speed far exceeding that of sound. Of course, you can hear the same effect with a turret on other aircraft, and this is not exclusive to the A-10 and its GAU-8 gun. But the A-10 is more well known because the GAU-8 is a larger and louder weapon, which is almost exclusively used in ground attack. Since it is mainly seen in the Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq wars, it is also more familiar.
It is a very wide term. If two particles interact, it means they have an effect on each other, and it can happen in many ways. The simplest example is that of two particles of the same charge, which repel each other when they come close together. This is a manifestation of the electromagnetism force. If an electron and a proton come near each other, the effect on them is a force that is attractive rather than repulsive, because of their opposite charges. But there are also complex cases in which the particles change into other kinds of particles, for example when an electron and a positron (the antiparticle of the electron) come close to each other they annihilate and emit two photons, and two photons can also produce a positron and an electron.
It’s basically the same thing as... light. You know how light gets redder the longer its wavelength? Well, if you go all the way down you get radio waves. That’s why we can’t see them.
There is a subtlety here. Particles of the EM spectrum (photons) do not actually move up and down. Particles in the EM spectrum only cause vibrations. They do not move up and down. However, a mechanical wave (such as sound) can be considered a result of the interactions of the neighboring particles. If you imagine the atoms of a solid as a string of particles, connected by springs, which represent the forces between particles, then, if you take one of these particles and pull it up, you will see that these forces on the neighboring particles will push it down. Newton's third law says that for each force there is an equal and opposite reaction. The neighboring particles move up when they pull the original particle down. Now more particles are pulled up, they are pulled down by their neighbors, and their neighbors are pulled up again. So on and so forth. The original displacement then spreads along the material like a wave of up and down motion.
We are currently watching literally millions of objects, from tiny fragments to large dead satellites. The ISS station is protected by what is called Whipple shielding. It's like a heat sink for a graphic card. There are a lot of small and thin rods. Space junk is moving so fast that it usually disintegrates at impact, sometimes even to molten metal or even to a completely different state of matter, to plasma. The first layer of Whipple is very thin and would not be able to stop the collision itself. But he breaks the space junk at the first collision. The resulting collision is therefore distributed over a larger area that Whipple can protect against. In addition, the station moves away from the space junk that we follow so closely. If there is even a tenth of a collision risk, the station is just moved so that the tracked junk passes by. It still happens, however, that we get hit. This year, for example, one of the parts of the station's robot arm was hit and damaged by a fragment, and we had to repair it in space. Kurzgesagt has a great video about how problematic orbital debris is in the long run.
Induction is the principle at work. The charger has a coil that conducts electricity. This creates an electro-magnetic field, which charges the phone. Inside the phone, a special rectifier, which converts the EM field into electricity, recharges the battery. However, the conversion has some losses, and it's only about 92% efficient compared to the charging via a wire. And it's slower.
It is certainly possible. See en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor. The problem is to extract more energy than you put in, including losses due to ion collisions and other factors, so that the reaction is sustainable. (And also to get enough saleable energy out to pay for what you put in.)
On the Planck scale, the laws of physics break already. If a photon were to have a wavelength of that size, it would also break the laws of physics. Some have tried to fix this problem. It is actually not a great thing that something "breaks conventional physics". This has happened in the past, and we have got over it. It just means that our models are somehow lacking.
If you see a right particle, then you know that the entangled left one is a left particle. But nobody else knows unless you tell them the right one. If someone tries to measure the left twin, the entanglement is broken and the result is random. The other would have to ask you if the result is correct. This takes us back to the speed of light. Measurement and interference break the entanglement. Quantum mechanics say it decoheres. That means the particle enters the system of the one who measures it. (EliannaRys' answer is better.)
It is simpler. We would have to change a lot of equations and cause many confusions. Wouldn't we have to reverse the magnetic field too? Or, do we make many of the equations negative? Or, we just change the sign of the negative charge and call it positive? Why? No one who is supposed to know the difference ever gets confused, and it does not really matter to most people.
Red  orange  yellow  white  blue; It will become blue hot when you heat it far enough, but in reality it cannot become blue hot. 6500K is the color temperature of the sun, and 8000K is the color temperature of the blue. At this time, iron is about 3,000K. Even tungsten is about 5,800K.
why not ask her and have her explain them to you on your date?
- There is no such thing as "traveling with a certain force. " Something can be accelerated for a certain time with a certain force and then go at a certain speed. But the mass of the object and the time it takes to accelerate are also factors.
Everything reflects the light that falls on it. The difference with mirrors is that they reflect light in the same way it came in, without destroying it. For example, if the light is reflected at right angles to the mirror's surface, it will also be reflected at right angles. If it comes at an angle, it will be reflected at an angle. This is always the case; the mirror is not changing according to your movements, but you are moving to a position where you can see what it has always reflected.
