Well, we have helicopters, airplanes, rocket ships... Our best understanding of gravity is that it's just a fundamental property of anything that has mass. Imagine four people are holding a sheet, at all four corners. The sheet is perfectly level, and you can roll a marble from one end to the other in basically a straight line. Now, toss an orange into the center. It sags down under the weight of the orange. Now when you try to roll a marble from one end to the other, it falls towards the orange. Gravity is like that, but in three dimensions. Anything that has mass "bends" spacetime towards it, so that anything traveling nearby is pulled off course, or possibly towards it. Gravity isn't a "thing" or a "force" as much as it is a property of the universe.
It has to do with the amount of "advantage" the lever and winch give you. Levers and pulleys let you move heavy things by transforming a weak but large movement into a small but strong movement. When you use the come-along/winch, your arm will move the end of a long lever by one meter, and transform that into pulling a heavy load a centimeter. By turning a one meter movement into a centimeter movement (dividing the distance by 100), you are multiplying the strength by 100. So if you can exert enough force by hand to lift 50 kg, with the come-along you can lift 5000 kg. When you are using a ratchet strap to strap down a load, the lever you are moving is much smaller, so it moves a smaller distance. So, if the end of the lever moves 10 cm and that tightens the strap by 1 cm, it's multiplying your strength by 10. So, your strength of 50 kg gets transformed into a strength that can lift 500 kg. So, once the strap is so tight it's like 500 kg is pulling on it, your 50 kg strength isn't enough to tighten it any further. So basically, a come-along has a longer lever to give you more advantage.
The simple answer is "because it passes infinitely many points in any positive amount of time". It may help to remember that the *time* it takes to move contains infinitely many moments in the same way that the unit distance contains infinitely many points.
The air inside the car \*is\* still at 25 degrees. However, it's moving very fast with the window open, and moving air that is cooler than your body temperature feels as if it's colder than stationary air does--this is the "wind chill factor" you might have heard on weather reports occasionally. This is the same reason a fan blowing on you feels cooler even though the air it's moving is exactly the same temperature as the rest of the room.
It can't.  That's not true at all.  There are plenty of times when it is not visible when it is night where you are because the world isn't flat.
An absolute vacuum has no matter at all in it. It is literally a void, or void of matter. Space on the other hand is the space outside of a planets atmosphere and has helium from the sun's solar wind, spacecraft, asteroids, comets, and all sorts of other interesting things a vacuum by definition cant have.
Pushing the bulbous part does NOT create a vacuum, no. It just pushed the air in the balloon towards the end of the pipette. If you release your fingers and the balloon wants to return to it's initial round form (we come to that later on again), then the fluid at the entrance gets pushed in. The atmosphere that is in contact with the fluid pushes the fluid into the pipette. It does this because the balloon has some tension in its surface, and it wants to be round and flat, and not squeezed together. So as it opens up, the additional volume created within the balloon is filled due to the pressure from the outside atmosphere pushing onto the surface of the fluid, which in turn gets pushed into the pipette Awesome question, BTW!
This is known as cavitation. As a bullet travels through water, or a blade spins quickly through water, they create pockets of low pressure behind them. If the pressure is low enough then the water turns from liquid to gas, and this is the source of the bubbles. The bubbles are composed of water vapor.
Hearing scientist here, with a PhD in sound localisation. Electronic beeps are usually very clean sine waves, like the stereotypical wave.  They are often high pitched. One of the ways we would out where a round comes from is by the difference in arrival time between the two ears.  The sound arrives sooner at the nearer ear.  But this only really works for complicated sounds with lots of different frequencies (pitches) or lower sounds.  Why?  Well for higher sounds, the wavelength is close to the size of the head.  If you miss the start of the sound, it's impossible to tell which ear is ahead and which is behind because each copy of the wave looks the same.  With lower sounds, it's easier because the size of the head sets a limit on how ahead or behind a wave could be.  With more complicated sounds, you can compare the whole complicated signal to work out which ear got the earlier 'copy'. The other main way we work out locations is using the level difference between the two ears.  This works best for higher sounds because lower sounds can bend around the head better and so the levels are more similar. If the sound happens to be in the middle of these two ranges, you can't really use either method to work out where it is.  Even if you *can* use level differences, the head is pretty symmetric.  We can tell left from right, but it's hard to work out front from back or top from bottom.  The way round this is by moving your head.  But if the sounds are short beeps, you've barely got any chance to figure it out before the beep ends.  It makes it tricky for your brain to combine the info from successive beeps. This is the reason that Tesco vans in the UK now use a burst of noise (like static on a radio) instead of a beep when they reverse. Edit: thanks, kind strangers :) happy to be of help.  I guess I'll take this opportunity to tell you to not use cotton buds (Q-tips) unless you want a perforated eardrum, and remember to wear protection.  Ear protection, that is.  Gigs are loud!  Get some decent earplugs.  Noise-induced hearing loss isn't fun, and there's nothing we can do to cure it (...yet)
Having two eyes in front of your face allows you to see from two angles at once, which your brain can convert into depth. There’s a whole bunch of other things happening, but basically you can use the speed and direction to guess where something will be next. Practice is how you hone it and why you’re good at it, but the mechanics are a combination of spatial recognition and predicting new position based on speed and direction.
Those doors are designed to open inward.  With the increased air pressure, it acts as a force to keep the door in place.
Moving electrons make electrical energy  which we use to do work. In DC the electrons move in one direction, in AC they move back and forth. Think of a hand saw trying to cut down a tree. The one repressing DC  can only be pushed, so you need a really, really long blade, to get all the way through the tree. The One representing AC can be pushed AND pulled so you only need a short blade to cut the tree down.
To be very specific:The issue is that *momentum* and *position* can't both be measured *to infinite or arbitrary precision, simultaneously*, which is a principle that comes to us from quantum mechanics. So there's two issues there: * infinite or arbitrary precision * simultaneously Interestingly, it's not literally an issue of "why can't you *know* both".  In other words: It's not that those variables "have" values which are simply unknowable "in practice".  Rather, in the early 20th century, with quantum mechanics, it was shown that those two variables literally can not have simultaneous physical values with infinite or arbitrary precision. And it's not just for momentum & position.  There are [many different combinations of variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_commutation_relation) that behave like that in the quantum mechanical description. You can experiment to build intuition, if you have audio editing software.  If you select pulses or "sinc functions" from the waveform generator menu, you can flip back and forth between the audio waveform and the "Fourier transform" of that same data. If you experiment in that way, you'll see that you can't simultaneously represent a thin pulse in both the audio waveform and the Fourier spectrum. These principles aren't noticed by us in daily life, because the consequences are far too tiny to be measured by things like rulers and speedometers for things like people or cars.
Because much of math was explicitly designed to mimic the behavior of the universe and the universe, for some reason, appears to obey an underlying set of laws that do not change.
We can transfer electrical energy long distances with low losses and reasonably cheap infrastructure. We can also modulate it to send signals. Also we are good at moving backwards and forwards between electricity and other forms of energy. Other common ways of transferring energy: heat, but there are losses when moving long distance; kinetic, but infrastructure to transfer motion over long distances (a series of shafts?) would be massive; chemical, but we aren't good at converting chemical energy directly into motion without going via heat (hydrocarbons and combustion engines) or electricity (batteries and motors, fuel cells).
Because they are very far away.  If you take a stick and hold it at one end and tilt it, you'll see the other end of the stick moves quite a lot, even if you only tilt it a bit, and the longer the stick is, the more the end moves. It's the same with our vision: the further away an object is, the less we have to tilt our head to keep track of it, and because we have to move our head so little to track it it appears quite slow to our brains, because our brains are surprisingly bad at understanding 3 Dimensionsal space
A typical formula used to convert RGB colours to grayscale is: 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B which is in agreement with your experience.  Also, the [human luminous efficiency function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficiency_function) shows less sensitivity at the blue end of the spectrum than at the red, although note that the situation is reversed for the dark-adapted eye (scotopic vision).
Lenses bend light, changing the direction of said light. Light gets shifted when it changes between mediums.  Like how a straw looks disjointed when looking at it in a cup of water. Lenses are used to focus that light into an image. In order to bend the light just right you have to make the edges of the glass curved. The relationship between the edges allows you to magnifying or shrink the perceived image by changing the direction each little bit of light takes.  This let's you focus it. If you made a purely square lens it would be hard to make sure all of the image is in focus at the same time because the curves on the edges of the glass wouldnt be the same all the way around. Film is square/rectangular because it's an easy shape to store.  Not to mention people historically were pretty used to rectangular paintings. You could cut your film negatives into any shape and they would work, but a strip of film is generally most efficient as a long line of squares or rectangles. If you had circular film it would have a bunch of unused gaps in the plastic you're using to hold the film.  Which is wasteful in a device with very little room to spare.
The star is sending light out in all directions, so some photons hit your eyeballs and some land six feet to your left. Stars send out an unimaginable amount of light every second, so much so that it’s still visible despite dispersing out for trillions of miles.
Angular momentum (the amount stuff is spinning around a particular point) is always conserved. In any sink/tub/whatever of water you've got a little bit of random motion and the angular momentum around the drain generally isn't zero. As the water drains it moves closer to the center and the only way to conserve angular momentum is to speed up, like an ice skater pulling their arms in during a spin. That forms a spiral as the water is increasing it's spin while it flows in towards the drain. It's theoretically possible to have it drain straight in but that is statistically nearly impossible.
This often happens with spinning things in videos. This is due to the frame rate of a video and how it compares to the period of rotation of what is being recorded.  For example, if your video takes thirty frames per second and a wheel spins thirty times per second, it means each time a frame is take, the wheel has just completed a complete revolution, making the resulting video appear as if the wheel is not moving at all. If the wheel spins a little bit faster, like 30.1 times per second, each frame of video will have the wheel just a little bit more rotated than the previous, making the wheel appear to be rotating slowly. The wheel can even appear to be rotating backward if it rotates just a bit slower than the frame rate as each frame is taken just before the wheel completes a revolution relative to the previous frame. The same thing applies if the wheel spins 60 times per seconds. It rotates twice between frames, but at the moment the frame is taken, the wheel is in the same orientation as the previous frame.
AM radio only needs a very simple circuit to "demodulate" the audio signal; a rectifier. A poor quality rectifier circuit can sometimes be created quite by accident, such as by having two dissimilar metals in contact, or a metal and a conductive solution. Metal fillings and saliva can do it! @@@   @@@If the radio signal is very strong, it can overcome the lousy efficiency of such a circuit and make things vibrate just like a speaker would.
They are colour temperature not literal temperature.  The colour temperature is obtained using different wavelengths of light.
Trucks are *heavy*. Driving downhill means the brakes need to constantly be slowing down their heavy loads, building up heat in the brakes. Unfortunately brakes become less effective as they get hot, meaning longer periods of braking are required which makes them *more* hot, etc. Overusing brakes can result in the loss of braking ability which would lead to a massive uncontrolled load hurtling down the mountain. A slope and some sand built beside the road is a minor investment to prevent a likely lethal crash.
Depends what you mean by "time and space" and what you mean by "have a beginning" and "an end". "time and space" could be time the human metric and space as in some area or volume. Or it could be spacetime the four dimensional manifold.  @@@"have a beginning" and "have an end" could be a time when a thing does and doesn't exist (*to end*, *to begin*, the verbs), or could be physical or unphysical boundaries on a variable, (**an end**, **a beginning**, the nouns). Time the human metric can't *end* because it's fundamentally a description of how fast certain things happen, and how long it takes them to do the thing however many times. It can't *end* because it isn't a thing, it's an idea. A day is about 7.942×10^(14) periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of a Caesium 133 atom. That won't *end*. It's derived from a rate, not an intrinsic universal property.  @@@It arguably has **an end** when humans stop existing to use the concept, and **a beginning** when the first humans started to measure duration, but that's a bit too philosophical imo. Space, an area or volume, can definitely have **beginnings** and **ends**, and this is the easiest one to wrap your head around. A football pitch has **ends** that are **beginnings** and vice versa, it's just the edge of the area. The observable universe has **an end**/**beginning**, the point at which light has not yet had enough time to reach us, so it is fundamentally impossible for us to see or travel beyond.  @@@A football pitch could *end* and *begin* when it's demolished or torn up and when it's constructed. The observable universe *began*, as in it started to exist when the universe became transparent to the CMB, and could possibly *end* either by ceasing to exist or due to another effect that makes the entire area unobservable. Big black hole gobbling up the Earth would do the trick (if there are aliens, they have a different observable universe). The trickier interpretation is "does spacetime have **and end**/**a beginning**" and "can spacetime *end*/did spacetime *begin*".  @@@Regardless of whether the universe is 'flat', 'open', or 'closed', it is probably spatially boundless. ([See here for a wikipedia article about the Shape of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe)). Basically this means, you can't ever travel to **the end**/**beginning** of the universe either because you'd come back around to where you started, would follow a path on a complex shape that wouldn't necessarily return to itself but only traverses a finite universe, or just keep going forever. The universe isn't temporally boundless though, and this is where really spacetime comes in. Spacetime is bounded by at least (we're pretty sure) the big bang. So you have a four dimensional manifold that has **a beginning** in one direction on one of its dimensions. One of the 'faces' of the boundless 4D cube that is spacetime has a location. Which is also its only face because the other directions are boundless. The 3D analogy is imagine a cube, then extend the cube out forever in the direction of 5 of the 6 faces. You can locate the last face still, but do the other faces even still really exist? That, but the axis you only extended in one direction isn't x, y, or z, it's time.  @@@It gets even trickier though, because spacetime is a manifold that includes time, and it doesn't exist beyond 13.7 billion years ago, you can't talk about 'times before the big bang'. It doesn't actually make sense. The big bang started time. If you identify any time before, then you would immediately no longer be talking about a time before, since time exists for you to specify where(when?) you mean on the manifold, so you can't be talking about before when spacetime existed. Which means **the beginning** of spacetime is also when spacetime *began*, but neither of those things happened at any time that can be defined non-trivially (i.e.: relative to anything except itself). Spacetime began at all spacetime coordinates where the time component is zero, so all across space (which didn't exist yet) at the same time (which wasn't a thing yet). Get it? No? Great. Moving on...  @@@Spacetime *might* have **an end**/might *end*. We dunno yet. There's a few theories you might have heard of; big rip, big crunch, etc. But for the same reason as **the beginning**, to say when it will *end* doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It *ends* at **the end**. Best you could do is predict the duration of the universe according to its own coordinate system, but given spacetime wouldn't exist anymore, there wouldn't be anywhere or anywhen to observe **the end** and measure it. That's not even addressing the fact that time is not a rigid march into oblivion. It proceeds differently for different parts of the universe, so you'd have a basically impossible task just deciding what to measure the total duration with. In summary,    - Time like on a clock: is a metric. Doesn't make sense for it to *begin*/*end*. Arguably has **a beginning** and could have **an end**.  @@@ - Space like your back garden. *Began* and may *end* when it started being your garden and if it ever stops being your garden. Has **beginnings**/**endings** but it's just a continuous boundary, not one or the other.@@@ - Spacetime *began* and had **a beginning** in the -ve direction of the temporal dimension. May *end* and have **an end** but we don't know. Nonsensical to try to say 'when' these events happened/were/will be, as you could only refer to them relative to themselves, which is just restating the point. It's a "Where are my keys?" "They're in the same place as your keys." kind of situation. @@@EDIT: I don't make it abundantly clear in this, but important to note that time is not the same as duration/time taken/time elapsed. Time can be defined with a single number, a duration necessarily requires at least two.
We know quite well what electricity is; it’s the transmission of power via the motion of electric charge. It’s apparent from the context and overall tone of the presentation that the presenter means “Most laypeople have misconceptions about how electricity works.”
Because, as it turns out, the train analogy isn't actually correct; velocities are not actually additive in this manner, it's just that the net error by using addition is inconsequential in most everyday situations. The train analogy is a bit of "common knowledge" that doesn't actually reflect physics. As it turns out; it doesn't matter how fast you're going or what direction you're moving in. Light (in a vacuum) always propagates at **precisely** c, no more, no less. There's an [*extremely* famous experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) that actually proved this to be true. Edit: on the train analogy; say you're on a train (moving X mph) and you fire a gun in the same direction as the train is moving (with a muzzle velocity of Y mph). At the same moment you fire the gun, you pass a person standing on the ground outside the train. Both of you now observe the bullet traveling in the same direction as the train. You observe the bullet to be traveling at Y mph (relative to you), and the outside observer observes you traveling at X mph relative to themselves, but they do *not* see the bullet travel at X+Y mph relative to themselves; instead, the bullets actual speed, relative to that stationary observer, is strictly less than X+Y, regardless of the velocities involved, and the faster and faster all of this occurs, the less and less adding the velocities is permissible and the more error is introduced. At the most extreme case (i.e. the bullet is fired at the speed of light), both you *and* the stationary observer see the bullet travel at precisely the same speed; c.
Because air is pretty light to start with Normal atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi but we'll use 15 for easy math.  If you have a little 20 liter air compressor then the air in the tank normally weighs 25 grams which isn't much.  If you turn on the compressor and bring the tank up to 15 psi (gauge pressure so its atmospheric+15=30 psi absolute) you now have twice as much air in the tank so it will weigh an extra 25 grams.  You're not worried about the 15 pounds that it says on the gauge because that is pushing outwardly inside the tank and only applies to the walls of the tank, not to the force you need to lift it. If you turn the pump up to 150 PSI (pretty high for a home shop) then the tank has 11x as much air in it and weighs an extra 275 grams, not too much. Lets say you get a really good compressor to go with your piddly tank and get it up to 3000 psi.  You now have 200x as much air in the same volume so it weighs an extra 5 kg which is significant.  This is an important considering for scuba tanks where losing weight as you use the air underwater slowly makes you more buoyant.
Splitting one atom isn't dangerous at all, the amount of energy it releases is minuscule. You wouldn't notice it at all, and in fact it would be very difficult to even *detect* if we tried. But the issue with radioactivity and nuclear reactions isn't about splitting one atom, it is about splitting a *bunch* of atoms all at once. When you split a billion billion atoms in a millisecond the amount of energy released is huge, and that is what is dangerous about nuclear reactions.
Do you mean videos of cars on a dyno? Cameras have frame rates, i.e. 30 frames per second, or FPS. So every 1/30th of a second, it takes a picture. These photos get played back quickly, and you have video. Imagine a six-spoked wheel. If it turns 1/6th of a rotation every 1/30th of a second, it'll appear to be not turning. In reality, it is, but the spokes are aligned in the same positions, so there won't be much of a visible change. If it speeds up and rotates a little more than 1/6th of the way every 1/30th of a second, every subsequent shot of the wheel will have the spoke positions slightly advancing. This will make it appear to be moving forwards slowly. Keep speeding up, and the wheel will rotate at just below 2/6ths of a rotation in 1/30th of a second. If it was exactly 2/6ths, it would appear to stand still again, but it's rotating a little slower, so the shots every 1/30th of a second will come short of 2/6ths. This will make it appear to be rotating backwards. Of course, this is just a camera effect. You cannot observe this with your eyes and a steady light. Florescent bulbs will flicker at 50 or 60 Hz, and can basically be a high-speed strobe light, so you can sometimes witness a similar effect with this type of lighting.
They are wrong. There is totally gravity in orbit around the Earth, that's what keeps the Moon going around us and not wandering off into space. In the ISS, and other orbital spacecraft, the ship and its contents are moving so fast that people inside experience microgravity because the Earth pulls on them and the ship and the air inside at all the same rate.  This keeps the whole system in orbit and makes it appear (relative to the walls of the space ship) that the people are floating weightlessly. Weightless ≠ No Gravity Weightless = No Net force holding you to the ship from Gravity
Large venue speakers are designed to be very directional because sound travels so slowly. They want the crowd to only hear the sound from one speaker because the sound from a speaker, say 33 metres farther away will be delayed by a tenth of a second. In a big sports arena the speakers on the far side of the ground will be delayed by a big fraction of a second and that’s very noticeable and muddles up the sound. The trick with low frequency sounds (bass) is that you can’t make directional speakers, at least not of a practical size. The wavelength of bass is so long that you’d need a huge speaker to direct the sound. So you can hear the bass coming from all over the venue and the bass you hear from the far speakers will be delayed very noticeably.
They use thrusters, which are tiny "rocket engines" (sometimes they just puff gas under pressure) on the sides of the ship.  Gravity actually has little to do with it - it's the lack of air that makes aerodynamic surfaces like ailerons and rudders ineffective.
Magnets don't get used up but they can lose their magnetism. Imagine a big magnet as millions of smaller magnets all facing the same direction. If you mess up their allignment the magnet loses its strenght...BUT as soon as you reallign them he regains it. Thats why you can remagnetize steel.
Mirror images aren't flipped vertically *or* horizontally. They're reversed along the front–back axis. Stand facing a mirror and point left/right (horizontally) or up/down (vertically), and you & your reflection will be pointing the same overall direction. Point into the mirror or away from it, and suddenly you and your reflection are pointing opposite directions.
Diameter difference. The entire item must turn the same number of times no matter the size of the two ends. But the fat end will travel farther in the same number of revolutions.
It's not "heavier". If you have any substance in a perfectly sealed container and freeze, melt, evaporate, condense it, etc. it will stay the same weight. Ice is less *dense*, because when it freezes (normal freezing that we are used to - there are other strange forms of water that take place under strange conditions), it forms a crystalline structure that makes it take up more *volume*. Same amount of stuff over higher volume = less density. Density is what makes it float on water.
There is a concept known as the fire triangle. The three legs of the triangle are air/oxygen, heat, and fuel. If any of the elements are missing or not available in large enough amounts, the triangle will "collapse" and the fire will go out. If you have a strong enough breeze, even though the fire's getting plenty of air, the breeze is cooling the fire faster than the fire can generate heat. Fire is only a chemical reaction, and it proceeds at a specific, finite rate, which means that it only produces heat at a specific, finite rate.
Because you have a suspension. When you brake the weight of the vehicle is shifted towards the front and the amount of force is increased on the front wheels. When the weight is released once you come to a stop any remaining energy stored in the springs is released and you get the little bit of jerk. Shock absorbers mitigate this somewhat but you still have something like 2000lbs of weight being placed on them. When you coast you have no weight transfer happening. The car is losing energy purely by friction. The springs don't get charged with energy and you don't get them releasing energy once you come to a stop.
Water absorbs Infrared specifically well, and as our skin is 80% water, we are perfectly adapted to feel Infrared heat
We can capture CO2, we use various methods to create industrial CO2 at high purity.  The problem is the cost associated with this and scaling it up to the quantities needed to make a difference One common way to just capture CO2 is adsorption.  You fill a tank with a special material that'll absorb CO2, then you pump high pressure air into that tank and fill the material up with CO2.  Now release the air, heat the material, and it'll release its CO2 that you can capture to create high purity CO2 for stuff like carbonating beverages.  This works well for making thousands of tons of CO2, unfortunately we release about 35 **Billion** tons of CO2 into the air every year as a result of power generation and industrial process If you capture that CO2 and want to turn it back into O2 and straight carbon then you need to put energy into it.  How much energy?  *At least* as much as was released when it became CO2 in the first place, which means now you're burning fuel and producing CO2 to generate power to capture and reprocess less CO2 than you just made?  This doesn't scale very well Plants do it by capturing millions of square kilometers of sunlight and using that to fuel their reactions.  We could build massive solar arrays (and we're working on it) but its generally easier to instead just plant trees and let them do their thing. Until we get fusion power up, running, and profitable there can be no carbon capture because it all just takes energy from fossil fuel sources to run which negates its impact
Because at the temperatures at which humans live, things glow mostly in the infrared, with that glow scaling up rapidly as things get warmer. If we lived at a higher temperature, the same would be true, but for visible light instead (as you can see by heating up a piece of high-melting-point metal, which starts by glowing dull red and eventually glows brilliant white).
Based on what I see on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_time) it looks like it’s a system in which in order to model the phenomena we need to us imaginary or complex numbers, rather than just the reals, to express time. It sort of like being in debt before there was a formalized system for negative numbers. You very much owe 10 units of something, but the positive whole number system can’t describe it, so using the integer system is needed.
Satellites very rarely, if ever, have lights. What you see is the sun reflecting off their solar panels or metal bodies  They are launched very frequently. For example, spacex sometimes has multiple satellite launches each month.
Cobwebs are spider webs. They are made of spider silk, a protein fiber produced by spiders as a way to trap prey or make a nest. The term cobweb is often used to refer to old, perhaps dusty abandoned webs.
Boiling = when the pressure outside the liquid is the same as the pressure inside the liquid. It can make evaporation happen faster. But evaporation naturally happens even below the boiling point - energy gets absorbed by water, that excites water molecules and the water at the surface breaks away from the rest to become vapor.
It's the basic problem that was encountered by the Manhattan project researchers: you want the bomb to explode, but you also want the fissile material to be compressed together densely so that it has time to get a good chain reaction going. So the problem becomes: how do you compress together a bunch of plutonium into a very dense sphere, at the same time that it is exploding? You actually increase the yield by slowing down explosion and keeping the bomb together for longer. But there's always going to be some amount of plutonium that gets thrown out of the bomb before fissioning completely so the theoretical efficiency is less that %100, unless we suppose sufficiently advanced technology that could hold together to core of the bomb for long enough
Nope. If you go to a supermarket in Estes Park, Co. (Elevation 7,500 ft) chip bags are fully inflated.
It's funny, but "hard" in this sense doesn't mean "indestructible", it just means "hard to scratch", or better yet "cannot be scratched by something less hard". An example might be glass, you can rub glass with a piece of wood and not scratch the glass, but if you throw the wood at the glass you can still shatter it. Wood is "less hard" than the glass, because it doesn't scratch it. Similarly you can scratch glass with a nail, because metal is harder than glass, but you probably won't shatter the glass by just throwing a nail at it. Simply put, hardness doesn't tell you how easy it is to break or destroy the material, just scratchability. Diamonds are so hard you can't scratch with pretty much any other material, but you can still cut or shatter them.
Its kind of a different mechanism: in an old light bulb, the wire heats up, and the heat causes it to create light through what we call “black body radiation”. It basically means the atoms of the wire jiggle very fast, and this motion creates the light we see. For LEDs, light is created using a different mechanism: we use electricity to move electrons across a barrier, and once they are over, they return to their normal state, releasing light. Kind of like pushing a rock over a hill. This is why it’s almost impossible to make wire bulbs with light that isn’t orange/yellow, since it requires insane temperatures that are unsafe for the materials or people around them. With LEDs, since you don’t need to heat up anything, you just need to find the right kind of material with the right “height” of the mountain such that the light is in the color you want.
Always does me as well I reckon its because I drink beer though and I'm pissing away lots of salt and such, body energy being used to warm cold pints of liquid. It flushes the good stuff out and needs replacing, ethanol and methanol poison really
When hitting a wall, pretty much all the energy of the collision is dissipated in the car's internal structures (and that energy is the one causing the actual damage). When two (identical!) cars collide, the total energy is greater, but it is spread evenly between two sets of identical structures. Of course, this will change if the cars are not identical :)
The more mass an object has, the more it warps spacetime around it. [Here is a visual](https://www.quora.com/If-gravity-is-caused-by-space-time-warping-what-determines-the-strength-and-direction-of-acceleration) to highlight this phenomena
I assume you refer to magnetic flux density.  For example the Earths magnetic field is large in the sense that it covers the entire planet but the magnetic flux density is small so that all iron objects are not permanently pointed north. For just a uniform magnetic field, the unit for magnetic flux density is gauss or Tesla.  1 Tesla = 10000 gauss.  It's hard to describe how strong that field is since it depends on the size and shape of a reference magnet but if your fridge was somehow emanating a 1Tesla field, a 1cm fridge magnet may require 2 or 3 pounds to pull off. For a metal permanent magnet with a distinct north and south pole, the strength is described by its magnetic moment, and the unit is emu per gram.
In general, things keep moving in a straight line unless you mess with them. A pendulum moves back and forward. Nice and simple process; you lift it up to one side, let it go and the pendulum swings in a straight line, and will keep doing that forever (ignoring friction). Now imagine putting a pendulum (with some kind of frame) on a rotating platform, like a microwave turntable (*do not do this at home!*). If the pendulum is hanging freely there will be nothing to turn it - [the pendulum will keep swinging back and forth as the turntable rotates beneath it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Foucault-rotz.gif). So what Foucault did in 1851 was [hang a giant pendulum from the dome of the Panthéon in Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Panth%C3%A9on_Pendule_de_Foucault2.JPG) (it was removed shortly after but temporarily restored in the 1990s). Over time the pendulum appeared to rotate. But pendulums shouldn't rotate. So if the pendulum isn't rotating, the rest of the Earth must be rotating underneath it, with the pendulum staying still! And this all happens in a regular, predictable way, so you can [use these pendulums as clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Foucault_pendulum_1.webm) by looking at how it appears to be rotating.
If you heat up your house with electricity that power resistive radiators the heating up the house with appliances have the same cost. If your heating is system is different, that include an electric-powered heat pump then it is less cost-efficient to heat up your house with appliances. I assume that any other heat source is more cost-efficient than electricity. @@@From an environmental perspective, it is a question of how your electricity is generated compared to other heating sources. Even if you heat up with electricity using heat pump will be better for the enivorment
Beer is a carbonated beverage. That means there is CO2 dissolved into the liquid well beyond its normal capacity to hold it. The CO2 will slowly escape until it reaches an equilibrium, but under normal conditions, this doesn't all happen at once. When you smack the bottle down, the bottle moves down very quickly. However, the liquid inside doesn't. This creates a vacuum under the liquid. This vacuum allows the CO2 in the bottle to dissolve out very quickly, helping to fill that vacuum. Then, as the liquid actually drops down, the CO2 will form a lot of bubbles, since it will essentially form clumps of gas in the liquid. This creates the rapid foaming. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMb6GNYPqXA@@@This video explores the bar trick of breaking the bottle by doing the same thing but with water in it, and they take a tangent on the beer-filled bottle.
> If the squealing sound only occurs during the use of hot water, the issue is probably associated only with your hot water pipes or faucet parts. Either the stem valve or washer on the hot water side is loose, or something is lodged inside of the hot water pipe. > Another possibility is pipe stretch. When the hot water enters the pipes, it causes expansion due to the temperature increase, and metal pipes stretch against their brackets, which causes a short squealing sound to occur. Replacing your pipe brackets and supports or pipes is the only way to resolve this issue.

simplified version: Electricity flowing through a wire causes a magnetic field. But it works the other way was well. A moving magnetic field can generate electricity in a wire. A big solar storm is a big knot of material that is electrically charged and moving quite fast by human standards. So there is a whirling mass of very powerful magnetic fields in that knot as well. Some times these storms manage to detach from the Sun and come flying our way. Our planet has its own magnetic field which make something called the Van Allen belt. This belt usually protects us from electrical, magnetic and radiation energy from the Sun. If the storm is powerful enough, it overwhelms the Van Allen belt and reaches Earth's surface. When that happens, every wire on the planet converts some of that energy into surplus electricity in the wire. The more powerful the storm, the more surplus electricity is created.  Most devices can't handle that extra electricity. Computer chips are very fragile in that sense, it is easy to burn out bits of it with too much power. Our electricity distribution grid has thousands of miles of wire, perfect for collecting a LOT of that solar energy. That can lead to blown transformers, damaged generators and so on.
The flowers will dry out over time. Moisture in a flower is what gives it its flexibility… over time the moisture evaporates and you are left with the rigid, fragile fibers of the flower. Flattened in a book, it will dry flat and stay that way.
When high pressure air, or any air for that matter, expands, its pressure and temperature drop. Any water vapor present in the air will condense once the air cools enough. This is the same process that causes clouds to form as well.
I'm going to answer with an analogy with boats. On a flat se~~e~~a, the boat move in a straight line. But if you add waves, the boat will move a bit up and down or left and right. Well, a plane does not move on the see but in the air. In fact, it "rests" on air thanks to the lift provided by the wings. If the air is still, the plane will fly flat. But if the air moves in "wave" (in fact, imagine the roll of the wave : that's what a turbulence is), the plane will bounce a bit. But a turbulence is not dangerous to aircrafts : they are designed to sustain turbulences way more powerfull that they will encounter. But, if you are standing in the plane while it get bounced, you may fall and injure yourself. So that's why you are asked to remain seated and to fasten your seatbelt !
Entropy is a thermodynamic quantity that measures the degree of disorder or randomness of a physical system. Is a thermodynamic quantity associated with the irreversibility of states in a physical system. It's like if you had a jar full of little balls, if you throw them on the ground, they will have a big level of "clutter" because that's the "way the universe goes", always increasing this "clutter". If you want these little balls to be rearranged you will have to give energy to the system (decrease the clutter level). In other words, to work in the opposite way of entropy, you have to give energy, otherwise the universe tends to mess everything up.
They normally have Velcro so that objects can be slapped on them and stay in place rather than float around and damage machinery or people.
One theory, that I was told, is that mentally handicapped might not have the brain signal that tells the muscles "STOP, MORE WILL HURT YOU". The other theory is that their adrenalin glands fire even when they're not supposed to. Both can explain the phenomenon.
Imagine two variables, pressure and temperature. The higher temperature, the more likely it is for you to have a gas at a given pressure. However, the higher pressure you have, the more likely it is for it to compress into a liquid/supercritical fluid, regardless of the temperature of the hydrogen. In the core of Jupiter, the temperature and pressure are at a point where you do have liquid hydrogen.  The main thing you have wrong is that you assume that all liquids have less energy than gasses. It is very possible for a liquid at high temperature and pressure to have more energy than a gas at a lower temperature and pressure.
In a system with no external forces (say, you're just holding your rod still and the fish is pulling the line under its own weight), the tension in the string is equal to the force the fish is pulling with. The drag setting can be adjusted to allow line out if the tension in the string is above a certain setting. In practice, tension in the string will be a bit higher because you will also be pulling the rod back/reeling it in. The tension in the string then is how hard you are pulling back plus how much the fish is pulling away. That's also why its so easy to snap your line if your drag is set too high; the reel will never let the line out and the sum of those forces will overcome the tension the line can withstand. Some extra tension stuff: That's all assuming the string is massless (which is kind of fine for fishing line), meaning tension is uniform throughout the string. In practice, if a rope or string has non-negligible mass the tension will vary based on the mass and how gravity is interacting with it. For example, if you had a hanging rope holding a weight at the end, tension at the end of the rope would just be equal to the weight at the end. In the middle, tension is the lower half the rope + the weight. At the top, its the weight of the rope and the weight in total. If that's accelerating, then there's even more tension added in. It gets even messier when the mass isn't uniformly distributed.
Several things * The chemical bonds between the atoms and/or molecules in the substance need to release energy when they are broken. Some types of bonds require you to *add* energy to break them, which is usually unhelpful in burning.@@@* The atoms or molecules in the substance should include one or more that want to combine with oxygen. Almost all burning you see is *something* in the process of combining with atmospheric oxygen.@@@* There should be enough surface area for enough of the substance to interact with enough oxygen. You can see this in dusts that are flammable even when the typical solid substance isn't, such as metals.@@@* Warmth also helps. Many substances become less flammable in very cold conditions. This is a problem for a lot of fuels, and additives to improve burning are common in colder areas.
Photons have no *rest* mass. That doesn't mean they don't have mass(-energy) in a relativistic sense. In relativity, mass and energy are two forms of the same thing (hereafter I'm going to use "energy" for simplicity, but "energy" in that sense is what creates gravity in relativity). You may be familiar with the equation E = mc^(2), but that's actually only for a particle at rest (which protons, of course, never are). The full formula is E^2 = (mc^(2))^2 + (pc)^(2), where *m* is the rest mass (if any), *c* is the speed of light, and *p* is the momentum. For a photon, the rest mass *m* is 0. But photons *do* have momentum (given by p = (planck's constant)/(wavelength)). And so the energy (and therefore, in a relativistic sense, mass) of a photon is not zero, and it interacts with gravity the same way everything else does. Or, if you prefer, the energy of a photon is of course not zero, and because energy and mass (in a gravitational sense) are equivalent, its gravitational "mass" is also not zero. In particular, you're about to get a lot of "because gravity is just curved space" responses that aren't telling the whole story. Photons don't just *feel* gravitational fields, they *generate* them themselves. That said, in practice, the mass-energy of a photon is so tiny as to be effectively negligible relative to just about any particle with rest mass: a photon of visible light, for example, has energy ~4 x 10^-19 J, while an electron has rest mass-energy of about 8 x 10^-14 J (that is, about 200,000 times larger). (In fact it gets worse, because mass-energy actually *isn't* the only thing that generates gravitational fields in relativity. The ultimate source of gravitational fields, the [stress-energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor), is also affected by the *movement* of mass-energy.)
Yes, usually it’s easiest to think of potential energy as displacement.  There is some physical displacement from a more stable configuration that is “holding” energy until it is released. Imagine a spring that you have compressed.  The metal atoms in the spring are contorted out of their preferred alignment and are experiencing electromagnetic stress trying to return them to to the correct and most stable configuration. Now imagine a bowling ball that you’ve carried to the top of Mount Everest.  It has been displaced by several thousand meters, pushed “higher” in the Earth’s gravitational well.  Toss it off the edge and it will immediately begin converting that energy to kinetic energy.  Set it down and electromagnetic repulsion in the rocks will resist this, but the potential to fall eventually still exists.
Your friend is either naive or intellectually dishonest, probably both. He thinks his ability to reason is more powerful than observed reality, and that's patently false. There are multiple infinities (see Georg Cantor and Set Theory), and the important facet here is that they can be categorized as either convergent or divergent. Cauchy provided us with a formula for determining whether a series converges or diverges. In conclusion: an infinite series can converge on a finite number. To trivialize this as "merely a theory" is overly reductive, that no mathematician or physicist would make of their entire respective fields.
The people who are saying here that we didn't understand it are 100% wrong. The people who made and tested nuclear weapons from the 1940s through the 1960s knew they would create toxic byproducts and that these toxic byproducts, if released in the air, would eventually find their ways into the ecosystem and food cycle and human bodies. They knew this from even before they tested the first bombs; it is an inevitable conclusion when you look at how nuclear bombs work (if they are splitting atoms, they are creating very radioactive byproducts, by definition).  So why did they do it? Because: a) They concluded, without a lot of evidence, that as long as they tested them a significant distance from people, by the time the radioactive toxins got into people's food supply they would be diluted enough to not be a measurable amount of harm. That does not mean that there was not harm. It just means that the level of harm was small enough that you couldn't really prove it, which for them was the same as saying there wasn't any harm to worry about. (One can agree or disagree with this. If you know something you do is statistically likely to kill thousands of people in the future, but you don't know who those people will be and no one will ever be able to prove that those deaths came from your actions, does that make you a murderer, or not? This is a much deeper question than it may at first appear, because we do _plenty_ of things today that we know are going to have negative impacts on people, but we are so removed from their direct consequences that we do not feel responsible, generally speaking.) There was _uncertainty_ about _exactly_ how toxic this kind of thing would be — in the face of that uncertainty, the people in charge of testing nuclear weapons tended to assume it _wouldn't be that bad_, whereas you or I might conclude, in hindsight, that there are other ways one could deal with that kind of uncertainty (e.g., assuming it might be bad until proven wrong).  b) They also concluded that the dangers of not having good knowledge of nuclear weapons was more dangerous than the dangers of the hazards from these kinds of tests. If your options are, "test lots of nuclear weapons" or "have nuclear war," then the harm from the former is probably less than the latter. That is how the people making nuclear weapons saw the options during the early Cold War, rightly or wrongly. (Not everyone else saw things in the same terms.) Both of these added up to the people in charge feeling like it was better to test, even if there were toxic outcomes, than not to test. Over time, not everybody agreed with this logic...! By the early 1960s, the amount of radiation in the atmosphere, and human bodies, from nuclear testing was enough that you could easily measure it (that does not mean that you could easily measure the health consequences — it is very easy to measure tiny amounts of radiation, it is much harder to prove that tiny amounts are dangerous). This raised enough concern that the US and Soviet Union, the two nations responsible for most nuclear tests, agreed to a treaty that meant they would only test nuclear weapons underground. This does not release radioactive toxins if done correctly. Some countries still tested in the atmosphere for a few years (France and China), because testing underground puts limits on how big your tests can be (it is hard to test very large nukes underground because that requires you to do extremely deep holes to test them in). But eventually they signed on as well. We now know, from careful studies in the years since the 1960s, that the atmospheric testing before that period affected the health of people living directly downwind of the tests ("downwinders"), and probably increased the cancer rate by a small amount of people living in the entire hemisphere of the test, but even a very tiny increase in the rate over a very large number of people adds up to large numbers (tens or hundreds of thousands of fatal cancers). Even establishing the link between the cancers of the downwinders and the specific tests is difficult to do epidemiologically; cancers don't come with a label that says what caused them, and lots of things can cause cancers, but if you look at groups of people you can compare their cancer rates to the general population and see a spike. It is very hard to establish the larger cancer possibilities of people living in the hemisphere, because even though it might be a large raw number of extra cancers (say, 100,000 or so over the entire 20th century), that is out of many millions of cancers caused for other reasons every year. So that is more theoretical.
Air pressure.  It's just wind really. When air pressure is low outside and it's high inside, the air rushes out of the window, because your door is open and the air is moving through a short gap so quickly (the gap between your window and the frame) it pulls air quickly, and since your door is open, the air from outside the room gets pulled along too, bringing your door with it. Then the pressure equalises a bit so your door closes. Rinse and repeat. I get it all the time when I leave my window and don't shut my door properly.
You'd travel until the universe died.  There is a bubble round us called the Hubble Volume in which the space right now is expanding away from us faster than light, so you'd never be able to leave it, so even with infinite time, you'd never reach the edge of the universe, if such a thing even exists.  You'd stay within the bounds of what we know as the Observable Universe.
It's not a single point. Gravity in orbit is almost as strong as it is on the ground. But they and the ship they're in are moving together, rather than the ship having to hold them up: if the ship suddenly vanished, the astronauts would continue in essentially the same orbit. Because you don't feel gravity (you instead feel the pressure from the weight you place on objects) this *feels* like weightlessness. As they slow down to drop out of orbit, they'll feel the deceleration of the ship. But except when the engines are firing, they and the ship are still moving together. It's not until they're in the atmosphere, and the ship is decelerating in a way they aren't (because air resistance is slowing the ship, but they're not directly feeling that air resistance), that they'll feel much sustained force. But the ship has to have some upward acceleration before they'll feel something you'd recognize as gravity. For the space shuttle, that would be late in its descent, when the air is thick enough to have its wings provide a significant amount of lift. For a rocket that lands on its own without gliding (not currently used for passenger applications), they'd feel it when the rocket fired its engines to slow down to land.
Answer- Light is energy that has photons but photons are massless particles so they have energy and momentum but no mass. Therefore light doesn’t have mass.
You have the option to have toast or cereal for breakfast, there are 2 alternate realities: - one where you eat toast. @@@- one where you eat cereal. Each of those realities will now hold its own timeline, which is the things that happen as a result of you eating toast or cereal. (You may drop the bowl when you fill it with milk causing you to have to clean it up which makes you late etc) the alternate timeline holds the past/present/future of each alternate reality, with the alternate reality being more of the ‘present’ result of what had happened in the timeline.
Its built to scale. Ba-dum-tish! Its calculated. Things like steel beams, girders, and structural components are easy to calculate as they have known volumes and densities. Same with any poured concrete. The designers know the dimensions involved and the density of the material. Basic math gives weight. A standard, non-custom material like sheet rock flooring has standard weight per unit area use. Glass for windows is easy to calculate up as well in the same weight per unit of area as well.. You don't need to be super precise in tracking a few ounces or lbs when dealing in thousands of tons.
Most metal-cutting waterjets include an abrasive in the water (basically, sandpaper grit). They’re not so much cutting the metal as sanding it away really quickly. Which is technically just bazillions of tiny cuts happening really fast.  Water jets run at *very* high pressure (think tens of thousands of psi). That, by itself, is higher than the yield strength of many softer materials and the water can cut those by itself by literally pushing material out of the way.
When you accelerate you would be pushed back into your seat, but for the majority of the flight path the spacecraft is not accelerating (that much) so the space craft is "falling" with the astronauts.  The engines are off for the majority of the time.
Three pieces: 1. There's nothing to slow them down, so once they get going they can just coast forever.  A spacecraft like Voyager hasn't had propulsion in decades, but is still rapidly flying away from the solar system. 2. Not all space propulsion systems are based on burning things.  Ultimately for a spacecraft propulsion system to work it needs to eject something with momentum.  To do that takes energy.  Combustion is convenient since you wind up with hot exhaust that has both momentum and energy, so it's a nicely packaged way of getting lots of thrust in space, but there are other systems that are better in other settings.  For example, one may use solar panels to generate electricity, then use that electricity to shoot some Xenon gas at *incredible* velocities.  This winds up being a lot more efficient, and oxygen is never needed. 3. The rockets that do use oxygen bring it along with them.  It's effectively just another fuel--you get one tank for oxygen (typically liquefied for the sake of space) and one tank that contains something like Kerosene or liquefied hydrogen.
Freud believed that each of us has an unconscious mind that is split into three different parts that develop at different times in childhood. The Ego is the part that is meant to mediate between the other two (Superego and Id) to prevent anxiety. It does so by being the voice of reason when it comes to your desires and behaviour - looking at expected consequences and making decisions based on them to find one that is acceptable to all parts of your mind. For example, if you found a wallet full of money, your Id would want to take it all and spend it while your Superego would want you to hand it in to the police - a conflict that could cause anxiety. The Ego would then step in and start asking questions like 'did anyone see me take the wallet' and 'how much money is there' and 'how badly do I need money' and similar questions, pushing your unconscious mind closer to the Id or Superego so you can make a decision. At other times, where the conflict isn't something that can be easily decided, the Ego makes use of other defences to reduce anxiety - things like repressing memories, transferring unacceptable feelings to acceptable targets, or seeing the same unacceptable desires in the people around you. Freud believed that these defence mechanisms could be a valuable glimpse into the workings of the unconscious minds of his patients.
Big metal bird not meant to slam into ground. Soft human inside not designed to withstand such forces.
Throw a rock into a pond.  Watch as the waves travel and eventually disperse as they run out of energy.  Sound is similar, you just can't see it.  Sound wave travel requires energy, and sound just like the water ripples it can't move infinitely through a surface because it runs out of energy as it travels.  Different surfaces suck more energy out of, like yelling into a pillow goes almost nowhere.  Has to do with how dense a surface is as to how quickly it will lose that energy.
We don't hear it but we can "guess" sounds by a lot of factors like composition activity temperature and generate kind of sound that u could hear if you were close to it.
It happens all the time because hydrogen is quite abundant and so is constantly being hit by photons that are flying around in space. The photon hits the hydrogen, excites an electron, the electron then deexcites and emits a photon that we then detect.
Things don't, in and of themselves, get cold when expanded. It turns out that most gases do under the conditions common here on Earth, but that's not a guarantee, and even on Earth it's not universal (hydrogen and helium actually warm when expanded at room temperature). The reasoning behind this cooling is [pretty complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_expansion) and has to do with the attractive and repulsive forces between atoms. Atoms repel one another at close range but attract at long range, so the energy of a gas changes based on how its density puts atoms closer together or further apart. If they're mostly in the repelling range to begin with, expanding the gas converts that repulsion to kinetic energy, and the gas warms. If they're mostly outside of that range, expanding the gas pulls the particles apart, which consumes energy and cools the gas. (For an ideal gas, these attractions and repulsions don't exist, and ideal gases neither heat nor cool when expanded. So this cooling is an example of how real gases aren't quite ideal gases, even though that's a good model under a lot of circumstances.) In practice, under normal conditions here on Earth, gases are mostly outside of the repulsion range, so expanding them cools them down.
Electric drive has no clutch or pop.  It can apply a lot of power with no tire slip.  It's less about the horsepower and more about the uniformity of the power from 0 to max RPM without the need for gears or shifts.
Time is an ability of the universe to be eventual, to change it's state and/or the state of anything it consists of.
Newton's second law says that a force F acting on an object of mass m will produce acceleration a Or, in other words, F = ma If you accept that the force of gravity is given by F = gm, and that force will cause an acceleration of ma, then you're basically saying that ma = gm or just that a = g In other words the mass term drops out and you're left with "gravity makes things accelerate at 9.81 m/s²"
It comes from the matter itself. Remember that E = mc^(2). So basically the mass of both particles is converted into pure energy.
Yes, it’s an enclosed system as long as you’re counting the ship.   The difficult part is radiating away the heat as you can’t use an air cooled radiator. Here’s how they actually do it on ISS: https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1
Nothing can move faster than the speed of light, but space is expanding, and the expansion "speed" of space isn't limited to the speed of light.  In the early moments of the big bang the universe expanded very fast allowing light to reach us because the space between the farthest edges of the observable universe where closer to us when the light left, but are now out further away so the light that is currently being generated there will never reach us.
Navigational officer of a large container vessel company here... Some of these other answers are pure speculation or straight wrong, sorry to say... There are many thing together that help them not just fall off. The most important are loading pattern, ISO container, twist lock and lashing. Loading pattern: we load the heaviest containers in the bottom of the hull and the top one is usually empty for various reasons. (Normally empty normal dry going to Asia and empty reefers going to Europe). Also taking ballast can help to bring down the center of gravity. The center of gravity is our target number and is calculated by advanced software with the information of the weight of the containers etc. The ISO container: Today we mainly sail with 20', 40', and 45' containers. There are some odd sizes out there, mainly 53' US rail and a wider EURO container but don't know much about them. All containers build to ISO standard have there corner cast in specific places and sizes. And a minimum strength. Twist locks: this is where the magic happens. Looking in hull, only 20' are stacked with a stacking cone (or hanging stacker, that can be put on from the pier) before locked with a 40' on the top. On deck, all are inter connected with both the container on top and below with twist locks. Here there different types, mainly a larger bottom base twist lock that also is stronger. All other uses normally manual, semi automatic or automatic twist lock. In the end all though work the same but you usually only have one type on a vessel. And the equipment belongs to the vessel. Lashing: Lashing rods are put in place on most ships in two layers of containers. For the modern megamax ships they usually have 3 layers of lashing applied. For many of the accident that have happened where it have been possible to investigate, either wrong or missing lashing (including any twist lock) or wrongly given weights from the sender making a heavy container on top, it will easier make the stack move and collapse. Maybe not so ELI5, but feel free to ask any follow up questions EDIT: To all of you kind strangers that have given me an award: THANK YOU... Especially the gold one
Technically, we don't, But the prevailing theories are that as an object speeds up, it requires more and more energy to continue accelerating. This is absolutely true on Earth and seems to hold true in vacuums, and the math on it says that in order to reach the speed of light for a massive object, an infinite amount of energy is required. Like most theoretical models that deal in infinities, there is always a chance that we are wrong. However, in the experiments that we have run on tiny particles in accelerators, we have never been able to reach the speed of light. We have gotten close, 99.999999998%, but every step closer requires a *lot* more energy. Based on that assertion, that infinite energy is required, we say that achieving faster than light travel, by means of pure acceleration, is impossible. That said, Star Trek/Futurama style spacetime warping could be possible, where the space in front of the object is compressed, allowing for a ship to accelerate slower than light, but achieve a farther distance, getting around that speed limit.
It's a formalization of "flow in = flow out", specifically in fluid dynamics. Fluid dynamics is notoriously difficult such that even proving a couple properties would win you a million dollar prize. Your friend is right in saying that engineering is hard. He's also a dick who gave the most difficult possible response.
Well, I'm not a physicist, but I know that the air around the puck causes friction, so it wouldn't go on forever.
Speed of fan blades has exceeded the speed at which your eyesight refreshes. So your eyes start processing the image moving either way, because it doesn’t have enough information to stay static with one direction.
It’s not.  Centripetal acceleration is v^2 / r . The force is *lower* the wider your turn is. Edit:  I have been downvoted?  Oh, are you implying a constant *angular* velocity (revolutions per second)? v = r θ v^2 / r = (r θ)^2 / r = r θ^2 So if you are driving a car around a curve, the centripetal force will be lower if you take a wider turn, but if you are on a merry go round, the centripetal force is larger on the outside edge.  The outer parts of the merry go round are moving much faster!
Ok, so “electromotive force” is sort of an outdated concept from back when we didn’t understand electricity, and thought it was some kind of liquid. It was thought to be the force that pushed the liquid through the wires.  Nowadays, we still use electromotive force for talking about circuits, not because it’s actually a force, but just from convention.  Electromotive force is the potential energy that a charged particle would lose from one side of a circuit to the other. It’s also known as Voltage. You measure the electromotive force (which again, isn’t a force), in units of energy per charge, so Volts, Joules/Coulomb, that kind of thing.  (There are some slight differences in implication between emf and voltage, but for most practical purposes, and for an explanation, they’re essentially the same) ___ The electromagnetic force, on the other hand, is the force that pushes magnets apart, or makes balloons pull your hair into the air when you rub them together. It’s the actual force (in Newtons, or Pounds if you don’t use metric for some dumb reason) that acts on magnets and electrically charged particles. Also, the electromagnetic force is what *causes* the electromotive force. A particle moving in the same direction as the electromagnetic force will lose potential energy, which means its voltage is changing. It’s experiencing an electromotive force.  **Edit:** *I incorrectly said that you measured voltage in joules, which is obviously wrong (you measure it in volts). Fixed that.*
Black holes. Neutron stars. They’re both basically massive atomic phenomena. But we don’t know enough about those objects to test what we don’t know. Basically, quantum mechanics is the most well-tested theory we have.
Imagine trying to dye the water in a squirting hose. All the dye you put in would just be the water on the end, the dye would never flow up the moving water. Fire is the same way as that.
If you close the window half way, half the sound energy will come into the soundproof room.  If you have an accurate sound meter, it would show this.  It doesn't seem "half as loud" you say?  Of course not.  Your brain is a completely non-linear processing system.  The whole point of hearing is to pick up the faint sounds that might warn you of danger.  Think of it like automatic gain control, where the amplifier turns up its gain so you can still hear the softer music.
Who is excited? Most people I've talked to think they are wasting the worlds ressources for some random leisure project
The Earth is always falling towards the sun, but it is also moving to the side very very quickly, so it is continuously missing the sun by fling past it to the side. this is how all gravitational orbits work.  If our planet were to lose its sideways momentum instantly, would would simply freefall into the sun, but the fact that we are moving to the side so quickly means we will (almost) never fall to the surface of the sun. [This illustration may help you understand the concept of an orbit, and how it keeps you from hitting the body you're orbiting](https://cdn.ricochet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/freefall.jpg). If you stand on a tall tower and fire a gun, the bullet will go forward, but will be pulled down by gravity and it will hit the Earth. If you fire a more powerful gun, the bullet moves faster, and so it travels further before being pulled down to the Earth. If you fire more and more powerful guns, eventually your bullet will go so fast that it will go around the curvature of the Earth before being pulled down to the surface.  The Earth is that bullet that is going so fast to the side that it is always missing the sun.
Light is made out of a wave in the electromagnetic field. By changing the frequency of the wave you also change the colour. It's the same as with sound, if the frequency increases, sound becomes higher and the colour of light moves towards blue, if the frequency decreases, sound becomes lower and the colour of the light moves towards red. The frequency of a wave motion is the amount of waves that happen per second.
Light rays travel at a fixed speed *in a vacuum*, in something like Earth's atmosphere they are slowed down a bit by interaction with matter. We know the speed of the light in a sort of backwards way. There is a speed limit imposed on reality that stems of Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity, this limit is 299,792,458 meters per second, which is a mouthful so they just call it "c". The problem is nothing with mass can actually reach this speed so c becomes a theoretical maximum speed limit that nothing can travel faster than. Since light has no mass it is capable of reaching c in a vacuum, therefore the speed of light is c. If you multiply c by 3,154,000 seconds (the number of seconds per year) you get a distance in meters which is a super big ugly number so we just shorten it to 1 light year.
Most of the effort on the atomic bomb project was making the fuel for the weapons. It is not normal uranium; you have to use gigantic factories to make it a purified amount of uranium-235, a rare isotope. This cost about 60% of the total labor and money spent on the project, and made enough material for a single bomb.  Yes, the design on the U-235 bomb was very simple. It's a little more difficult than you make it out to be — they wanted to be nearly 100% sure it would work, and that required a lot of research into _exactly_ the conditions that would cause a nuclear explosion, and making sure that their specific design would _exactly_ work as they expected it to. But it was not a complicated design and most of the work during the war was not about that. Because they weren't sure they could make enough U-235 in time to use in the war, they also tried to make another fuel, plutonium-239. This is an artificial element that needs to be created in a nuclear reactor. So they had to invent nuclear reactors and learn how they work, then scale them up large enough to produce enough Pu-239 to be useful. This cost about 20% of the total effort. While they did this, they discovered that Pu-239 cannot be used in a gun-type design like U-235 can; it will start to react too early and predetonate. So they then spent almost all of their time figuring out a much more complicated bomb design, the implosion design, that can work with Pu-239.  To correct a few things — the first weapons were all fission, not fusion. And it isn't slamming together powerfully that makes the reaction work. The reaction happens when these special fuels (called fissile material) are in the right conditions for a chain reaction to take place. They didn't want the fissile material to be in that position before they wanted the bombs to explode. So making a bomb design of this sort is essentially coming up with an engineering device that goes from "not going to react" to "going to react" very fast. So the gun-type bomb is taking two non-reactive amounts of U-235 and putting them together quickly so they react. The implosion bomb is taking a non-reactive amount of Pu-239 and using high explosives to increase its density so it becomes a reactive amount (density, mass, and geometry are three important parts — not the only ones — about what makes a given piece of fissile material react or not).  Anyway — 90% of the work for the Manhattan Project was making the special fuels. Only about 4% of the total expense and labor was involved in designing the bombs, by comparison. If you're asking, "why do we tell it as a story of bomb design, then, and not industrial production of fuels?" — that's largely because we like telling stories about clever scientists more than we like telling stories about the construction of gigantic factories.
The leaf blower is pushing the air into the sail, but there is an equal and opposite force pushing the leaf blower back. So if the leaf blower is attached to the boat the two forces will cancel each other out and you won’t move. Of course this does mean if the leaf blower isn’t attached to the boat (eg it’s being held by a guy on shore) it will work. A hot air balloon doesn’t blow air to generate a force, it uses a flame to heat up air instead. The hot air then naturally spreads out, becoming less dense, and will generate a buoyancy force on the balloon.
Wind chill and relative humidity are major factors in what the weather "feels" like. The more wind is blowing, the colder the air will feel, as it blows away the air that your body has warmed up, replacing it with cold air. A slight wind may feel brisk and refreshing, while a strong wind will feel much cooler than you expect the air to feel. The higher the relative humidity, the warmer the air feels, as it slows down your ability to sweat. Very wet air will feel cloying and oppressive.
Yes. Let's look at America's missile defense system... In your first line of defense, you have Aegis missile cruisers. These, if tactically and luckily positioned, may get a shot at a launching ballistic missile. Next, you have the developmental Ground Missile Defense (GMD). This is a large missile system that launches an intercept missile that will attempt to hit an incoming reentry vehicle during the sub-orbital phase. Next is the THAAD, an advanced hit to kill weapon system capable of striking a reentry vehicle during its reentry phase. Last us systems like the Patriot missile system. These may have a crack at individual warheads after they've separated, but it's pretty much a crap shoot at that point I think.
Your faucet has an aerator that mixes air bubbles with the water flow. The aerator can only pull and mix air when the water flow is high enough, adding bubbles to the water that scatter light, causing the water coming out to look white. Aerated water doesn't splash as much as pure water, uses less water, feels like a greater water flow.
What you're trying to formulate in words here is known as the ideal gas law: PV = nRT.   It's an idealised law, which means that various factors specific to each gas can skew this slightly. But to stick with ELI5 what this means is that the product of Pressure (P) and Volume (V) always equals the product of the amount of gas (n), the temperature (T) and a specific, fixed constant (R). This equation must always hold.   From this, you can read for example that if you want to increase pressure, there are three things you can do. You can add more gas, increasing n. You can add more temperature, increasing T. Or you can reduce the volume, decreasing V. Each of these can balance your equation so it still holds with your increased pressure. Indeed, as you said, if you want to increase pressure, keep the volume constant, and the amount of gas constant, you must increase temperature.
A dimension is simply a space with some minimum number of coordinates needed to specify an exact point within it. Take a line for example. A line is one dimensional because you only need one set of coordinates to specify a point on it. A flat square, like a piece of paper, is 2 dimensional because you need 2 coordinates to specify a point on it - you need to know how far left or right \*and\* how far up or down. A cube is 3 dimensional because you need to know 3 sets of coordinates: how far left or right, how far up or down, and how far front or back. Time is also a dimension because time in inexorably linked to space, and in order to know where something is, you also need to know where it is in a specific point in time. We know there are at least 3 spatial dimensions because we know we have 3 sets of coordinates we need to specify where something is: the x axis (left or right), the y axis (up or down), and the z axis (front or back). So there can't be fewer than 2 because we see that things have length, width, and height. There could be more, and in fact certain theories suggest that there may be many more "hidden" spatial dimensions that the 3 we observe, however there's no evidence to suggest that they actually exist and certainly no evidence to suggest that there are infinite dimensions, although it's possible to model infinite dimensions mathematically. As for why things like color or temperature are not dimensions, they're just properties of something, they don't tell you the coordinates of anything in a space.
If you’re thinking of sport climbing, someone rappelled down from the top of the cliff after scoping out a potential climbable line. They drilled and placed permanent anchors into the rock. After that, climbers can simply clip in quickdraws (two carabiners connected to a piece of nylon called a dogbone) as a sort of checkpoint system to place their rope into and protect them when they fall.
Metals have "loose" electrons in their outer layers, so they are very conductive, and the smallest voltage or electromagnetism can [get those electrons moving](https://o.quizlet.com/pUNp40EsHjg.unj29LmgPA.jpg), and electrons moving is what electricity is. So the effect where an electromagnetic field causes electricity to happen in all nearby metals is called [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction).  It's why radio works, why you can put an osciallting voltage in an antenna and all metals (antennas) within range will "feel" it (will have a matching oscillating current appear in them), and it's why transformers work. So your pulsar "pulses" electromagnetism, and very strongly.  Electronics is a bunch of chips and electronic components, all connected by metal wires, so your pulsar would cause extremely strong and random electricity in all the wires, thereby frying the chips and electronic components. You don't even need a pulsar; electronic devices are fried by a microwave oven, by being very close to a powerful transmitter radio antenna, by electromagnetic radiation flares from the Sun, etc.
Basically, a moving electric field (i.e., a moving electric charge in a conductor) creates a magnetic field. And a magnetic field would make electric charges in a conductor move. An electric charge always generates an electric field. We usually describe how a single moving charged particle would interact with stationary ones in our frame of reference, this is what allows us to talk about the magnetic field of a "moving" particle. But we could change the frame of reference to whatever else and the effect would remain the same, so its really the relative movement of the two charges that's important.
Water likes to stick to things (that's why it runs down your arm in the shower). Pour spouts are shaped so that the water can't grab on. If it doesn't have a spout, you have to turn the cup almost upside down to prevent it from holding on to the glass (like it does in the shower).
Magnetic bearings are very low friction, but not zero friction.  The moving magnetic field induces eddy currents in surrounding structures.  If you use electromagnets, like mag-lev trains, they need to be superconducting or you lose energy to resistance heating.
Gravity doesn't travel in the form of waves, gravity just is.  Changes in gravity propagate as gravitational waves If you just have a big star sitting still then just like a leaf in a still pond it doesn't generate ripples If you have two big objects orbiting each other then there's increased gravity on the line that runs through both of them and since they're rotating that ends up [creating a spiral of higher gravity](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Wavy.gif) that moves outwards at the speed of light As they get closer and orbit faster the frequency of the gravity waves we would measure increases until they get so close they merge up and become one and the gravitation waves stop forming.  [You can see that in this visualization of two blackholes orbiting and joining](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/8/85/Warped_Space_and_Time_Around_Colliding_Black_Holes_%28Courtesy_Caltech-MIT-LIGO_Laboratory%2C_produced_by_SXS_project%29.webm/Warped_Space_and_Time_Around_Colliding_Black_Holes_%28Courtesy_Caltech-MIT-LIGO_Laboratory%2C_produced_by_SXS_project%29.webm.480p.vp9.webm)  The waves are slow and moderately strong at the beginning but as they get closer they get higher frequency and stronger until the merge occurs People have been trying to find a graviton particle that carries gravity for decades and we're really no closer to it so its unlikely that gravity itself has a wavelength you can measure
General relativity is an applied theory of geometry, which as you know involves studying the properties of shapes and surfaces. The four-dimensional surface used in relativity is called spacetime, the curvature of this surface is used to make real-life predictions about the behaviour of gravity. However, just as your grade school science book about magnets does not imply that magnets shoot tiny arrows, GR does not imply that there is a real-life surface called spacetime on which we live that curves in the presence of mass/energy.   So no, spacetime is not displaced by matter because spacetime does not exist.
Mechanical advantage. While energy is conserved, force is not, so you can apply a small amount of force to the lever over a long distance of motion, and in return the car is moved a small distance by an immense force.
The ability to dissolve solutes basically depends on how quickly and efficiently solvent molecules can surround solute particles. As water, or other solvents, get warmer, their molecules have more energy to move around, so they can surround solute particles faster and more efficiently. It has more to do with particle movement than intermolecular space, as the volume of liquids does not change much with temperature.
ISS is absolutely not sitting still.  Due to relative velocity time dilation, ISS clocks would move more slowly than those on Earth.  There is a difference in clock speed due to gravity in the opposite direction but it’s outweighed by the velocity.
Usually poor traction on the road. The rain floats oil up onto the surface of the road. Then a car slides and hits a pole.  Alternatively if it's windy, a tree or branch could be blown down onto a wire.  The rain itself doesn't cause power outages, damage to the grid does.
It’s nothing. With a tiny bit of gas, some rocks and dust and radiation. You know how the earth’s atmosphere gets rarer and rarer the higher up you go? Well, at some point you just don’t encounter that many molecules of gas; because nothing is replacing that gas, all you get is vacuum.
Let's do the math! * The brightness of a star is proportional to 1/distance^(2). @@@* The Sun illuminates Earth with a total brightness of about 1.3 kW per square meter.@@@* A dilated healthy pupil has a diameter of about 8 mm. So looking directly at the sun with a dilated pupil would, aside from being very painful, allow about 270 milliwatts of power into your eye.@@@* If the Sun were 10 parsecs away, it would be about as bright as a dim star in the sky. So, to compute the amount of *power* entering the eye from a dim star: 270 mW / (10 parsec / current distance to sun)^2 = 6.4 x 10^-14 W. Then we just need to divide by the average energy of a photon of visible light, or about 4 x 10^-19 J. This gives us a ballpark estimate of about 160,000 photons (per second, since we were measuring energy per second a moment ago).  That's actually quite a long way above the threshold of vision, which can be stimulated by only a hundred or so - the limiting factor to seeing a star in the sky is the background light in the atmosphere, not your raw dark vision. A sealed room is much darker than the night sky. EDIT: Sorry, I was using raw sunlight in space - only about 1 kW/m^2 makes it to the ground. So my number's high by about 30%. But there are probably other sources of error here too.
The Universe is expanding, and it seems this expansion is accelerating.  That's an unexplained phenomenon, attributed to undefined things like "dark energy" or perhaps even "dark matter". These thermal findings are very interesting, as they might indicate another thing dark energy does, and from that somebody in the future might propose a theory which explains accelerating expansion and rising temperature. Until then, the answer's probably worth a Nobel Prize.
Diamonds aren't *particularly* heat resistant, certainly not more than a good steel compound. They start turning into vapor well below 1000°C. For temperature resistance, you usually want *tungsten*.
When your phone drops, the screen protector takes the brunt of the damage. I mean, it’s essentially the same principle as wearing a helmet. Does he believe in helmets?
The act of water transitioning from a liquid to a vapor is not what burns you. The hot water burns you. Boiling water is hot. It burns you. Cool it down a degree so it is no longer boiling and it burns about the same amount. The water that becomes a vapor is not hot. The energy required for a single molecule to leap from water into the air is not enough to damage your body. When water is hot enough that its molecules leap away with such vigor as to displace all surrounding air,  then it is enough to start damaging things.
You're right. An electrically resistive space heater is 100% efficient at the task of turning electricity into heat. (Even the little energy that gets turned into light reflects off of the walls and becomes heat, so it is truly 100% efficient) Small ones might have more trouble moving that heat around a room, but if they give the same power output, they are producing the same amount of heat.
It will run out of fuel, in several billion years. It doesn’t combust like gases you think of as fire on a stovetop, it’s undergoing nuclear fusion turning hydrogen into helium. But that hydrogen is being used up.  You’re just underestimating just how *ridiculously gigantic* the sun is, and how much fuel it still has left.
Very large nuclei tend to be extremely unstable: after their creation by smashing together smaller nuclei they may only persist for a very small fraction of a second before decaying into smaller nuclei
It's dynamically stable. A lean to a side makes the front wheel turn towards that side and sets the bike upright again. Make an experiment. Stand next to a stationary bike and hold it by the seat. Now lean it to sides and observe the handlebars. You will notice the effect immediately. In normal operation the handlebars turn by a tiny angle but that's enough to counter a tiny lean. It's like holding a stick upright on your finger. Whenever the stick starts falling you move your finger "under" the fall to keep it up. The bike does roughly the same when it's moving. When it isn't moving it falls, just like a stick does once you stop moving your hand.
About 200 years ago, Humphrey Davy investigated the basic idea of using electricity to create light. He showed that when electric current flowed through wires, the resistance caused them to heat up and give off light. He simply had a problem finding material that not only burned brightly and lasted many hours, but was also cheap.  @@@About 40 years before Edison created the carbon filament lightbulb (1879), Warren De La Rue solved the scientific challenges by using thin, high resistance filaments to achieve the brightness, and delayed burnout by making the bulbs out of high melting point metal sealed in a vacuum. However, he used expensive platinum for the filament, and the problems with creating a reliable vacuum made the process too expensive for common use.  @@@In 1878, Joseph Swan publicly demonstrated the first light based on carbon. The problem he faced was his use of thick filaments, which led to rapid burnout.  @@@Eddison was the first to use thin carbon filament with a better designed vacuum. Which is probably why he gets credited with creating the lightbulb.  @@@When Westinghouse won the bid to illuminate the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, they were unable to use Edison's patented design (the screw design), so Telsa made a new lightbulb base with a pair of nipples that twisted into place.
As you say when there is no load connected it is very easy to spin. This means you are doing very little work to turn it, so there is very little energy that needs to go anywhere. What little energy you do input is going to friction in the bearings, maybe a little joule heating from eddy currents.
There is resistance. And the lines do lose power. By using big cables and higher voltage (lower current for the same power), they can lose less power in the lines, but it's still a significant amount- about 5% of power generated in the US is lost in the transmission lines. That's why we have power plants all over the place instead of powering the world from a giant solar farm in the desert.
We're always looking back in time.  Light travels at 300 million meters a second.  This is a ridiculously quick speed.  But it's not instantaneous!  It still takes time. If you stand a meter and a half away from a mirror and look at yourself, the light reaching your eye is having to travel three meters to get there.  It goes from your body to the mirror, then back to your eye.  This means it takes about 10 nanoseconds (10 millionths of a second) or 0.00000001s to reach you.  So, you're actually looking at what you looked like 0.00000001s ago.  But, for all normal purposes, we can say this is instantaneous. Space is huge.  It's mind-blowingly huge.  Even at the blistering pace light travels at, it takes a whole 8 minutes for light from the Sun to reach us.  When you look at the Sun (don't do this), you're seeing light that left 8 minutes ago.  If the Sun spontaneously vanished, it'd be 8 minutes before we realised. And that's only the Sun, our own star.  The next star, Proxima Centauri, is so far away that it takes light 4 years to reach us.  So, when we point a telescope at it, or even our eyes, we are seeing light that left it 4 years ago.  We're literally seeing the past universe.  Because of how big the universe is, we invented a new length, the light year.  This is how far light can travel in a year, and it's about 6 million million miles. One of our nearest neighbouring galaxies is the Andromeda galaxy.  This is a whopping 2.5 million light years away.  That means when we point a telescope at it, we see the light that left it 2.5 million years ago, and has been traveling at 300 million meters per second ever since. This is what we mean when we say we're using telescopes to see in to the past.  The light has come so far that it's taken that long to reach us!
Its a process that happen without the object changing temperature, to do it they usually change pressure and volume. Its the law of boyle An example would be a ballon being inflated: it gains pressure and volume but the temperature remains the same.
How do you think all pieces are coming towards you? You literally see the  sparks flying in all directions.
a waterfall is just a river with a big drop in it.  They don't run out of water for the same reason rivers don't run out of water - there is sufficient water source upstream (typically snowmelt) to continually supply them.  But like any river, given the right conditions, they can run dry.
Yes the result would be the same. (Except the cool stream of air would "infiltrate", I.E. come through all cracks of your house) And if you have a good HVAC system then there will be both (potentially connected through a heat exchanger to recover heat in winter)
Mirrors actually do not flip reflections at all. Or rather, I suppose that you could argue that they flip front-to-back, since your image faces you, but they do not flip left and right. We *expect* them to flip left to right, since to face us a person would have to turn around (flipping left to right), but when they do not do this it confuses us.
>Does a constant downward motion affect the normal force you're perceiving. For example when you're in a lift after the initial acceleration, I can't tell if I'm feeling my "weight" differently.  @@@  @@@Your weight is not affected by your velocity (at whatever speed in whatever direction you're moving), only by acceleration or deceleration (and a couple other things like position within any given gravitational field and buoyancy, but that's not what you were asking, I guess).
Might as well be. Electro magnetism is a force in the universe along side the strong, weak, and gravity. We really don’t know why it works how it does. It just does. Anyone who can develop an answer would undoubtedly get a Nobel prize in physics and stupid amounts of money.
Gravity also pull out other stuff, like air, and they're a lot better at filling the space below the cloud than the cloud. Cloud is heavy, but the air below them - which they would displace if they fall - is even heavier. Unlike a feather, which is small so the amount of air it would displace is small, and the weight of the feather is enough to beat out the amount of air it will displace.
Photons are very special. They have no rest mass, and only exist at a very high speed, and have angular momentum even though they have no mass or width.  They are also their own anti-particle, as antimatter reactions produce photons that are identical to regular matter reaction photons.
I’m guessing you’re talking about shockwaves from explosions? A shockwave is basically a bunch of air molecules bumping into adjacent air molecules which carry the kinetic energy forward; like dominoes, where the person pushing the first domino is the explosion
True Vaccum is subjective term as matter and energy are interchangeable via E=mc2. You cant create a space with zero energy. Space itself has inherited energy in quantum mechanics.
We both measure the same speed; what appears different depending on your speed relative to the source is the frequency...if you're moving towards it, the frequency is shifted higher ("blue shift"), if you're moving away "red shift".  There's no such thing as a truly stationary observer, but I'm assuming you mean stationary \*relative to the source\*. The way that we both see the same speed of light is that time moves differently depending on your relative speed. We have a light source at A, an observer at B that's stationary relative to A, and we're moving towards A (so we have some speed relative to both A and B). Because we're moving relative to B, time moves more slowly for us than for B. When the math dust all settles, we measure exactly the same speed for light.
Yes,  if the resistance stays constant; increasing the voltage will pull more current. V/R=A  *V- volts,  R- Resistance (Ohms),  A- Amps (current)*
The first estimates were made by Eratosthenes, in about 240 bce.  Astronomical dates like midsummer and the solstice had been known for thousands of years. What Eratosthenes did was confirmed a rumour of a place where the midsummer sun perfectly illuminated the base of a well (the equator), then on the same date measured the length of shadow cast by a vertical pole at a location that was several hundred km away. By knowing the distance apart, and the fact that one place had vertical sun Ray paths, and the other Ray paths at an angle, he was able to use basic trigonometry to estimate the earth's diameter. His value is within measurement error of the true value.
Nuclear research. It's right there in their name.   They are most famous for creating the World Wide Web (not the internet) and for having the Large Hadron Collider which was used to confirm the existence of the Higgs Boson (the so called God Particle). So............ they do a lot of research.  This ranges from smashing particles together at tremendous speeds and energies to figuring out how to better organise the internet.
Wind is neither hot nor cold in itself, but when it breezes over a surface it creates low air pressure over the surface. Moisture on your skin evaporates faster in lower air pressure, which means that the fast moving molecules in the moisture break free from the liquid first and leave the slower moving molecules behind. All in all this lowers the average temperature of the moisture and thus your skin. Evaporation works even without wind, but with wind it is notably colder, hence why wind feels cold.
Your eyes perceive things which are flickering very fast as constant, if the flicker is below the [flicker fusion threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold) then we can't tell the flashes apart. Cameras on the other hand don't really have this, video tends to have exposure times of around 1/60th of a second which is more than enough to distinguish the flashes.
It's a chemical property, the temperature at wich the substance reacts with air. Though, any chemistry is just a special case of physics. Chemical reactions happen due to physical properties of electrons.
It shoots forward at its normal speed with respect to you. This means that with respect to ground, it's speed is that, plus the speed of the train, since it was already going moving at the speed of the train inside your gun.
Define fan, turbo pumps can take an enclosed space down to   about 10^-13 of an atmosphere.
Some pairs of characteristics of a particle or system cannot be both known with arbitrary precision simultaneously. This is not an engineering problem (i.e., we don't need new technology) or even a physics issue (i.e., we need a better representation of reality). It's more fundamental than that. @@@The most common example is position and speed of a particle. By definition, speed is how much position changes over time (or over some stretch of space). So if you want to know the speed of something with extreme precision, you will need to know the various positions of something over a short period of time. So when trying to determine speed, you have to include some incertitude on the position since it's changing. On the other hand, if you want to know the precise position, you will need to be exact about what instant in time you're talking about. Essentially unable to specify the speed. Speed is spread out in space and time, position is a point. You can't have both. If we accept some loss of precision, then we can find a trade-off that allows us to talk about both. For example, the particle is in that bit of space and goes to that speed for the time it's in it. @@@Another example is the position and frequency of a wave. A wave is by definition spread in space. A wave with a simple frequency is infinitely extending and had no position. You can add multiple frequencies together and their interference will produce a wave with a more limited spread. But the more you want precision on the position of the wave, the more frequencies you need to add. So against, you can't be precise about both at the same time. @@@Every time you end up with this sort of interaction it's an instance of the Heisenberg principle.
Light can be UV and polarized at the same time. They are not two different things, instead, those are labels for two different attributes which some light could have. Light is made of waving electric and magnetic fields, imagine it like the ripples after you drop a rock in a puddle or a waving string with high strength fields where the string is high and fields facing the opposite way where the string is low. In light, this field will wobble up and down as it travels.  The faster the wave goes up and down the higher its frequency is. It is this frequency which determines what colour light is. For example, red light has a lower frequency than blue light and radio waves, which are also a type of light, have a much lower frequency than even red light. So there are frequencies of light which humans cannot see and UV is an example of this. Violet light is the highest frequency which humans can see and UV (or ultra-violet) has a frequency a bit higher than violet, meaning that we just can't see it. So UV light just means that the light has a particular frequency, or speed of wobbling. Since light wobbles you can also talk about what direction it wobbles in, it could wobble up and down, or side to side, or somewhere in-between. The direction in which it is wobbling is called its polarization. Most light, like that from the Sun, is made up of a whole mix of directions which makes it unpolarized. So in contrast to that, when all the light is neatly wobbling in the same direction, it is called polarized light.
If they are narrow notch filter reflectors, you will see no spot on the blue wall.  If they are indoor house paint, you'll see a blue spot on the blue wall.
Sound is caused by vibrations in the air and entering our ears. Those vibrations can also move through a solid object like a wall and still vibrate the air enough for us to hear; you'll notice the difference in pitch from the change in how those vibrations move through the wall.
They don't. They don't even know if it's finite or infinite. The only thing we know is that it's much bigger than the observable one because we have vision on some stars that already left the observable universe and we can estimate their distance to us to be around 4 times the radius of the observable universe (no guarantee for that number, it's from memory)
Conscious observers don't really matter. Measurement is often a misleading word when it comes to quantum mechanics. The more appropriate word would be interaction. We can only measure things by having them interact. In the double slit experiment for example, you cannot set up a detector in one of the slits and detect a photon passing through without having the photon interact with the detector in some way, thereby causing decoherence of the wave.
It depends on how many "free moving" electrons are inside the material. When visible light hits any material, the electrons inside can absorb energy and re-emit it in a different direction.  Metals are shiny and opaque because of they contain free moving electrons that can move and respond to light. Glass on the other hand have electrons that are too tightly bound and light doesn't have the energy to interact with them and just passes through instead.
We don't know. Our current understanding is that _everything_ - all matter, all energy, even _space and time itself_ was created in the Big Bang event. The _how_ and the _why_ are mysteries to science.
We predicted them theoretically long long before we had any evidence they actually exist or could exist. Einstein’s theory of general relativity predicted that if something gets dense enough it will continue to collapse until even light can’t escape. Much later we discovered radio sources which looked like how we expected black holes to look
Any wave’s wavelength and frequency are related to each other by the speed. If two waves of the same length are moving at a different speed, the one that is moving faster is a higher frequency. Speed is distance over time, frequency is number of times the wave cycles per time unit, and wavelength is a distance.  Wavelength * frequency = speed The speed of the wave is fixed for electromagnetic radiation- the speed of light. It is light. So the wavelength defines the frequency. The larger the wavelength the lower the frequency. The higher the frequency the lower the wavelength. Red light = 700nm wavelength, or a frequency of 4.29*10^14hz. Tomato tomato. Wavelength = Speed/Frequency
Before this, the ideas were murky in physics about the relationship between matter and energy. They were seen as different things. This basically demonstrated that all things are energy. Then it puts down the conversion between the two in a way that explains nuclear fusion, fission, and radioactivity. In real world ways it explained radioactivity. It also explained why Mercury’s orbit didn’t act in Newtonian physics ways, leading to a fundamentally different understanding of the universe.
They can fly through the air; if the air is moving then the medium they're flying through is also moving and they have to compensate for that. Airplanes and boats in water also have to compensate for this movement too. It's a trigonometry 101 problem to calculate the direction and speed you need to go at, to counteract the speed and direction of the wind. Most of the time birds are strong enough to overcome the wind and still go where they want to; if the wind is too strong and they can't fly fast enough to counteract it, they just can't fly in those conditions.
It's generally about ratios, rather than absolute amounts, with the understanding that there would be no decay product in the initial formation of the rock. For example, for uranium-lead dating, we choose minerals whose formation rejects lead. That is, there will be no lead incorporated into the crystal as it forms. There might, however, be uranium. After it is formed, that uranium can then decay into lead, remaining part of the crystal. We can then look at the amount of lead. Knowing that the detected amount of lead was once uranium we can calculate how long it would have taken that uranium to decay into the amount of lead that we see.
The movement of ice crystals and other particles inside the stormclouds causes them to collide; upon collision some particles gain a positive charge and the other particles gain a negative charge. The positively charged ones are carried upwards and thus leaving the bottom of the cloud negatively charged, which is the side closest to the ground. The negatively charged bottom of the cloud repels negative charges in the ground. The ground close to the storm loses its negative charge and becomes positive. Thus, the bottom of the stormcloud has become negatively charged and the surface of the ground has become positively charged, and lightning jumps between the two in order to restore balance
Not at all. It's stronger in a small place but doesn't have the range to affect earth at all. Just like a small flame doesn't cause an ocean to heat up significantly despite being much much hotter than it. Scientifically: Magnetic field strength is a local variable. It says something about how strong the force is at that point, but doesn't say anything about the total energy of the field. Earths magnetic field is weak locally, but huge.
Assuming you mean 'analogy' (and this isn't specific to Physics), it's the idea that - in the absence of any real world data to go on - you make an argument that X is True by proving that: &#x200B; a) X is like Y is certain important ways. b) Y is True based on data we do have.  c) The ways that X is \*not\* like Y are unimportant to b).  d) Therefore X is True &#x200B; So you may say, for example, that you have not observed whether your apartment block would fall down if one kitchen unit set on fire. But you have examples of other apartment blocks that are of similar size, similar construction materials and methods, built to similar standards, which \*have\* had kitchen fires and not fallen over. Therefore you can reasonably deduce that your apartment block wouldn't fall over either, in the event of a kitchen fire.  &#x200B; The problem, really, is proving 'C'. A dog and a cat share a lot of similar characteristics, and in many situations their differences are irrelevant - neither can survive without oxygen, both require milk when young etc - but in other situations their differences will be very important, like their chances of survival when thrown out of a window (in a kitchen fire, perhaps). So the success of the argument really hinges on one's ability to explain why their differences won't impact the result.
Do you mean the one way speed of light?
The actual tuna won't however depending on how it is done ice from water in the surrounding environment may settle on the tuna adding to the overall mass.
They use a magnetic field to wiggle the magnetic parts of the pan, which heats it up. The stovetop itself only gets heated by the pan, so it cools down quickly when the pan is removed.
Energy comes in tons of different shapes, like kinetic energy, heat and light. And the way it interacts with matter depends on both the type of energy and the matter, because different kinds of matter respond differently to various forms of energy.
The Universe might be infinite, there is some debate on this due to observation.  We can only see the Visible Universe, and we are sure that the Universe is larger. The Universe expands by increasing the space between every single thing in the Universe.  Conceptually the space between an electron and its nucleus expands, but the electromagnetic forces shift the electron back into place.  This means that the emptiness "accumulates" in the space between stars and planets.
The L2 point is a semi-stable point in the sun-earth system, where the gravity of the earth and the sun combine to keep objects in the same relative position. You can be a little off the point and naturally orbit around it, though only in certain directions. It's semi-stable in the sense that it's stable in some directions but not in others. Imagine placing a marble on a saddle. If it rolls forwards or backwards the slope of the saddle will roll it back the way it came. The James Webb orbit is equivalent to the marble constantly rolling back and forward on a saddle. But if the marble ever rolls left or right of the saddle centre-line, the slope will quickly accelerate it away; it's unstable in that direction. In the same way the James Webb must carefully maintain its distance from the sun or it will escape from L2.  That's why it must use manoeuvring thrusters periodically and they'll eventually run out of fuel. The L4 and L5 points are actually stable; you could orbit those using little or no fuel but they're much farther away than L2.
Salt water is denser than fresh water. Since floating is a function of how much water your bodyweight displaces, in a denser fluid you'll displace less of it for a given weight and thus you'll float higher and easier.
The other people aren't really answering where the energy comes from. Basically, the instrument turns moving air that the musician is blowing out of their mouth, into vibrating air that we perceive as sound. And really, sound doesn't involve much energy. Like, an instrument might put out just 0.001 W of power in the form of sound. That's tiny, much less energy than the kinetic energy of the moving air you blow out of your mouth. So, by converting just some of the energy of the moving air into sound energy, you can make a loud sound.
AC works by taking the water out of the air. This makes it colder. It feels different because the air is more dry than the air outside. When there is lots of water vapors in the air it feels different to our skin. Water likes to stick to things.
Depends whether we are looking at the wave model or particle model of light. In the wave model, light is a series of ripples in the electromagnetic field - ripples caused by charged particles wiggling around. As it passes through a material with other charged particles (e.g. electrons), those ripples cause the particles to wiggle a bit. Those wiggling particles then cause their own ripples, which mess with the original ripples, resulting in the overall ripples travelling a bit slower (or a bit faster in some cases). In the particle model, light is a series of individual photons. Those photons enter the optically-denser medium and then leave it at the point opposite. But in between quantum mechanics happens, and the light travels through *every possible path* between the two points (the entry point and the exit point), with a particular phase associated with each. The time it takes the photon to exit is the (weighted by phase) average of the time it takes for each of the paths. So this will be slightly longer than the time it would have taken to go straight through.
[heres a good explination on how it works](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/02/26/how-did-the-universe-expand-to-46-billion-light-years-in-just-13-8-billion-years/) Basically, its a complex explanation that is hard to boil down to a simple statement. The universe doesn't expand at the speed of light, its faster, as it expanses, it pulls things further away from us. So, while no galaxy is older than the universe, it is further away in light years than the universe is old.
An explosion is a vigorous outward release of energy, which generates something called a *shock wave.* This shock wave pressurizes the air ahead of it, which then expands outward ahead of the shock wave. When this pressurized mass of air hits the human body, it can do all sorts of damage to our squishy insides, even if no shrapnel or debris actually hits us.
It matters, a LOT, if the students can see what the hall ahead of them is doing. In fluid mechanics terms, this is whether you’re going supersonic or subsonic.  When you can see what’s coming (subsonic) you react to what’s ahead of you. If the hallway is getting narrower then you speed up because there’s less hallway and if you slow down you’ll get run over by the people behind you. If it’s getting wider you slow down because there’s more room.  But…if you don’t know what’s coming you don’t have the option…that’s supersonic. If it gets narrower you slow down because you’re getting squeezed together and if it widens out you speed up because you have more directions you can go. What’s “upstream” can’t influence your actions because you can’t “see” it. The rule of thumb is that a convergence *always* pushes you towards Mach 1 (speed of sound, sonic flow). This is why you can’t do an infinitely converging nozzle…at some point the flow goes sonic and “chokes”…for the temperature and pressure of the incoming gas, you can’t get anymore through. If you make the hole smaller from there you just get less flow. So it’ll be subsonic or sonic at the narrowest point, then if you want to accelerate to supersonic past that you need to diverge.  All of the above assumes you aren’t adding/removing heat to the flow…if you do that (heated ducts, combustion in the duct, etc.) things get weirder.
In the same way that it takes time for water to come out of your hose and hit the ground. There's a constant stream of light coming out, but any individual bit of light, if you were to track it individually, would take 8 minutes to make it from the Sun to the Earth.
Consider a [Round-up amusement park ride](http://www.blenheimamusements.co.uk/upload/U21484_meteorite-fair-ride.jpg) If we look at it while its spinning you have very difference forces than when its still. The people are very clearly pushed against the wall by an outward force, this is the Centrifugal force.  It manifests because their inertia wants to keep them moving in a straight line but the wall catches them and pushes them inward.  Its a fictitious force when you look at a non-rotating reference frame, but in a rotating reference frame its real enough. The walls pushing back on people and keeping them from flying off into the distance is providing the centripetal force, its an inward force.  Its actually the normal force from the wall, but again for rotating reference frames looking at and talking about centripetal and centrifugal forces is more intuitive The Coriolis effect comes from something moving through the rotating frame being observed by an observer rotating with the reference frame.  If someone on the wall were to take a ball and throw it directly towards the center, the ball would take a curved path from their perspective because they have continued to move around the circle.  In practice, the ball left the rotating frame and entered an inertia reference frame and from the ball's perspective it traveled perfectly straight towards the center of the ride, it was the people on the rim who moved.
"Gone" and "Reduced to a fine paste of indistinguishable biological matter" mean effectively the same thing.  *A building fell on top of people*. If a slab of concrete lands on top of a body there might not BE much left to recover.
The big bang didn't happen in one spot, with everything expanding out from that one point.  It happened *everywhere*.  If you look 1 billion light years your left, the big bang happened over there. And of you look 1 billion light years to your right, the big bang happened over there too. And if you look right where you're standing, the big bang happened there too. It's kind of hard to explain, but the best guess we have right now is that space itself is infinite - like, if you traveled 14 billion years to the farthest galaxy you can see, and looked out in the same direction you were traveling, you would see more galaxies 14 billion light years away.  And if you traveled to those, you would see even more. So, imagine an infinite number line, from negative infinity to positive infinity.  What is the center of the line?  You might say zero, but in reality  *any* number on the number line is the center.   If you pick +100, there are infinite numbers less than 100, and infinite numbers greater than 100.  If you pick -1,000,000,000 there are infinite numbers less than negative one billion, and infinite numbers greater than negative one billion. @@@So, from any point in the universe, we can look on any direction and see the echo of the big bang - The Cosmic Microwave Background.  By measuring the expansion rate of the universe, we can figure out how much energy the CMB loses as it travels. And with some strong theoretical knowledge of recombination - the temperature at which electrons, protons, and neutrons form atoms - we can figure out the amount of time it took for the CMB to cool from recombination temperature to it's current temperature. All without being able to see beyond our own personal observable corner of the universe.
Boiling and freezing points are dependent on pressure. E.g. If you increase the pressure, you can increase the boiling point if water and therefore hest it to more than 100°C. In freezing a second effect can also be used: supercooling. Freezing needs nucleation sites to occur (that is small impurities or sharp edges that the first ice crystal can form on. If you have a perfectly homogeneous distilled water in a perfectly smooth container it won't freeze because of a lack of nucleation sites. You can then make this water go from liquid to ice almost instantly by introducing a nucleation site, e.g. by pouring it. Because it's colder than its freezing point, as soon as it gets a nucleation site it will freeze almost instantly
Food warms up by absorbing the heat. The more food put in the oven means more heat is needed. Only so much heat can be produced at certain temperatures as they vary in amounts of energy.
Yep it's matter and all matter is subject to gravity so eventually it will be drawn to the closest celestial object like Earth, the moon, Mars, etc.
Weight is the quantification of how much gravitational force gravity is putting on an object
It's not an ELI5 question, but the answer is yes, a little. Bathroom exhaust fans push air to the outside from the bathroom. Unless you're in a bomb shelter your house isn't perfectly sealed, so air will come in anywhere it can to replace what was blown out, from imperfectly sealed windows to pinhole leaks, anywhere in the house.
The blue ones are coated with an anti-reflective coating that helps with efficiency and absorption rate. The way they're made, by basically melting silicone crystals together, makes them less efficient than the black panels, but much much cheaper. They're called polycrystalline because they're made up of a bunch of tiny silicone crystals melted together. The black ones are monocrystalline, they're just one big perfectly aligned crystal. It's more efficient, so it doesn't need the anti-reflective coating, but it's a lot more expensive to make them.  Blue ones range from 13-17% efficiency, black ones are from 15-20%ish.
There is a compressor behind thet fridge that pushes together a gas in a set of tubes. When the gas is pushed together it gets hotter, but the same amount of gas still contains the same heat. The heat is just pushed together too. The tubes then goes a long way behind the back of the fridge, letting the air in the room pass by the now hot tubes. That air makes the tubes colder. About room temperature. After that, the gas is decompressed, so it gets pulled apart again. Since the hot part of the tubes took heat away from the gas, the gas is now way colder than room temperature.  That cold gas is led along the tubes to the part connected to the inside of the fridge. There, the gas gets warmer again from the heat inside the fridge, while the fridge gets colder. The warm gas then goes to the compressor again, and such it goes around and around.
The propane flame heats water and ammonia. Once it boils it goes to a chamber where it cools into a liquid and flows into another chamber that has hydrogen gas in it. The hydrogen combines with the ammonia and the chemical reaction pulls heat from inside the refrigerator. After the reaction the hydrogen separates and the ammonia returns to a gaseous state and recombines with the water and the process starts all over again.
Light is made of photons, which are electromagnetic waves. When an electric field changes a little bit, a magnetic field appears, and when a magnetic field changes a little, an electric field appears. So, when an electric field changes a little in a small region, a magnetic field appears around that region. Which means a magnetic field has changed, so an electric field appears outside of that region. Which means an electric field has changed and... Etc. So, in a way? The photon cannot do anything *except* move around away from its starting location (for example, when an electron drops from a high energy orbital around an atom or molecule to a low energy orbital). So light is very much like dropping a rock into a pond. The water goes down in the center, which pushes the water up around that region, which pulls the water down in the region around that. And the ripple spreads outward that way. A really good question is "why are electric and magnetic fields linked this way?" and that question is One Of The Big Unsolved Problems In Physics. We have a lot of competing models/ideas to answer this question, but we don't know which (if any) are correct. In order to rule out bad hypotheses, we smash particles together at high speed inside particle colliders and build massive neutrino detectors deep inside the earth: some of our ideas make predictions about what happens and how often, so if we run lots of experiments we can rule out the bad hypotheses.
You said it yourself. The universe is expanding but the amount of energy in it remains constant. Therefore it cools as it expands.
Two ways.  The first is satellite. GPS satellites all have atomic clocks in them. They're also fairly close to line of sight at the speed of light with only some minor variations in the speed of light over comparably short distances. This makes it extremely easy to compute the delay almost exactly using high precision timers and special receivers. Using the GPS system to distribute time from the US atomic clock we can get the variance between the different atomic clocks down to 10^-16 seconds. The other way we can do it is by direct optical cable. It's a medium that can have its length precisely calculated, the speed of light well known and controlled, and delay measured by the atomic clocks directly which can get the variance down to a few 10^-17 seconds.
Technique? I can't do it but you reverse the movement of walking forwards. The trick part of it is that you shift your weight to your front foot and then you slide your back foot lightly along the floor.  Now witha ton of practice this eventually looks smooth.
We mean 14 billion years in our (Earth’s) frame of reference.  As long as you specify where you’re talking about, relativity isn’t a problem.
Why would it require some continuous transfer of energy? The object simply exists and has this effect. The presence of the object warps spacetime and there is no reason this should require energy. After all, there is no work being done - why should energy be consumed?
The strings are trivially affected by gravity - the weightlessness wouldn’t have any noticeable effect. If you’re playing it inside a space station with an atmosphere it would sound about the same as it does on earth, but with likely shitty acoustics from the structure around you. If you were not rigidly tethered your body would rotate counter to the direction of your arm motion at any time, but total rotation should be negligible. A possible effect after a while could be if the string vibrations are pushing air away towards specific direction, then after a while you’d start to rotate counter to that direction. If you were playing outside without an atmosphere the strings don’t have anything to transfer vibrations to so would make no sound. They’d vibrate for longer, because they’re not losing energy to sound production. The energy from the vibration would eventually turn to heat as it gets damped by the violin and your holding it, and then radiated away.
A matter of wavelength. An efficient antenna has to be roughly the size of the wavelength it is meant to pick up, which is manageable for radio waves but would need to be microscopic for visible light (around 0.5 micrometers). Another way to look at that is that electromagnetic radiation behaves mostly like a wave at long wavelengths (low energy) and more and more like particles (photons) with shorter wavelengths (higher energy). Light is somewhere in-between and can show both behaviors: wave-like in interference experiments (see the numerous "double slit" experiments on Youtube) and particle-like with special detectors able to register individual photons.
Every time light hits something it gets absorbed a bit. Depending on the material, it might reflect and absorb different wavelengths differently. But eventually all light gets absorbed by something in that room, which happens very fast because of how fast light travels.
There's this concept called "entropy" that sort of means "chaos" in a weird way.  What it means is if we have some water dyed red and some water dyed blue, we have to do something special to put them in the same container and NOT mix the dyes. The red water is full of red particles, the blue water is full of blue particles. When they are both touching, it's like the universe cringes. The blue particles want to move where the red particles are, and the red particles want to move to where the blue particles are. Eventually, they're all equally spread out and you have purple water. So basically, unless we fight it, the system will go from orderly to chaos. That's entropy. This also happens with heat. If you put a flame under one side of a spoon, eventually the entire spoon will heat up to the same temperature. You can't have one side being hot and the other side being cold for long, Physics sees this as the same as the red and blue dye. Why? Well, all stuff is made out of particles. When something is warm, its particles are vibrating and moving pretty quickly. When it's cold, they move slowly. So when one side of the spoon's hot, those crazy fast particles keep bumping into the slow particles. That both makes the slow particles move a little faster *and* makes the fast particles lose some energy and move a little slower. That's why the spoon's temperature eventually evens out. That's entropy at work. The universe hates this kind of order, where there's a lot of heat in one place (the sun, Earth) and very little in another (space). It wants everything to be "chaotic", which means the same. So heat death applies the spoon experiment at a grand scale. The Earth is like the spoon. We lose heat to the universe. But the Sun is beating on us with energy and putting heat back into us. That's kind of chaotic, and the universe doesn't like it. One day, the sun will burn enough of its fuel to where it can't support its reactions anymore. Then it stops putting out heat. Then the Earth gets really cold, the same temperature as the space around us.  Imagine that happening across the universe. When every star burns out, there's no more heat being blasted out into space. A few millions of years after that, the temperature will equalize. That's heat-death. It's not a fun place to be for us.
We can't do that, there is an estimation of the minimum size but the size might be infinite. We only know of large the [Observable\_universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe) is and it is done by knowing how old the universe is and how it expands in size and you get a result of the current size of radius of 46.5 billion light-years. This is the part of the universe that is possible to observe from the earth. The size is the current size. What is today 46.5 billion light-years away was a lot closed when it emitted the light that reaches us now. The light from it only has traveled the age of the universe to us. So the light for the object 46.5 billion light-years away only has traveled 13.7 billion light-years. From the measurement of the flatness of the universe, you can come to the conclusion that it is at least 250 times the size of the observable universe. So it might be finite but it might also be infinite in size. So we do not know the size of the universe it is an open field of research where we have not reached a conclusion. It might be the case that it is impossible to know the size. So the best estimation is 250 times the observable universe to infinite size.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe#Size_and_regions
As the wind blows outside past the open window it causes a low pressure area based on the Venturi effect, that low pressure causes the air in the room to move to equalise the air pressure; The air moving in the room towards the window causes the door to swing.
Assuming that the boxes are all at the same level and the connecting pipes are all at the same level: 1. If every box has the same level of water, nothing happens.@@@2. If Box 2 has more water, it will lose water until the levels equalize.@@@3. If Box 1 and 3 have more water, they will lose water until the levels equalize.
With a gas or diesel engine the engine has to spin to provide any power at all to the wheels.  If you want more power then you can only add more fuel up to a point.  At some point getting more power out of an engine means you have to have the engine spin faster.  On the other hand, the faster the engine is spinning the more energy goes into just making the engine spin, and there's a limit on how fast you can get all of the countless moving parts to go through their motions.  For maximum efficiency you pretty much want the engine spinning as slow as possible. That gives a conundrum: how do you make it so that the engine can spin fast or slow when the wheels are spinning slow or fast?  The solution here is a transmission, which gives options for the ratio of the speed of the engine to the speed of the wheels.  Want lots of power while going slow? Low gears make it so the engine spins lots of times per rotation of the wheels.  Want efficient driving while going fast?  High gears are the ticket. Electric motors don't have that issue.  To get more power out of an electric motor you pump more electricity through it.  More power than that?  More electricity!  The speed that the motor is turning at has relatively little impact on how much energy you can make the motor output, so there's much less value in having a transmission to be able to choose the motor speed for a given vehicle speed.
Your body is roughly at 37C. Your body is also constantly generating heat. That heat has to go somewhere, and heat flows from hot to cold. Air is a poor conductor of heat. So having cooler air is fine, because that temperature difference helps to overcome air's poor heat conductivity (conductivity isn't the right word, but it's good enough for this concept). Water is a good conductor of heat. So having cooler water is bad, because it takes away heat too quickly. Your body has to work harder to make more heat to make up for it. Warmer water is good, because the smaller temperature difference makes up for water's high conductivity (again, conductivity isn't the right word). Warm air is bad because, being a poor conductor of heat, your body can't dump its heat fast enough. It has to sweat in order to do it, which is uncomfortable for you, or its temperature has to increase, which is both uncomfortable and dangerous. So cool air or warm water are comfortable to be in because they best match your body's rate of heat generation.
Well - we live on continents, not peninsulas... And yes you see different stars if you're south of the equator than you do if you're north of it.  You cannot see the Southern Cross from Maine and you can't see the Big Dipper from South Africa, for example. Stars that are more in alignment with our equator are visible from both hemispheres.
Can you explain that a bit more? I’m not really sure what you’re referring to
We could, but we have much more reliable ways to generate energy. Lightning is unpredictable and doesn't happen with anywhere near enough frequency to meet modern energy demands. We can generate a lot more electricity using the power plants we already have, and we can do so reliably enough that we can build a power grid on top of them without having to wait for the right weather.
The trampoline example is useful for demonstrating orbits, but it's kind of prone to overthinking ("then what's pulling the bowling ball down?"). The scenario I like better is if you imagine that you and I are standing 1 meter apart at the equator, and we each have a compass, and we're both going to walk north at the same speed. If the earth was flat, lines of longitude would be parallel, and every time I would look over at you you would be 1 m away. Because the earth is curved though, longitude lines converge at the north pole. This means very gradually we would find each other getting closer and closer together, even though we're both following our line north. Now if we didn't \*know\* the earth was curved, we would have to conclude that there's some attractive force between us that's pulling us together.  This is how spacetime is. Everything (even a beam of light) is following it's own "straight line" (geodesic) but the curve of those lines is what produces gravity, makes light rays bend, etc.
Air on Earth isn't at a constant pressure throughout the globe. There are 'pockets' of high pressure and low pressure areas. Wind is simply air moving from a high pressure area to a low pressure area. Differences in pressure are typically caused by differences in temperature. You can learn more [here](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind).
No, landing from jumping requires much more acceleration than just standing there.  You are going from moving at a speed to stopped in a very short distance (depending on the squishiness of your shoes).  That takes significant acceleration **plus** the regular 9.8 m/s^2 acceleration needed to keep you a constant distance from the core of the Earth.
This question is based on a common misconception. The Big Bang didn't happen in a specific location, it happened **everywhere**. The idea though is that all *locations* were much closer together in the early universe so all places had basically no distance from each other. As the universe expanded more distance rapidly came into existence; things weren't flying apart moving *through* space, the *space itself* was getting more distant from other locations. The universe even when very close and dense was still likely infinite in extent.
Ionizing means an electron can be broken off an atom. (The radiation gives the electron so much energy that it can get away from its atom) These electrons are what holds molecules together. So when you kick an electron out the molecule suddenly has some dangling end and will quickly try to find a new electron somewhere (I.E. react with whatever it can find) DNA is a very long and complex molecule. Damaging it in this way might completely destroy it (then the cell is basically dead) but there is also a chance that the damage isn't completely fatal but rather changes the encoded genes. That has some chance to cause the cell to go haywire (become cancer, when it's growth control and self destruct mechanism are both broken). As you see it's basically a freak accidant when that happens. So small amounts of radiation are quite save (and we're exposed to that 24/7). But the more radiation you're exposed to the higher the chance something breaks in a nasty way
Imagine a light ray emitted/reflected from a specific single point on an object. If your aperture is infinitely small, there's only one position that ray can ever end up after going through the aperture. Do this for all rays emitted from said object, and since there's only one place for each ray to end up, which is related to where it was emitted from, you get an exact replica of the observed object. If your aperture is bigger however, you could have two rays coming off the same single point on an object, leaving at slightly different angles yet still going through the aperture. Since that single point somehow gets represented in two places after passing through the aperture, blur happens.
500 million years of the evolution of complex life. We have evolved to move in 3 dimensions. Some organisms can plan for the future and therefore take into consideration the dimension of time. A 4th spacial dimension has no relevance or meaning to our lived existence (so far). That's if its even real. So not just humans but no animal could visualise it. Its nowhere in the coding of life as we know it
[Here's a helpful graphic of the proton-proton chain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Fusion_in_the_Sun.svg/700px-Fusion_in_the_Sun.svg.png) Assuming "hydrogen" here is referring to a single proton, and not Deuterium (H-2) or tritium (H-3) then smashing 3 together will get you to He-3. Generally two protons hit, now you have He-2(helium with no neutrons) which is super unstable so in less than 1 ns it shoots off a positron to turn a proton into a neutron and becomes Deuterium (H-2), then you smack a proton into the Deuterium to get He-3. Proton-proton interactions are incredibly rare and slow which is why the sun will last for billions of years and we try to cut to the chase and isolate Deuterium and Tritium for our reactors rather than slowly creating it as we go If you were to somehow smash all 3 together then you would very briefly end up with Lithium-3 but without any neutrons to hold it together it will fall apart extremely quickly.  Lithium-4 decays into He-3 in 9x10^-23 seconds and Lithium-3 lives even less time which makes Helium-3's 10^-9 second half life seem long by comparison
Because its actually a giant nuclear reaction happening instead of it simply burning away. It's converting lighter elements into heavier elements which releases light and heat and energy, because there is so much of the sun it can do this for a very long time.
This is an interesting question. We don't actually know in the sense of 'does anyone else experience visual sensations like anyone else?' The important thing is the subjective part. We can measure how e.g. cells in the eye react to colored light. But whether your red is the same as my red is something we just can't say. Your red could be my blue subjectively but there's no way to find this out because we would agree on everything but can't express or show our inner sensation in an independent way. It's not exactly eli5 but if you care about the topic of constructing reality please read up on constructivism which is a very different view on how we actually create reality in our heads.
In addition remember that campfires or bonfires tend to be in wide open spaces with no surfaces for the light to reflect off of. Indoor lights seem to “carry” more because they reflect off walls or ceilings, etc.  Even indoor fireplaces are designed to dissipate heat/light as quickly as possible to avoid overheating and combusting any nearby surfaces.
1. take a sheet of paper@@@2. cut out a strip along one of the longer sides. make it not too narrow, but not too wide. 3-4cm will suffice@@@3. turn one of the (short) edges around, and, without letting it go, glue the opposite end to it@@@4. take a pencil and start drawing a line along the long edge@@@5. you'll find yourself going back to the starting point despite not crossing any edges [some](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ImoL-fWsLmWpctchwzXA65ROKFcwbxeiliQt72Jicvi0vyo0g9HFrYNuQbdV8Vlp-cujcUr_rAbozRro6FYg8A) [pictures](http://www.indepthinfo.com/mathematics/images/mobius-strip.jpg) [to](https://darylchow.com/frontiers/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/images-6.jpeg) help illustrate what's going on and I wouldn't say it 'portrays' anything apart from being quite an interesting geometrical thingy in itself.
Apart from pupil dilatation mentioned by another commenter, it also has a lot to do with the reflection created on glass surfaces: if you're in a room at night and light up a lamp you'll notice that you can clearly see the reflection of the room on the window, but not what's outside. This is because the light coming from the lamp, which is reflected by the glass, is much more intense than that coming from outside, which in turn gets suppressed by the former.@@@The result is that your eye perceives only the reflected light, making it hard to see outside.
If there isn't too much of it, and it it's left alone, hot gas in outer space will disperse. The molecules just float further and further away, so the gas pressure falls toward zero. And the "gas laws" tell us that when the pressure falls, so does the temperature. So the gas cools off as this happens. You've got the right idea. (*edit:* ...Sort of. The temperature doesn't quite approach absolute zero when this happens. It approaches a temperature which is determined by the amount and frequency of radiation present in that area of space. Things can't really approach absolute zero unless they're also receiving zero radiation from their environment.) BUT, if there's enough gas, then the gravitational attraction of the gas starts to matter more, and overcomes the gas' tendency to spread out and disperse. Gravity pulls the gas into a smaller volume, raising its pressure - and its temperature. A gas giant planet like Jupiter or Saturn can be the result of this process, and once the gas is packed into a ball-shaped planet, then its pressure and internal temperature can be very high. If there's even more gas than that, it can get so hot inside that nuclear reactions start happening, and then you get a star instead of a planet, just like our Sun!
The button is irrelevant it's just a locking mechanism so the handbrake can't come undone when it's used as a parking brake. The main difference is that the foot brake pedals are designed not to lock up the wheels, and most modern cars will have anti lock braking systems. A handbrake isn't supposed to be used while you're driving, as such it isn't designed or engineered to prevent wheel lock (in fact keeping the wheels locked is specifically what's it's designed for) so it's easier to initiate a drift with a handbrake
Our eyes have three different kinds of cones, which are attuned to roughly "red", "green", and "blue" When you take a "purple" object, what you are seeing is an object that has absorbed a lot of the "green" light and is reflecting both "blue" and "red" This activates both your "Red" and "Blue" cones in the same spots, which your brain cobbles together into a sensation of "bluish red", which we call "purple"
They fall down, but they probably don't land exactly in the spot they were fired from because of the wind. They get blown off course and land somewhere else. @@@But, yes, there are cases of bullets fired into the air landing and hitting people, it's pretty dangerous. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebratory_gunfire#Notable_incidents
Because light =/= heat energy.  Metal is a conductor of heat energy (amongst other things).
To make a nuclear explosion you need an element that, upon absorbing one neutron (a subatomic particle) of any energy level, will split, releasing energy and more neutrons that can continue the reaction. It's not about just splitting "an" atom, it's creating a chain reaction so that you can split a trillion trillion atoms in a millisecond or so.  There are only a small number of types of atoms that meet the above criteria (the technical term for this is "fissile"), and of those, only two are "easy" to produce in bulk: uranium-235 (a specific type of uranium that can be separated from normal uranium in special facilities), and plutonium-239 (and artificial element that is made in nuclear reactors). Even these are not "easy" to make by any reasonable standard, but they are a lot easier than the other kind.  So there are real physical constraints on what the options are. Uranium-238, the most common form of uranium, cannot work in a bomb like this, because even though it _can_ be split by neutrons, it can only be split by high-energy neutrons, and the neutrons produced by splitting atoms are not high-enough energy to have a chain reaction in U-238. (This is why you have to separate the U-235 from the U-238.)
It... isn't. One of the most basic rules of the universe is that energy is (in general, on average) neither created nor destroyed. If you mean something like "why are there spinning things in electrical generators?" it's because of the way we convert one type of energy into another. You use one type of energy, like chemical power in gasoline or mechanical power from wind, to move a magnet past a conductor/vice versa. When you move a conductor through a magnetic field, it moves electrons in the conductor. When electrons are moving, we call it "electricity". (Remember: electricity is an action not a noun). The easiest way to move things that way, from an engineering point of view, is rotation. The other alternative would be something like the carriage return on a typewriter or something even more baroque, inefficient and harder to build and use. Does that help?
Physics is about the rules. Engineering is about how those rules can be used to build things. The two are of course very closely related, in the same way that (say) pure math and applied math, biology and medicine, or computer science and programming are, but they have different goals. As an example, physics gives you the tools to understand the strength of a metal, and why some metals are stronger than others. Engineering tells you how to use that strength to build a bridge that won't collapse.
When light hits a surface, parts of it bounces off (reflected). The remainder goes through (transmitted) or gets absorbed. Black colored objects absorb most of the visible wavelengths of light that don't get reflected. The portion that does get reflected can produce a glossy finish if the surface is very smooth or polished. You can sometimes purposely add a glossy finish by applying a separate coating layer. This top coat increases the reflection before the light hits the black paint to be absorbed.
Not enough hot glue Transformers are coils of wire around an iron core.  When you pass current through the coils they generate a magnetic field, since we pass alternating current through the coils they generate an alternating magnetic field Every time this field ramps up it physically squishes the iron core and pushes the wires away from it, and then switches to pulling the wires towards the core as the field flips.  For big power pole transformers this is tens of pounds of metal moving about and it rattles and generates that characteristic 50/60 Hz hum you hear from them For things like phone charges, they're using a much higher frequency(132 kHz is common) to let them use smaller transformers so you won't hear the sound created by each cycle, but you will hear the natural resonance of the core vibrating over time.  A big ol' dollop of hot glue is generally the solution to this problem and connects the core to the housing and damps out the vibrations quite well.
there's a concept in engineering called "slip" that measures the slow progression of fasteners, adhesives, and and other structural members as they slip away from their intended position due to everyday use, vibrations, thermal expansion / contraction, etc.  I remember studying it in school to understand how subway tiles eventually fall off the ceiling and walls.
Hi /u/akinkin! Physics is an inductive science. That is, knowledge is constructed through observation and experimentation, and the truth value of statements is determined by the question whether or not they agree with our observations.  Thus, the aim of physics is to look at the outside world and try to describe them in a formalized manner.  Therefore, Newton's laws of motion are not *derived* in a mathematical sense. Rather, they are *[axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)*. That is, these are statements which cannot be derived in a mathematical manner. Rather, they just assumed to be true as a jumping off point to formulate a theory. If it turns out that these axioms do not accurately describe and explain the behaviour of the outside world, they are reparied or discarded. In essence, Newton simply looked at the way objects behave and tried to guess the equations that accurately describe this behaviour. (Well that and by building on the observations and statements of previous thinkers)
Nothing. Space itself is expanding. The concept of space outside of space doesn't exist at least as far as modern understanding of physics goes. It is hard for us to understand since we can only see and measure the space we live in, just like it is hard for us to visualize 4 or more dimensions of space since we have only ever experienced 3.
Water Towers don't exist to distribute water.  They exist to maintain water pressure.  Why?  Because gravity doesn't cost anything. Think of a water tower as a bathtub. You fill the water up to the brim and then you open the drain.  Once you do this, the pipe connected to the drain is at 100% pressure.  Meaning the water in the tub is keeping the pipe completely pressurized....and it will stay that way until the tub is empty. The water tower works the same way except the drain is always open. When the water level gets low, the pump kicks on and it fills the water tower up faster than it's being drained out.  That way, gravity keeps the pipes pressurized.  That's why towers are up high instead of on the ground.  The extra height makes sure the reservoir is always up higher than any of the pipes in the area...thus maintaining pressure. It's simple energy conservation.   It costs municipalities far less to run a pump every so often to feed a water tower...than it would to run a pump 24/7/365 to keep the pipes fully pressurized
When the wind comes from the other side of the house, it flows over a house.  Since a house is not aerodynamic, it creates a lower pressure on the other side than the still air in the house and leakage from the other side.  Fluid, which air is, goes from high pressure to low pressure.  So since right after the house, its a very low pressure, it feels as wind is blowing thru the window to outside.
Sound is nothing but vibrations of a medium.  When you clap your hands together it causes the air to vibrate.  This vibration travels through the air to your ears where your brain interprets that vibration as sound.
Contrast is basically "light" or "no light." If you have light scattering into the no light areas then you have "light" and "some light" which is hopefully intuitively lower contrast. If all of the light scatters then you have "some light" and "some light" which is zero contrast and you have no picture.
Frequency is the number of waves that pass through a stationary location in one second. If your waves are moving faster, then obviously more will pass any given location in one second. If your waves move slower, fewer will pass through any given location in a second.  So frequency is proportional to wave speed.  Period is just the inverse of frequency. It’s the amount of time it takes for one wave to pass through a location. If the waves are moving faster, that will be less time. If the waves are moving slower, it’ll be more.  Period is inversely proportional to wave speed.
This might be an illustration best done in person.  Head outside with your kids.  You stand in place, slowly turning in circles while pointing.  Tell the kid(s) that their goal is to move so that you're always pointing at them.  Have them start close to you, where they'll just need to walk slowly to keep up.  Then, have them move further away, keep turning at the same pace, and watch as they have to run to keep up.
>A modern home is fairly air tight for heat efficiency sake.  @@@  @@@No. Homes generally have sufficient ventilation. Insulation of a home is mainly concerned with heat *radiation* and direct heat transfer via walls and windows, not with convection. The air in your house carries a ludicrously insignificant amount of heat energy, having it replaced throughout the day is therefore not really a concern. If you feel an actual *breeze* inside then obviously something has gone wrong, but that isn't required for sufficient ventilation. @@@  @@@Way before CO2 ever becomes a concern in your average dwelling air moisture will become a bigger problem if you never open the window and don't leave your room.
Black is the absence of colour whilst white is the accumulation of every colour, or atleast that is my understanding.
The switch for the wipers is built into the steering column not too far away from the explosive charge that expands the airbag. Often that gets broken and stuck in the on position after deployment.
Atoms also experience this. Larger atoms experience radioactive decay. Smaller atoms still experience decreasing entropy. They lose energy over time. The time scale is large and the energy loss is tiny so we do not observe it as easily as radioactive decay. Not ELI5 but Look up the second law of thermodynamics and the heat death of the universe.
The energy of two magnets repelling is put in when you put them next to eachother to begin with. Analogous to the energy of a spring being compressed - it just returns the energy you put into it. It doesn't last forever, as magnets do lose their magnetism over time, but since it does not consume energy to maintain their magnetic field there is no fundamental limit to how long it can last. As such a decent magnet could last thousands of years.
Its the rails, they literally vaporize over time Railguns and coil/gauss guns are often confused but distinctly different, so just to be clear what we're talking about here A coil gun has coils of wire that a strong current runs through to generate a strong magnetic field and launch a magnetic projectile A railgun has two conductive rails down the length that a conductive projectile/sled slide down. The current flows down on rail, across the projectile/sled, and back to the source.  Its this sliding that's a problem.  The projectile doesn't make great electrical contact with the rails which means an arc forms and eats away the rail the whole way down the barrel which greatly shortens their lifespan.  The Navy's experimental one was initially burning out the rails in 10s of shots, later on they said it lasted "400" shots but didn't say these were full power. The rails also generate significant magnetic fields as the current flows down them and they push away from each other so you need massive bolts to keep it from flying apart
So... you're half right. In general, the thinking "The larger the boat, the less affected it is by the waves" is correct on one standpoint, but it fails dramatically in others. So in short, Tiny boats, have little mass. The mass of the water moving and the momentum that it has will greatly overpower small boats, and even some ships. It's able to literally move mountains of moving steel in the water, lifting up even battleships and aircraft carriers when the seas are upset enough. Though as you become more massive, those waves become less of a nuisance... until you get to waves of a significant size. While we can always build a bigger ship, so too, can the ocean make a bigger wave. Ships so large that they would cross multiple Square Miles of ocean, for instance, would be greatly affected by shifting ocean tides and waves on many fronts. The construction genuis it would take to make a floating island sized object wouldn't just need to take water into account but specific gravity, air pressure, and even the temperature of the air and water to ensure the ocean did not claim this hypothetical island sized ship. The bigger you make it, the more forces work against it. And their application is not always even.
Take a slice of bread, butter it. Strap it, butter side up, to a cat. Now pick them up and drip them. It is a universal law that buttered toast will always land buttered side down when dropped, but another universal law is that cats will always land on their feet. Combining the two in such a way that dropping them prevents the universal law applying will obviously cause an anti-gravity effect as both laws struggle to remain true. Only dogs or an anime character running late for school can disrupt such a thing.
Traditionally it was in physics but the parts of physics associated with it simply drifted into engineering territory. The benefits of fluid flow, turbulence, etc modelling is absolutely priceless for basically all machinery, vehicles, medical equipment and implants, etc. It’s basically as relevant to every day life (and government interests…) as improvements in electronics. So a lot of research and development is done or contracted by engineering corporations (including big fat national defense budgets).  @@@Continuum mechanics does have some relevance for space. In fact it’s a critical puzzle piece in how our specific solar system even formed from spinning gas and dust. Recently there was discussion about whether the solar system has a shock wave, as the vacuum of space itself constitutes a weak continuum over that length scale.  But of course theorising about space is less applicable to every day life (and big sticks) and more just cool stuff for research entities to look at. And that’s kind of where physics is drifting towards… researching cool but more obscure stuff
They honestly can't. What heater are you referring to? They may be inefficient for some uses (i.e. getting heat to where it's desired), but you are correct that all that electricity is released as heat.
Your esophagus has muscular walls that push food toward the stomach via a process called "peristalsis"--think of the way an earthworm moves around despite having no limbs. So, while it might not be particularly comfortable to eat upside down, it's certainly possible.
It helps to separate dirt from air. Dust particles are heavier than air, and therefore can't keep up with the tight turns in the vortex. So instead of all the dust being stopped only by the filter, most of the dust collects on the outside walls, increasing the amount of dust you can suck up until the filter is clogged.
The toxins are created by bacteria.  The bacteria create the toxins as a by product of their internal processes with using food.  It's no more a violation of the first law of thermodynamics than you eating and pissing and shitting is.
You can.  But you need to carry that fuel, so there's far more mass to accelerate requiring even more fuel.  But in theory, if you had a sufficiently efficient engine or an outside fuel supply that could supply fuel as you accelerate, you can go pretty darn fast. Now at some point relativistic effects come into play whereby the faster you try to go, the more massive you become, requiring ever more fuel to eke out additional acceleration.  But that's not really ELI5 material.
Electrons are bound to their atomic nuclei reasonably well, like a tetherball on a bungee cord, but that cord isn't infinitely strong You can hit them with a bat(mid power photon) to give them some extra energy and stretch out the bungee cord, but the cord will pull them back in and they'll give off the extra energy as a twang(photon in this case) Gamma rays take this to more of an extreme.  You're not pulling on the tether ball or hitting it with a bat to give it some more energy, you're putting it on the barrel of a battleship gun and shooting it point blank.  The gamma ray hits the electron and it has sooooo much energy that it overwhelms any pull to the atomic nuclei and it just goes flying off away from the nuclei You can pull it off with wayyy lower energy levels too.  Ionizing radiation (generally UV-C through Xrays to Gamma rays) all have enough energy that when they hit an electron they can give it enough energy to break free from its nuclei and go flying off.  Most things below are just absorbed and then turned into kinetic energy (wobblier atoms) or given off as light (think things that glow under blacklights)
Plane engines don't work without oxigen to ignite the fuel and without air getting sucked through the turbines, so it can't do powered flight up in outer space. But yes, if a plane somehow can reach the correct speed at the correct height, like the ISS did, it would keep falling indefinitely (aka orbiting), like the ISS does. Every mass would. That's how all our satellites and the moon don't come crashing down. And how Earth itself doesn't crash into the sun.  Within the athmosphere, un-powered orbiting is not possible. The friction slows things down and so the whole trick with keeping your sideway speed to keep falling past the earth doesn't work. If you aren't lighter than air, you need some kind of force to keep you up. The ISS has no thrusters strong enough to keep itself afloat.
They don’t touch but they can still repel each other. In other words, one atom pushes against another which pushes against another and so on.
We do get more energy every day, but we don't *keep* it. We, and all things on earth, constantly radiate and lose the energy we get from the Sun, it's transient for us. In order to keep this energy, we would need to convert it into something more permanent. Plants are able to do this via photosynthesis. Sunlight + water makes more plant. The energy from the Sun that has hit the leaves is now stored inside the new plant that is growing. Additionally, we have solar power technology - that is solar energy panels that capture and store the energy from the Sun, by converting sunlight into electricity. Edit: The vast majority of the energy we get from the Sun heats our planet during the day, and then a lot of it is lost during the night. Our atmosphere shields us from completely losing all heat and freezing to death for a short while, until the Sun rises again the next day, and heats that side of the planet once more. This process repeats every day. If the Sun suddenly disappeared and we'd be stuck in a perpetual night, we'd quickly lose all the heat trapped by the atmosphere and Earth would freeze to the temperature of outer space, which is -455 degrees F (-270C). So good thing the Sun is still here and it rises again every day, heating us all up in the process!
1. Degradation is cumulative. So it's not the case that only X pieces fail in a given time period, but rather the number of failures is only going to increase, and it is already prohibitively expensive to send things into space.@@@2. Not everything can be fixed in space. It is a complex machine and they may simply not have the access or expertise to replace every single part there is.@@@3. Ultimately, if the end result is you've replaced the entire station, then why not exploit the advance of technology to replace the entire station with something better? Doing this would require diverting resources away from the current station and into a new one.
Imagine the flow of water as a number of individual water molecules. If the gap is large, you can fit more molecules through it at once, but if it is small, you can only fit a few through at once. Therefore, to maintain the same flow rate, you need more molecules to pass through  the gap in a given time frame, hence it moves faster.
For example, if you went on a journey and you plotted the journey on a map. That line is a representation of the journey through space (ie along the map) but if you think about it, it also represents where you were at different points in time. It is equally true to say that the line represents your motion through time (as you were only at one point on the line at any moment in time during the journey)  We also see this in a lot of graphs and diagrams. For example, if you plot the population of a country over the years, it is a representation of population as one moves through time. These are very natural notions of "moving" through time that we encounter in everyday life.  In physics, the equations are more complicated but it is actually not much different than the examples I gave above. There are some non-intuitive ideas that take hold in physics when it comes to massive objects (high gravity) and very high velocities. In everyday life, we tend to think of time as "absolute" - everyone keeps the same clock. Einstein's theory and experiments show that moving through space actually affects movement through time. Time is observer dependent. Although a deeper exploration requires some college physics.
Technically, everything in orbit is being pulled down by gravity right now - they just have enough lateral motion to go around instead of colliding with thr Earth. So, the thing that would cause something to fall out of orbit is slowing down. Stuff at the height of most satellites experience a tiny amount of drag from the very top of the atmosphere, and will eventually slow down and crash within a hundred years or a little more.  Stuff that's orbiting far above the atmosphere, like some satellites, or the Moon, can stay in orbit for billions of years without being disturbed.
Atoms move in a lot of different ways. They can vibrate, spin, and move from one place to another. All of this movement contributes to this idea of a substance being hot or cold. If a material is hot, that means the atoms that make it up are vibrating, rotating, or moving vaster than if it is cold. But this idea of "hot" and "cold" isn't really a physical thing. What I mean is this. Atoms can move (as described). Movement is energy. Thus a moving atom has more energy than a not-moving atom. And an atom that is moving faster has more energy than an atom that is moving slower. We call this energy "heat." And we can convert heat into temperature. But what makes 40 degrees F "cold" and 100 degrees F "hot"? If I just invented a brand new temperature system and told you something was 800 degrees in this system, you wouldn't know if it was "hot" or "cold." And that's because "hot" and "cold" are sensations your brain comes up with. Something that has temperature touches your body and there is a transfer of energy (heat) which triggers different neurons in your skin that then transmit electro-chemical signals to your brain which then creates a sensation of "hot" or "cold." Why go down this rabbit hole? Because understanding this is the key to understanding why a wind might feel cold or hot. Something *feels* cold or hot not *just* because of its actual temperature but how it affects your body's ability to get rid of heat. Remember that humans are warm blooded animals and are always generating heat and need a way to get rid of that heat or we'll overheat and die. And this is important because wind has more energy than still air and should have a higher temperature, but wind feels cooler to you than still air. Paradox? No, because in still air, the air near your body is warmed up by your body then doesn't go anywhere. Once the air near your skin reaches the same temperature as your skin, your body can't get rid of any more heat so you start to heat up. Thus you feel "warm." But in windy air, the air near your skin is constantly being blown away and replaced with new air allowing your body to continually shed its heat and transfer it to this new air. Thus you feel "cool." So even though windy air can be hotter than still air, whether you feel cold or hot is also about how quickly (or slowly) your body can shed the heat it is constantly generating.
CIPM, which is the organization responsible for maintaining the SI units, has been undergoing an effort to redefine the SI units in accordance with fundamental properties of the universe. The metre was originally defined based off the circumference of the Earth, which works fine on Earth but if we ever colonize other planets, we need an absolute standard. In 1983 the standard of the metre was defined as "the distance travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299 792 458 of a second." Basically, we know the speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s, and we know it doesn't change, so now we define the distance of 1 metre off of the speed of light.
Imagine wearing gloves. You can feel things even though you never touch them, because the glove mediates the force between your hand and the object. With a thick glove, small variations in the surface are imperceptible. Bigger variations, though, can be easily felt. Textures are just variations in the surface finish, as well as variations in how the surface shape reacts to force. So, with thin enough gloves, you should be able to feel any texture. The 'glove' of intermolecular forces is a few nanometers thick.
The windshield isn't perfectly flat, it's curved, like a glass holding water, or like a lens.  And like a glass holding water or a lens, this makes light bend, so the road appears to bend when you look through this part of the windshield.
Light travels at that speed because it's the limit, not the other way around. Anything with no mass, and in particular any information about events of any kind, is limited by that speed, and light is just one example of that limit (because photons, the particles of light, are massless). Other massless phenomena, like gravitational waves, travel at the same speed as light. A more proper term might be "speed of causality" or "conversion factor between length and time".
