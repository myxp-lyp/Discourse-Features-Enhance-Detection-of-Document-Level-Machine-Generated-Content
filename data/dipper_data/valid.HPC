Caffeine does not give you energy.  Not even a little. What it does is keep you from knowing that you are tired. You still are tired and you body still suffers the negative effects of it, but you can't feel it anymore. In addition if you drink too much caffeine too often, your body adjusts itself, so you only feel normal amounts of tired if you have caffeine in your system.  If you don't, like for example right after you wake up in the morning, you will find you are unable to fully awaken without caffeine.
As far as I know, there are only two specific instances where drinking alcohol is directly, as in *medically*, beneficial - 1. Alcohol withdrawal can be lethal. If a chronic alcohol goes cold turkey they can literally die from the lack of alcohol, so small doses of alcohol may be needed to safely wean a recovering alcoholic through withdrawal.@@@2. Ingestion of Methyl alcohol can be lethal, it's not the methyl alcohol itself but the compound the body digests it into that can kill you. If a someone has ingested toxic amounts of methyl alcohol they can ingest ethyl alcohol (the kind we normally drink), the body will focus on the ethyl alcohol and the methyl alcohol will just pass through the system and be excreted safely.
Tiny cracks and fractures form along the fold line. Light travelling through the different sections of plastic and air in these sections gets scattered by the different materials and appears as white.  @@@It's the same effect as when light is scattered by the tiny scratches and bumps in frosted glass or the water droplets in clouds.
Despite what some have said, when defining the surface area of a porous surface like activated charcoal, you absolutely do run into something directly akin to the coastline paradox. One measures the surface area of a porous surface by essentially covering it in molecules of a known size and shape. The amount of molecules needed to cover the surface tells you how much surface you have. The size of the molecules determines how small the corners and crevices are that the molecules can cover. That is, if you use a big molecule to measure a surface with a lot of very small crevices you will under estimate the total surface area.  There are materials with surface areas of several thousand square meters per gram of material. This is much larger surface than you would predict by simply counting up the surface of spheres.
There are small agitators on the inside of the pump nozzle that the liquid soap hits on the way out of the bottle!
oil, coal, and most ground based hydrocarbons are the result of decaying ocean life (or forests) that existed millions and millions of years ago, that lived and died before fungus came along and worked out how to break them down.  the soil and water at that time would have contained quite a lot of sulphur, phosphor and other gasses that would have been in the atmosphere. , which means that they would have been eaten by that plant life, and thus ended up in the coal/oil/gas. there will naturally be an outgassing of any gasses that accumulate inside the oil, and any water trapped in there will react with these gasses to produce things like sulphur oxide, sulphur hydroxide, and hydrogen sulfide (which is the one that REALLY smells of rotten eggs)..   when they dig down into a well of oil, they're going to naturally end up drilling through a relatively dense pocket of these gasses (which is why there's that "geiser" of oil you see in old west tales..  the pocket of oil is literally pressurised""..  and like any other liquid that's been locked up with pressurised gas, some of that gas is going to be contained within the liquid..  (think of a 2l bottle of soda, where the "soda" is crude oil, and the gas coming out of solution is natural gas/hydrogen sulphide etc)..  most oil wells at sea will have a large flare burning off to one side, which is where they pump any gasses that come out of the well..   there's no way to process them out at sea, and any carbon dioxide produced is a \*lot\* less damaging to the environment than pumping methane out into the atmosphere.  Now.   I'm not going to go into the politics of pollution in the US, nor what the US EPA can and cant dictate when it comes to oil well off gassing, but the gasses that come out of an oil well \*should\* be being filtered,  contained, and dealt with in a \*responsible\* way. .
Because they are polar molecules. The molecule is bent and has an unequal sharing of electrons. So while the molecule as a whole averages to neutral, there are locally positive and locally negative areas.
light thats been refracted into a rainbow is all still just visible light. It's just that different wavelengths have been sent in slightly different directions. None of those visible wavelengths are any more dangerous than all of them together in white light are.
Part of the burning is the from hydration of the water in your skin anyway. To minimise damage you just want to stop all burning as quickly as possible (chemical & thermal).  If you were to pipette water onto the sulphuric acid on your skin then yes you may make the thermal burns worse. However if you douse the area such that the ratio of water to acid is high, then the benefit of washing away the acid, combined with cooling from the water will almost certainly be better. Water is extremely good at adsorbing heat.
The salt isn’t meting the ice. It’s actually lowering the freezing point of water. Technically if the temperature drops low enough, saltwater will freeze.
The stickiness is stuck to the tape. At first. Over time, it becomes stuck to other things instead, like a paper, or the wall, or bits of the air or humidity or dust.
Ultra-violet light can ionize the DNA in cells and break it down, disrupting cell function and eventually killing the bacteria. It also creates small amounts of ozone which can do serious damage to cells. It's used for cleaning because it's a fairly non-invasive way of disinfecting surfaces that doesn't require any toxic or damaging chemicals.
Alcohol is poisonous. Filling your body with poison is generally not a good thing, so your liver has evolved to be able to convert that poisonous alcohol into harmless acetic acid (which can even be further broken down into carbon dioxide, releasing some useful energy in the process - this is why alcohol has calories). Unfortunately, there's an intermediate step here. Alcohol cannot be directly converted to acetic acid, it first has to be converted into something called acetaldehyde, which is *way* more poisonous than alcohol is.  The steps your body goes through after drinking alcohol depends on the quantity of alcohol and acetaldehyde in your blood. When you're drinking, you have a lot of alcohol and not much acetaldehyde, so you get to experience the stuff alcohol does - the fun of your brain not working properly. During a hangover, most of that alcohol is now acetaldehyde, so alcohol is no longer inhibiting your brain's ability to tell itself not to do stuff (including not to feel pain), and instead you get a whole bunch of acetaldehyde toxicity, combined with the pains of dehydration, sleep deprivation and a range of other things that all individually suck and are all going on at the same time.
Cutting onions releases a gas that, when combined with the water on the surface of your eye, creates an acid that burns.
What you are seeing is the sum of all colour pigments in the liquid.  @@@Coffee is a dark shade of brown, almost black.  Milk is white.  Add a little milk and the pigments combine to make a new colour that is a lighter shade of brown than the original dark brown/black.
Electricity passing through water doesn't make the water itself harmful, it is the electricity that is the danger. Our bodies use charge gradients between cells to transfer signals through nerves, and electricity is a massive charge gradient. The result is that when electricity passes through the human body it triggers all kinds of signals at once; muscles contract all at once without stopping, senses go haywire, etc. This can be extremely dangerous for things that we need to operate constantly, such as our heart. Beyond that, electricity experiences resistance in all substances (except superconductors) and that resistance results in heat. Sufficient electricity passing through the body can produce enough heat to damage tissue through actually cooking it, denaturing proteins and chemically altering it permanently. Essentially it is a penetrating burn wherever the path of electricity flowed. So electricity has the potential to be really bad for the human body, but why is it so dangerous with water? This is because normally electricity is confined to things like wires, and as long as you don't touch a hot wire you should be good. Water can conduct electricity though (technically it needs some trace salts or similar ions to be a good conductor, but that is usually the case unless it is highly distilled water). This turns a dangerous wire into a pool of dangerous fluid that covers a much larger area and can flow around in unexpected ways. It is also often not obvious the electrified water is dangerous since it just looks like normal water, but touching it could result in lethal path for electricity to move to ground though your body. And yes, if the electricity is removed then the water is immediately safe to touch (as long as it isn't hot). Think about if you cut the electricity to a wire, the wire is immediately safe to touch because it wasn't somehow altered into a harmful material while it was conducting electricity.
When we say “touch” we usually mean “electron clouds run into each other”. Just because they’re not literally touching doesn’t mean they can’t interact. If the interaction has high attraction, we call that “sticky”.  Actually touching is bad. That’s nuclear fusion.
The simplest answer is when you bake cookies, you're just not heating them anywhere near hot enough to melt anything. Cookie dough is a giant collection of biochemicals (sugars and sugar polymers, proteins, lipids, etc.), and if you just kept cranking the temperature higher and higher, those large molecules would start breaking apart into smaller and smaller molecules until the chemical composition was changed so much that what you have is no longer cookie dough. At a high enough temperature you would drive almost everything except a lump of carbon, which does not melt at *any* temperature at normal atmospheric pressure. You can't melt cookie dough because it would stop being cookie dough before you reached the melting points of its ingredients.
The value of oil is in its energy density.  We can simply set light to it and release lots of energy.  But to get energy dense molecules you have to put energy into the system.  With oil this was done firstly by the plankton that died to form the carbon rich sediment,  and then by geological processes over millions of years that subjected that sediment to high temperatures and pressure for long periods of time.  If you want to do that artificially you have to put all that energy in.  And you have to put more energy in than you will get back out.  So it's a pointless process.
Many dishwashers dry dishes by heating up coils inside the dishwasher. These coils can release enough heat to warp certain plastics or damage the finish on cups or dishes. Usually these coils are on the bottom of the dishwasher so the top rack gets less heat. That is why some kitchenware are "top rack only".
The bubbles you see in boiling water isn't air, it's just water that has become hot enough to turn into steam.
All carbonation is just gas (usually C02) dissolved in liquid. It dissolves better in colder liquids, and under higher pressures. If you do anything to knock that gas out of suspension the gas will form bubbles and float out of the liquid. If you shake a drink the co2 forms bubbles and float out. In fact many wine makers use a degassing tool (think like the paint mixer you’d attach to a drill) to knock co2 bubbles out of wine between fermentation and bottling.
Approximately yes. If you look into it more precisely, there will be tiny variations due to 2 phenomena: * nucleon bonding energy: Following E=mc^2, if something loses energy it also loses mass. If sodium's nucleus is a bit more stable (i.e. lower energy) than carbon (the reference), then it will be a bit lighter than exactly 23. If it's more unstable, it will be heavier.@@@* the natural isotope distribution: The most abundant sodium "version" might be the one with 23 amu, but there may be smaller amounts of 22- or 24 amu sodium (with extra or less neutrons). That also throws the exact number off since you have to take the weighted average then. In reality, sodium nuclei *are* a bit more stable than C nuclei (stability generally goes up from H to Fe, and from there onward it goes down again), and also sodium is a monoisotopic element, i.e. there's only 1 relevant isotope on Earth. So the second point is moot for sodium, and going by the first one the molar mass should  be a tiny bit below 23. It turns out to be **22.98976928(2)**.

It depends on the way they freeze!   If you make ice cubes in a tray in your fridge, the cold touches the outer water first. This will freeze first. As water gets colder, it can hold less gas - some of the air in the water will form bubbles. Freezing outside in, these bubbles get trapped in the ice, making it cloudy.   By comparison, an industrial ice cube maker usually uses cold 'fingers' around which water flows, meaning that the ice cubes freeze from the inside out - any air that would get trapped, gets carried away with the flow of water, leaving a nice and transparent cube of ice. This is where restaurant ice gets those holes in it, too.   Edit: I've done some more research and found out that while the above does hold true, the impurities, minerals and such, in water also play a big part. As ice freezes, it crystallises, and the crystal structures tend to push those impurities out. Freeze outside in, they get pushed towards and bunch up in the middle - freeze inside out, and they escape with the flowing water.
When you digest stuff, it gets broken down in yur intestine. But, the little molecules still have to be brought through the cells in your intestine to get into the blood. The molecules have to essentially fit through channels to do so. If the molecule doesn't fit, you can't absorb it. Some no calorie sweeteners might be close enough in shape to the real thing to taste sweet, but too different to be absorbed through those channels. Others are really good at activating your taste buds, so that tiny, tiny amounts taste as sweet as lots of real sugar. But there is so little in the food or drink, that it is basically the same as if you didn't eat any calories
your entire body works very hard to try to stay balanced, and the process is more complicated than simply throwing out the bad and keeping the good.   you can think of it as a puzzle where you want everything as even as possible,  but you arent allowed to have any empty slots.  if you want to throw out sodium you need to fill the spot the sodium is in with something else similar enough to fit there.  if you want more calcium you need to try to throw out something in a calcium shaped spot.   while drinking water after ingesting too much sodium helps with short term symptoms such as dehydration or cramps,  it usually does not supply the necessary pieces to fill in the sodium spots when sodium is thrown away. those still need to be taken from elsewhere.   so a large excess of sodium long term heavily taxes the body by causing a loss of other similar nutrients that cant be absorbed since there are no open spots for them, heavily taxes organs like the kidney that are trying to move sodium everyday when it doesnt have enough puzzle pieces to keep up with the consupmtion, and can eventually cause even further unbalances as other puzzle pieces have to be reshuffled to attempt to balance with the sodium.   p.s.  the reason water retains with sodium  is because your body is struggling to find pieces to trade out with the sodium and must keep it.  the water is kept as well to prevent those immediate issues of sodium like dehydration and cramps etc.  but doesnt fix the core issue.   ***tldr having a very high amount of sodium is like playing a game of tetris with a ton of one piece and hardly any of the others.  your body tries to adapt but eventually you end up with more and more pieces on the board that are sodium and no way to get rid of them.  while water can help short term with sodium consumption it doesnt give your body the needed pieces to clear a board full of sodium, and instead fills the board up even more as a piece that glues itself to sodium.***
White gold is mixed with white metals like nickel, while yellow gold is mixed with yellow metals like copper.
Fire needs three things. Heat, fuel and oxygen.  You dont have random fuel in air, and the heat diminishes quickly at a distance from the flame.  So while oxygen is plentiful in the atmosphere, the other two, thankfully, are not.
In covalent bonding, atoms share pairs of electrons. They are held together because they're both grabbing onto the same electrons. In ionic bonding, there's no sharing. One atom just straight up steals electrons from the other. That makes one atom negatively-charged and one atom positively-charged. And so they're held together by the electrostatic force that makes negative charge attracted to positive charge, as if the two ions were one giant proton and one giant electron. Molecular compounds are, esentially, self-contained compounds - ones where the individual molecules are discrete, and not physically connected to other molecules. This in contrast to a *macro*molecular/matrix compound, which is like one giant molecule with no clear boundary because everything is connected to everything else. For example, silica, which is what quartz is made of, has the formula SiO2 - but it's not like a quartz crystal is a bunch of individual SiO2 molecules just huddled together. Instead, it's a huge web of Si and O atoms, where every Si connects to 4 O, and each of those O connects to 2 Si, and each of *those* Si connects to 4 more O, and each of *those* O connect to 2 more Si, and on and on and on. So the formula isn't really expressing that there are discrete, individual SiO2 molecules - it's just saying that, taken all together, there are twice as many O atoms as Si. Molecular compounds are the opposite of that. O2, for instance, is molecular. Oxygen doesn't form huge rings where every oxygen atom is connected to two other oxygen atoms. You *do* in that case just have a bunch of individual O2 molecules. Ionic compounds are generally macromolecular.
When liquid water hits 100 C (212 F), it stops getting hotter.@@@If you add more energy into the liquid water, that energy goes towards turning the liquid water into a gas rather than making the water hotter.     The chemical reactions involved in frying tend to happen at temperatures above 100 C.  @@@  @@@For most oils the boiling temperatures is well above 100 C.  @@@Though you rarely reach it. Most of the bubbling in oil is water that was mixed with the food boiling.
Radiation is normally Alpha, Beta and Gamma radiation, a positron is something different but is related to particle physics. Which are basically a Helium atom (without electrons), an Electron and an Electromagnetic wave (like light but more dangerous).
Better experience. When some things like bread are microwaved they go a bit chewy due to the heat, meanwhile when some things get baked in an oven they lose a lot of moisture and might become too crispy. Both methods work but which gives better results depends on the nature of what you are heating.
It’s not recorded anywhere since these first events happened in prehistory. What *probably* happened was someone threw some metal-rich ores into their campfire rocks, and then proceeded to make a pointlessly huge and hot bonfire as all manly dorks do. The way-too-hot fire melts the ore and the next morning they find purified copper in the ashes.
Cooking oil vaporizes out of open pans and settles back down on nearby surfaces mixing with dust that's already there.
Freezing a huge amount of water requires a huge amount of energy. That makes it incredibly expensive. Getting fresh water isn't a technical problem, it's an economic problem. Most areas threatened by loss of fresh water supplies don't have the money to build massive desalination plants.
Certain vitamins and other nutrients can certainly be reduced by the cooking process, but the amount lost depends on the cooking process, and healthy foods are still healthy because even after cooking, they still contain plenty of vitamins and other nutrients - enough that your body needs assuming that you eat a balanced diet. Some cooking processes can actually make it easier for your body too extract the nutrients. As for things like meat, yes, some nutrients can be lost in the cooking process, but again, it really varies based on the specific cooking process, and you're not losing all of the nutrients. Regardless, we cook meat anyway because it's generally not safe to eat raw.
I'm not sure I understand the question, but heating up and cooling down are basically the same thing. The hot water has high thermal energy, the cold water has low thermal energy. When you mix them they split the difference. The cold water is heating up and the warm water is cooling down until the energy is distributed evenly. For half the water to warm up faster than the other half cools down would violate the first law of thermodynamics.
Drugs cost millions, sometimes billions of dollars in research and development. Most times, drugs are under a patent when they come to market, meaning only the company that owns the patent can produce and sell it until the patent expires. This is why we have generic vs name brand drugs (genetics are made after the patent expires).  During the time when it's under patent, that cost is often passed down into the price of the drug. For example, I used to be on a medication that was under patent and had no generic. It would have been $9,000 / month without insurance. They lost their patent 2 years ago and I was able to get the generic for $150 / month (without insurance).
Water can evaporate, even when it's below boiling. What happens is that some molecules in the water are much faster than others, and these really fast molecules can actually manage to escape the water even if the average temperature is below boiling. This actually happens all the time something is wet, after all when you dry yourself with a towel and just leave the towel hanging for a few hours it will be dry afterwards.  The reason you're seeing vapour in this case is because the air was very cold, this means that it can't actually hold a lot of steam, meaning these water molecules that escaped your wet clothing immediately condense back to tiny liquid droplets in the air, and these tiny liquid droplets are what you see as vapour
Pure Potassium being reactive means that it wants to violently bond with some other element. That's what makes it dangerous, but the potassium in bananas is in a molecule meaning that it's already reacted with something. That's what makes it safe. This is the same reason that the chlorine in tablet salt doesn't kill you. Fun fact, the Potassium in bananas also makes them slightly radioactive but you should keep eating them anyway. You get 10 times more radiation from sitting in front of an old school monitor than you do from a banana. It's perfectly safe. Because bananas are measurably radioactive physicists often joke about a BED - Banana Equivilent Dose. IE how many bananas would you have to eat to get as much radiation as a chest X-ray?  10,000
It deppends, but most of the time, a catalyst acts as an intermediate component of the reaction.   @@@Let's say we have a three reactions with elements A, B, and C that goes like this:  1) A + B -> AB 2) A + C -> AC 3) AC + B -> AB + C   @@@Imagine that reaction (1) is really slow to happen on its own, but (2) and (3) are really fast, so is easy to see that if I mix A, B, and C, what will happen is: A + B + C -> AC + B -> AB + C So, C acted as a catalyst; it helped the reaction (1) happening faster, and it was not consumed.
*Lots* of chemicals are used - there is no universal list to give you. For example, here are strawberry-tasting materials: http://www.perflavory.com/flavor/strawberry.html The "how" basically comes down to doing an analysis of Some Thing to find out what it's made of, then researching and experimenting from there.
A sensor that looks for sulphur in the air could probably detect bad breath. Sulphur (S) is the bad smell in morning breath, onions, and flatulence. They have breath sensors out there that react to certain chemicals exhaled in the breath. Smell is not a property of food, for example, but is a sense. Anytime you smell something, small gaseous particles of it are actually going up into your nose and getting captures and interpreted by olfactory sensors in the nose. Just a guess, but a bad breath or halitosis sensor might look for the chemicals released by mouth bacteria that cause breath smells (which people happen to interpret as bad smelling).
Opiates fit into receptors in the brain like a key in a key hole. Nalaxone blocks the keyhole. It's more technical than that but that's the basic way to say it.
Sunscreen works by blocking and absorbing UV rays through a combination of physical and chemical particles. Physical particles, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, are used to reflect UV radiation from the skin.
The color of the flame depends mostly on two things: fuel source and temperature. Cellulose (wood products) is the source most people see most often. It burns at a relatively low temperature, so it is orange and yellow.  @@@  @@@The higher the temperature, the lighter the color of the flame.  @@@  @@@Throw other fuels in the flame and you can change the color to red, green, blue, etc.
Hydrogen atoms have just one electron, acidity is the concentration of H+, or, hydrogen atoms without their electron, a single core, a naked proton and neutron pair. This is something that is not anything the proton and neutron desire, they desire an electron, so they take one, with force. In that process the donor loses an electron and becomes an ion and becomes soluble.
Alchemy was the medieval forerunner of chemistry, based on the supposed transformation of matter. It was concerned particularly with attempts to convert base metals into gold or to find a universal elixir. Although some of it was pseudoscience, a lot of it is what ended up becoming chemistry.
The heat from the toaster causes the moisture in the bread to evaporate, making it dry and crunchy. The heat also caramelizes the sugars present in the bread, making it golden brown. This process, called the Maillard Reaction is also what gives grilled or broiled meats the dark color on the surface while the inside stays lighter.
Yes.   Pressure cookers work by putting the food under pressure.  This increases the boiling point of water, which allows more heat to be put into the food, thus cooking it faster.  Certain chemical reactions (which is what cooking is - chemical reactions that happen with heat) won't happen below a certain temperate (or at least happen much, much slower).  This can lead to different textures or flavors when you cook at a higher temperature. You can mitigate this by carefully managing cooking time, but they will still happen.  In most cases, though, the time savings from pressure cooking far outweigh the negative impacts.
All you really need is a small amount of fluoride to help harden enamel and the rest is just a mild abrasive to help brush away deposits. Everything else is marketing. There’s not much new technology in toothpaste so it’s all personal taste.  Just regular brushing and flossing is all you need to keep good dental hygiene.  Two things I think are worthwhile:  ultrasonic electric toothbrushes. These seem very effective compared to  regular hand brushing. @@@Tongue scraper - just a simple cheap plastic one used daily helps with cleaning off deposits on your tongue and helps freshen breath.
so that the ingredients are incorporated throughout - you dont want a piece of whatever you are baking to have all the baking powder, or salt, or sugar - they need to be incorporated to also assist in the chemical reaction that is the batter
They used to do lab tests and to determined how many calories are in it they would set it on fire and see how hot it burned.  @@@Now a days they look up how much nutrition was in the ingredients (which were tested in a lab and averaged) and just add it up.
ELI5: the bubbles are hiding in the drink, and come out after everyone else is gone. The carbon dioxide is dissolved in the liquid. At higher pressure, liquids can hold more dissolved substances, so when you open the bottle/can and release the pressure, the dissolved carbon dioxide changes into a gas and forms bubbles
Carbon is good at adsorbing things. Meaning that stuff like toxins sticks to its surface really well. Charcoal is mostly made of carbon. That's why it's black. It's also very porous. That's why it's light and easy to crush. So it has a LOT of surface area - ten tablets of activated charcoal have a combined surface area the size of a football field. And the more surface area there is, the more stuff can be adsorbed. &#x200B; Note that charcoal is only *mostly* made of carbon. And there's a big difference between "mostly carbon" and "all carbon": ordinary charcoal, the sort that you get by burning wood, also has tars and all sorts of other gunk in it. The problem here is that normal charcoal's surface and *especially* its pores are almost completely clogged with said gunk. So most of charcoal's surface is useless: it can't be used to adsorb stuff. &#x200B; Normal charcoal adsorbs well (for example, it's good enough to purify moonshine before a final distillation), but it could adsorb a lot better IF you removed all the tar. The process of removing tar is called "activating" charcoal. The end result is that you have not just carbon, but *pure* carbon: all of its pores are free of gunk and all of its surface can be used to adsorb stuff. &#x200B; \-------- &#x200B; UPD: Got a few frequently asked questions ITT, so I'll answer them here. &#x200B; a) Adsorb is a real word. It's the same thing as "absorb", except stuff sticks to the surface of the *ad*sorbent instead of dissolving in the *ab*sorbent's volume. There is no real practical difference unless you're a chemist. But it's important to me to use chemical terms in a precise manner. That includes using the right word even when a wrong word would suffice. &#x200B; b) Toxins are harmful substances produced inside living organisms. Botulinum and penicillin are toxins, mercury chloride is not, methylmercury might or might not be a toxin (because you can make it in a lab, but living things can also make it). Whether a substance is harmful or not is subjective; there is no single chemical property that makes something toxic. Humans don't notice the harmful properties of capsaicin, whereas bugs find it to be a very deadly neurotoxin indeed. Yes, I know that word is used by corporations and indivivuals alike to sell useless stuff to people who don't know better. No, I won't stop using the word "toxin". It's a good word, and it means *exactly* what I think it means. I don't care who else uses it and for what purposes. &#x200B; c) A category I called "stuff like toxins" is better phrased as "everything, including poisonous substances, drugs and vitamins". Charcoal don't care, it just takes what it wants. &#x200B; d) It's called "activated" and not "clean" charcoal because "clean" would require a separate ELI5 to explain why it's better at its job to *every single customer* (except for a small portion of chemists). In days before the Internet, that would mean terribly high added costs. Whereas anyone can sort of understand why "activated" is better at scrubbing bad stuff from your gut. &#x200B; UPD2: Another frequently asked question, "how is it activated", I have already answered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/qgsty8/eli5_what_does_it_mean_when_charcoal_is_activated/hi968lo/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). That's far from an exhaustive description, but there are [good videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNKeps6pIao) on Youtube describing and demonstrating the process as well. In retrospect, I probably should have just linked that video from the start. It explains things brilliantly, shows how the process works, and demonstrates the difference between ordinary charcoal and activated charcoal with an iodine number test. &#x200B; UPD3: It appears that there's some large-scale kookery going on that I'm not aware of. And people are upset enough about it to ignore points b) and c) in this post in order to yell at me about stuff that I already know and have clearly stated, oh, maybe ten times already. So let me rephrase those points a bit more forcefully. &#x200B; e) Whatever snake oil salesmen or "health gurus" are telling you about activated carbon's miracle properties, it DOES NOT AND CANNOT HAVE MIRACLE PROPERTIES. All it can do is bind toxins that are in your gut right now. Like when you ate something moldy - then activated carbon can bind the toxic stuff that's in the mold. But it does so while binding *everything else* that isn't water, a short-chain alcohol or an inorganic salt. "Everything else" includes nutrients, vitamins and medicine. So using it as a food supplement is a *bad idea*. Chances are, you don't have enough vitamins in your diet as it is; don't waste the small amount that you already get by drinking sorbents when you don't have a dire need to. &#x200B; In other words: when you drink activated carbon, you poop most of the toxic stuff in your stomach out without getting it in your bloodstream. But you'll poop most of the useful stuff out as well. &#x200B; The only reason I said "stuff like toxins" is because that's what doctors in Russia are using it to adsorb: toxins in the food. Not, say, inorganic salts of heavy metals, that's what it doesn't adsorb very well; there are other things that bind them better. Also, they use activated charcoal once in a blue moon, specifically when you eat something bad or drink too many tablets of some other drug. They don't use it all the time, because like any normal person with a moderately good grasp of chemistry they KNOW it binds everything. &#x200B; Now that I made my position clear, please stop arguing with me about activated charcoal not having miracle properties. I *already know* that it doesn't.
The blood-brain barrier is an extra layer of protection between everything in your circulation and your brain, because your body really needs to keep your brain protected for you to live. The barrier tries to keep dangerous things out, and that includes a lot of molecules, including medications. A medication that doesn’t cross the BBB usually has little or no effect on your brain because it can’t reach your brain. It can still “hit hard” if its effect isn’t on brain cells and receptors. That’s one of the big differences between older antihistamines like Benadryl and newer ones like Claritin. Benadryl affects histamine receptors in your brain and makes you sleepy or confused. Claritin doesn’t cross as easily, so it doesn’t have that effect.
It’s a natural edible acid in the same sense as lemon juice is an edible acid and comes dissolved in water and other juices which add to the flavour and make it valuable for cooking. Unlike lemon juice vinegar is produced by bacteria through fermentation. Like lemon juice it’s acidic properties make it useful as a household cleaner as well. Because it’s an inhospitable environment for most microbes it can also serve as a preservative, but it will change the taste as it seeps into the food it’s preserving. Hence: pickles
Sugars in general are quite stable against surrounding conditions and will not, or only after a very long time (talking about years or decades) break down, if the bottle is closed. If the bottle is opened, eventually germs and fungi will invade and break down the sugar and everything else.@@@So to answer your question: No it will not happen on its own.@@@For sugar free beverages the industry just does not add sugar but instead adds other sweeteners. If you want to remove to sugar from some bought product (for whatever reason you'd do this), I can only think of one major pathway: Enzymes. With the correct enzymes, the sugar will get broken down to smaller molecules which will neither have a sweetening effect nor have the high amount of energy, sugar holds. Nevertheless, afterwards you'd have to remove the enzymes again through coagulation and filtration.@@@Important to mention: Enzymes work only at specific conditions (temperature, pH) so it'd take quite some trial and error to find the right (hopefully commercially available) enzyme for the product you want to desugarize.
How do you know it isn't as placebo? Have you had someone do a double blind test on you?
There isn't, though I usually hear "harsh chemicals" used referring to skin irritants. Assuming your gear is glass, rubbing alcohol and salt will be just fine. Rinse with water when done.
Coffee is a stimulant that gets all systems in your body moving \- Digestive sytem: have a seat  @@@\- Nervous system: have the shakes  @@@\- Mood chemicals (Dopamine) in the brain:  have a smile
The salonpas I'm aware of use topical Lidocaine which is a numbing agent/local anesthetic. All it does is block the pain signals at the nerve ends and does nothing to mitigate the cause of the pain.
Stability is relative. Nature tends towards the lowest energy state, O2 has a lower energy than lone oxygen atoms floating around. So if you have gaseous oxygen it is stable as O2. However it isn’t in its lowest energy state, if there is some copper in the system then the oxygen can react with it and release energy. The copper oxide had a lower energy than the lone copper and oxygen and so is a more stable state.
All water has some dissolved gas in it. I'm fairly sure that as water freezes (and expands due to the way the water molecules arrange in a crystal) the gas is pushed out of solution and forms the bubbles.
Yes, actually; but the reasons are merely historical now. As you might know, there are several *quantum numbers* that identify where an electron "is," or what shell it fits into. One of those numbers is the *angular momentum number* ℓ, and it's this number we're interested in. In the early days of spectroscopy, scientists noted that some series of spectral lines of alkali metals -- those corresponding to ℓ-values of zero through three -- appeared to be **s**harp, **p**rincipal in nature, **d**iffuse in nature, and **f**undamentally related to hydrogen lines, in order.
It doesn't exist. Simple as that. There is no such thing as a "truth serum." There are chemicals that can lower your inhibitions and make you more susceptible  to saying things you wouldn't otherwise say (think alcohol) but there are simply no substances that exist that can cause consistent or predictable enhancement of truth-telling.
Because the way the restaurant makes it and the way the bottling company makes it are totally different. The bottling company's process is optimized for large-scale batch production: thousands or tens of thousands of liters at a time. If the restaurant is brewing it in house, they're maybe making ten to fifty liters at a time. The processes will be completely different, and the product will be different as a result.
hand sanitizer is mostly alcohol so it is flammable, like vodka is. an electric spark will light flammable things.
Big tobacco literally paid to have scenes like that put in movies to make smoking seem cool and sell more. "Thank you for smoking" is a good movie that covers alot of shit like this.
>Does the humidity in the air gather around the bottle? Yes. The bottle is much cooler than its surroundings, so as the air passes over it, it drops to its dew point, causing water to precipitate onto the surface.
Stress concentration. Let's imagine a sheet of paper, gripped evenly on both ends and pulled apart. Not hard enough to tear, yet, but it's in tension. Held in front of you, pulling left and right. Let's look at the middle of this paper, a line running up the center - this line should be right between your hands as you stretch the paper sideways. At any point on this line, the paper is experiencing maybe 1 pound per inch. That's not enough to tear it, but it's a lot. Now we introduce a small snip at the edge of the paper - cutting the end of the line. It still hasn't torn. Imagine what the paper at that snip is doing - it's pulling apart now, so obviously it is no longer bearing that 1 pound per inch. Instead, the stress it would be experiencing is passed on to the paper right where the cut ended. The stretchier our material, the more spread out this stress is. Paper's not very stretchy, so you get a lot of stress concentrated right where your cut stopped. Way more than the original one pound per inch. At this point, the paper probably starts to tear where the stress is greatest. As the tear grows, this point of high stress is pushed along with it.
Everything you stick the tape to is dirty. That dirt bonds to the tape adhesive, leaving less exposed adhesive to adhere to the next thing. The top of the tape is clean when it's rolled so there's not schmoo on the adhesive.
When manufacturing glass facilities put iron oxide in the glass to assist with production. When you look through glass normally, the thickness is so thin the tint is almost impossible to see. When you look at glass from the side, the thickness of glass is an order of magnitude thicker and therefore the tint is much more noticeable.
Drugs with longer half lives so gradually build up. Often, when someone starts a long term prescription, it takes a while to get to what’s called a therapeutic level, which is basically what your question describes. You might take 50mg once a day, but your liver only lets 5mg into your bloodstream, and after 24 hrs only 2.5 are left, but you need 35 mg circulating for the medication to work, so you don’t notice much of an effect for the first 2 weeks you’re taking it.
They are not causing physical damage. They are chemically interfering with biological processes. Things like neuron transmissions only use very small amounts of certain chemicals for signaling. There are a massive number of them, but atoms and molecules are extremely small. It takes HUGE numbers to create masses large enough for us to see and interact with. To explain what I'm about to do, there is a concept called the mole. It is based on Avagadro's Number, which is 6.022 x 10 \^ 23. Or 602,200,000,000,000,000,000,000. A "mole" of a substance is an amount consisting of that number of particles, be it atoms or molecules. So a mole of iron is a piece of iron that has 6.022 x 10 \^ 23 iron atoms. A mole of water is a drop with 6.022 x 10 \^ 23 water molecules. Fentanyl has a molar weight of 336.471 grams / mole. That is roughly 0.003 moles per gram. So a gram of fentanyl has approximately 1, 806 QUINTILLION fentanyl molecules.  Not specifically fentanyl, but say there is a chemical that binds to neuron receptors and blocks signalling. It has the same molar weight as fentanyl and you get just 1 milligram into your system. That is still enough to block 1.8 QUINTILLION receptor sites in your body. This assumes that every molecule reaches a receptor site and binds with it, which is never going to happen. Just giving numbers to demonstrate the concept.
Cotton candy is "spun sugar". The basic idea is to melt sugar to the point that it will flow though a small nozzle and then solidify in the form of thin, flexible threads. To do this a cotton candy machine spins a heated cup that has tiny holes along the outer edge, connected to the bottom of the cup. As the sugar melts it can flow through the holes and is thrown through open air that cools it, collecting on the outer rim of a surrounding tub.
Soap doesn't really need to bubble or be foamy. Companies add it to make if feel like its cleaning better. Bubbles have nothing to do with cleaning.  The common ingredients that make soap foam are sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), sodium lauryl sulfate (sometimes referred to as sodium dodecyl sulfate or SLS) and coco-glucoside.
That's for the 2nd shell, atoms can have more shells than that. Each shell is limited to 2n^2 electrons, where *n* is the number of the shell. So a 3rd shell can support up to 18, etc. The reason *why* there is a maximum is all quantum mechanic stuff. Basically there's four numbers in quantum numbers that can completely describe a particular electron in a shell completely, and if you exceed that specific number in a shell then you end up having 2 electrons with the same 4 numbers, which is impossible.
Yes. All temperature is _average_ thermal energy. In that 8oz cup of 40F water there are a few water molecules that are 41, 42 and so on and there are some that are cooler. But on average its 40F.  When you combine the two 8oz glasses, you now 16 oz at an average temperature of 60F.  If the hot water were to "take over" and cause the average of the combined 16 oz to warm closer to 80F that would be a violation of thermodynamic law - where did the extra heat come from? If no heat entered the system them the total overall heat has to remain the same.
The technical term for this is contrails. As a plane flies at high altitude water droplets that come out of the engines mix with particulates from exhaust gases and freeze as they come into contact with the air forming crystals. The contrail is basically an artificial cloud, so it stays up there until it dissipates. If you search for this online you'll no doubt find what conspiracy theorists refer to as *chemtrails* believing this ridiculous idea that planes are dumping chemicals into the air to poison you, keep the populous under control or whatever. It's total nonsense.
Because it basically ferments/rots in some way.@@@Or it’s just weird chemistry that only happens when exposed to open air for long periods.
The short answer is that we don't really know. One popular working theory is that depression is caused by inbalances of substances in the brain (neurotransmitters like dopamine etc.), and that antidepressents help fix this inbalance. There is lots of evidence to suggest this isn't what occurs however - we haven't ditched the theory because every other way we have of explaining what occurs is even less useful. There's definitely a nobel prize in it for whoever finally manages to crack this one! Despite not really knowing how they work, we still use them because for a lot of people they are effective - we're just not sure why it helps for some people but not others.
Alcohol and water mix. That is, the alcohol actually dissolves in the water and forms bonds with it. This solution has a much lower freezing point than just pure water, it's actually a new homogenous solution.
Ok, so it helps to think of chemicals in terms of an analogy with real objects.  Imagine your chemicals as balls tied together with rope. **But**, in between the two balls, there’s a compressed spring pushing them apart. The spring can’t separate them because they’re tied together, but it’s trying its best to shove them.  Imagine an exothermic reaction as cutting that string. Now that the balls aren’t tied together anymore, the spring shoves the balls apart super hard, making them shoot off in opposite directions. Now you have two balls moving around and bouncing off of things.  You may have heard that heat is just the movement of small particles. Well, in our analogy, since the balls are small particles, and now they’re moving around, we just released heat.  _____ I saw you asking how potential energy is converted into motion in another comment chain. It’s very much analogous to the spring.  When the balls are bonded together (attached with a string), there’s a bunch of potential energy stored in the spring that can’t escape.  Once you input the activation energy for the reaction (cutting the string), you break the bond, and all the potential energy shoves the particles apart, giving them kinetic energy. ____ **Edit:** *ATP is different though. In that process, we’re actually trying to release as little heat as possible, since heat just escapes into the environment, and the energy that went into it is lost to us.* *Essentially, with ATP, we’re using the decompression from our spring (cellular respiration reaction) to shoot the ball right into another spring. That spring gets compressed from the ball shooting into it, and then we drop a latch across the two balls, forcing them to stay together, just like with the knot tying our balls together earlier.* *The important thing here though, is that since we used a latch to hold the balls together, instead of tying a knot, it’s a lot easier to release the balls again when we’re ready. That’s essentially what ATP is doing. It’s making a compressed spring system that’s super easy for us to unlatch when we need the energy.*
Firefighter here. Fire needs 3 things to exist. Fuel, oxygen, and heat. I’d you remove 1, the fire can no longer exist.  Take a candle. Put the lid on it. The oxygen runs out, and the fire goes out. Wild land firefighting is about fuel management. Remove new things for the fire to burn and it will burn itself out.  Now for your average structure fire. It’s too big to remove the oxygen from. It’s too large to dismantle the house and thus remove the fuel. So we have to remove the heat.  Water is really good at removing heat. It’s also really cheap and easy to get.  Fires don’t actually burn objects the way you think they do. Every item has an ignition point. This point is the temperature at which the item begin to puts off flammable gasses. These gasses are what are actually burning. These gasses are hot, the same temperature as the objects ignition point. When you start a fire, it takes a minute to ignite whatever it is you’re trying to burn. The flame from your ignition source is heating up and drying out whatever your fuel is. Once the fuel is hot enough, the gasses it puts off ignites. This spreads over the object, more heat, more drying, more gasses releasing, more ignition.  This is what smoke is. It’s actually unburned fuel. If you get smoke hot enough, it can ignite and burn. Water is introduced to a fire. It is colder than the hot burning gases and this pulls heat away from the fire, turning to steam in the process. That continues, until the super hot burning gasses are cooled to the point that they are below their ignition temperature. Not enough heat, fire goes out. Water is easy to get. It’s practically limitless. It’s used for a lot of other stuff within cities too. So it’s easy to throw an extra pipe down into the city’s water system, put a cap on it, and bam, fire hydrant. Further, it doesn’t cause environmental issues when you’re using it in the abundance we use it to fight fires.  Sure, there are substances out there that are more effective than water at removing heat, but they’re expensive and impractical to use most of the time. They also may require special equipment. Water can be sprayed through hoses and nozzles easily. Firefighting foam is fantastic at putting fires out but they aren’t as easy to use and you can’t use it in the volume you need on most fires.  Some fuels require special foams or powders to put out because water won’t work. Water may mix with the chemical on fire and cause a reaction. That is why there are different types of extinguishers.  TLDR: water is good at removing heat and is plentiful and cheap enough to be used universally to put out fires by removing the heat. Edit: there are tons of comments about the fire tetrahedron. Yes, that is the current model for fire behavior. It’s a bit outside of the ELI5 level so I chose to keep it simple. The fire triangle is easy to understand, explain, and show. It’s hard to explain and show a chemical chain reaction.
It’s because you broke the deal on the container. Get two jugs of milk with one holding a gallon and the other a quart and they will be pretty much the same as long as you don’t open them. The reason opening it makes it spoil faster is that bacteria in the air can get into it. Milk is pasteurized in the production of it to remove microbes and make it last longer on the shelf.
The one color is at the base where the outlet is and gets mixed in right as it leaves the cap. If you cut open the tube it would look like one colour at the top and another colour at the bottom. [Here you go](https://i.imgur.com/fDYPfid.png)
Primarily because distillation increases the concentration of all the alcohol in the final product. All fermentation produces a mixture of methanol (the bad alcohol) and ethanol (the good alcohol). Generally the concentration of methanol is rather small in the primary fermentation product and it is therefore not dangerous (wine and beer)  Methanol boils at a lower temperature than ethanol. Therefore when distilling, the initial distillate contains a very high (and poisonous) concentration of methanol. The distiller has to discard the initial distillate to get rid of (most of) the methanol.
sodium sulucoaluminate is an anti caking agent. It keeps the salt from clumping together. Iodized salt is often used because humans need iodine, and if a population lives far from the sea, that is an easy way to ensure everyone gets it. Dextrose apparently stabilizes the iodine.
They dissolved it into tea, it did slightly poison everyone else, and it hurt him most because he’s the only one that drank the tea. The polonium can’t poison you too badly from outside the skin, because the particles are too heavy to get inside. But once inside they tear everything apart. Basically the dust got everywhere, as dust does, and that’s how the authorities traced the poisoning.
Working for a large scale food manufacturer in the quality assurance department, I can assure you that the values on the NFPs are pretty accurate. However, they do allow about a 20% variance from the true value. There are multiple different tests that can be conducted to extract and quantify fats, proteins, carb, vitamins and minerals. These values are usually remain constant in each ingredient and are compiled in to a database so that they can be easily referenced when creating nutritionals for new products. The fats, proteins, and carbs are the only things which contribute caloric value to a food - 9, 4, and 4 calories per gram respectively - and are combined to create total calories in a product. Edit: More explanation
The sun evaporates *water* from the ocean; the salt is left behind. This is one way water is *desalinated* -- boil it or evaporate it away, then collect the resulting water. Bonus: you can also collect the left-behind salt.
Well the salt is breaking down into smaller molecules which are smaller than the pores in the filter and therefore can pass through.  If your got a filter with pores smaller than a molecule of salt, the solution would not pass through the filter.
The key difference between those 3 is the amount of fat they contain - butter is mostly milkfat (around 80%+), while cream ranges from around 30-50% depending on type, and milk is way down around 3.5% (or less if not using whole milk).  This affects the final texture of the ganache - how thick and solid, or how loose and liquidy it ends up. Traditional ganache is just a 50/50 mixture of chocolate and cream - it's got a nice silky texture and a lot of richness from the fat in the cream.  Some people prefer less fat content, so they'll mix cream and milk together to get a final result that's still somewhat silky, but a little looser and a little less rich - or they may go with milk only, but that usually requires using less milk or using other tricks to make sure it doesn't end up too runny, because milk has a higher liquid content than cream, since it has so much less fat. In a pinch, butter and milk can be a substitute for cream, if you run out or if heavy cream isn't available.  A little bit of melted butter mixed with milk will add some fat and richness and work as a substitute for heavy cream, to get that texture and glossy finish.  It's just all about balancing out how much fat is going into the end product.
The chemical reactions in your body are set and unchanging. It is impossible to introduce new chemical pathways. All pharmacology is either enhancing or suppressing one of these pathways. Drug side effects occur when the drug is chemically similar enough to interact with something in a different pathway other the one it is intended to work on. all the chemical pathways are interconnected as well so slowing one down or speeding one up is likely to have a “domino” effect which causes other effects to occur. Furthermore the same chemicals can serve multiple roles depending on the tissue they are present in, taking an analogue of that chemical systemically may cause multiple different effects in different tissues.

Steroids are molecules that have 17 carbon atoms arranged into four rings.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid However by that definition cholesterol is also a steroid (aka sterol-like).  Steroid hormones are substances that activate certain nuclear receptors, like the sex hormones testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone which activate their respective receptors, and the corticosteroids which include mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. If you have medicines which suppresses the immune system, those are glucocorticoids. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid The steroids that make muscles grow bigger (anabolic-androgenic steroids) activate the testosterone receptor.
It's not difficult. It only requires either lots of time and area (natural evaporation) or enormous amounts of energy (distillation) for comparatively low yields.
Well our body uses many many more enzymes to process other stuff, but you simply don't hear about them a lot. Our metabolism is basically burning anything we eat, and a whole arsenal of enzymes allows that at temperatures that don't kill us (by being catalysts for the reactions) B12 is actually transformed into 2 enzymes, Adenosylcobalamine and Methylcobalamine. It's purpose isn't, "being processed in large quantities for energy" but it's rather part of the processing side.
Glass is made of two things silicon and oxygen. to dissolve it you need to be able to separate these two things apart. Think of these as a husband and wife.  Their bond is quite strong as its quite a stable relationship. Then comes the homewrecker called acid bringing their attractive ions along. Other couples are attracted to these ions more than their husband/wife therefore they dissolve. The bond in glass is too strong more most acids to break. Except hydroflouric acid. They're the kneau reeves of the acid world. HOT. Edit: after a long hard think... Im leaving the typos in. Edit2: thanks for all the awards! Was not expecting that!
When food is reheated that draws moisture out of it.  This is why for very greasy or wet food it's not usually a big deal, and some can even end up being soggier than originally as that water gets moved around and some more was probably picked up as condensation inside the fridge.
They don't. Only thing that happens is a chemical reaction, there is nothing added to the battery when charging it, charging is just rearranging the electrons inside the battery.
It was always explained to me is that hot water will raise the outer layers of the meat to unacceptable, unsafe temperatures for unsafe periods of time, while the inner parts of the meat remain frozen. Whereas cold water will defrost the meat but not quickly put the meat into temperature ranges where you've got rampant bacterial growth, etc. When you water soak meat to help thaw it, you're not trying to cook the meat.  Hot water is completely unnecessary.  Cold water is cold but it's not THAT cold.  Else it would be ice.  Ever come in from a bitter cold day and put your hand under cold water, but it feels like hot water because compared to your hand it's warmer?  It's that. I'm not a food scientist; that's just how my grandmother taught me.
Secret recipes are really a rarity, unless theres an ingredient that is not and can not be reproduced by any other entity on the planet, everything can be reverse engineered and figured out. But with that you run into things like: Why are you putting so much effort into reverse-engineering a food?@@@And@@@You’ll receive a cease and desist letter PDQ if you’re infringing on someones registered intellectual property.
Basically there are receptors that the drug binds to like a puzzle piece. Narcan also fits that puzzle piece, so it attaches to the receptors instead of the drug.
The key to recognize is that we don’t produce electricity the way we do in our power plants…you don’t have conductive wires in your body carrying electrons around.  Your body used ions…charged atoms. Lots of common materials, e.g. salt, split into a positive and negative ions when they dissolve in water. Special biological structures called ion pumps can selectively push one kind of ion through a membrane and leave the other behind.  Now you’ve got a concentration of positively charged ions on one side of a barrier and negatively charged one on the other side…we have an electrical potential (a voltage difference). They want to recombine. If we let the ions come back together the voltage difference goes away and we have an electrical pulse, then the ion pumps can restore the potential. It’s creating and releasing these ion potentials that humans (and most other critters) use for electrical signaling.
RI at the end of both of them means “reuptake inhibitor”  When two nerve endings send a message to one another, they release Serotonin = S and Norepinephrine = N which is picked up by little finger-doodles on the receiving nerve ending. But this doesn’t happen instantly, they should stay in the gap between the nerves long enough for the “message” to be received and passed on. Then after the message is gone, both the S and the N are reabsorbed (reuptake) back into the surrounding two nerves.  Sometimes in people with disorders like depression there isn’t enough Serotonin or norepinephrine in that space between nerves for the messages to be adequately passed. and thus the message isn’t very well passed or received.  SSRI’s slow down the reabsorption specifically for serotonin, while SNRI’s slow down the reabsorption for both S and N. Allowing more serotonin or norepinephrine to build up between the nerves, allowing adequate time for the message to pass :) The uses of each vary based on whether it’s not enough Serotonin, not enough norepinephrine, or not enough of both :) hope this helped! Source- I work for a psychiatrist, and this is how he Eli-5’d it for me a few years ago. . Please don’t take me comment as medical law and leave the real answers to the real doctors :)
>Why does waterproof outdoor paint (fences, decking etc) need time to dry?  @@@  @@@Because unless the solvent has fully evaporated it's still going to be partially liquid, meaning it can be easily smudged, removed or even washed away.
There are other substances that evaporate with water making it difficult to separate.  The wasting part comes through wasting clean drinking water. It's difficult, expensive, and not energy efficient to clean water for drinking. Once it's mixed with other chemicals, or into the sewage system, it's no longer considered drinkable water. Can't use it for crops, animals, etc.
I would imagine a solid stick would not be a very effective way. There are many water filters that rely on charcoal to filter out small particles, but usually the water is being passed though many small grains of charcoal to maximize surface area and ensure all the water comes in close contact. Charcoal works by being extremely porous and craggy.  Small particles in the water that come into contact with the surface of Charcol get stuck and are therefor removed from the water. So you want every single drop of water to pass across or through as much of the surface as possible. . So yes, Charcoal can be an effective way to filter many particles from water, but stirring with a solid charcoal stick is probably the least effective way to do it. Probably more effective to grind the stick up, place the grounds in a coffee filter or cheese cloth, and slowly pour the water through it.
Metallic hydrogen (a superconductor) would allow rockets to carry less fuel and increase payload. It basically provides equivalent amounts of energy with less volume.
Okay so, our brains work by sending messages via neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters activate receptors to get the message across (like a letter in a mailbox). We have receptors for all different kinds of neurotransmitters that our bodies make. Drugs act at some of these same receptors.@@@These messages via neurotransmitter and receptor are important to keep our body functioning. And our body likes normal functioning. When you take drugs, you activate these receptors in a way that is exaggerated - the receptors really get over-activated. But our bodies don’t really like this because it isn’t normal functioning. So our body is like “wow okay I guess maybe we need to make some changes to get back to normal.” Usually it can achieve this just by elimination of the drug. However, repeated use of a drug makes our brains go “okay WOW guess elimination isn’t doing the trick really” so it decides to get rid of some of the receptors in an effort to regain normal functioning (homeostasis). Think of it like - you have 5 different mailboxes and usually you get 1 letter in each mailbox every day, on average, so you think 5 is a great amount. All of sudden, you start getting 50 letters in each mailbox every day and you can barely get anything else done bc there’s so much mail! Naturally, the first thing you’ll want to do is get rid of all of these mailboxes! Like, you no longer need 5, it’s just too much for you to handle. So your body is like “okay cool just gonna get rid of some of these receptors bc clearly we need fewer of them to maintain normal functioning.” When you abruptly stop taking the drug, now you only have a few receptors and normal functioning is again hard for your body. (Like, okay now you get way less mail because you have 1 mailbox. Great! Except now that there isn’t this huge influx of mail that forced you to remove your other 4 mailboxes, you realize you’re missing out on 4 letters per day that you were getting before and oh! It turns out those were actually pretty important.) It takes some time for your body to again adjust itself to normal functioning. While it’s adjusting, you’re brain has too few of these receptors for normal functioning, and it causes you to go through withdrawal.  TL;DR Your brain makes changes to account for the high level of activation at certain receptors caused by drug use. When the drug is no longer on board, those brain changes cause you to experience withdrawal symptoms. Eventually, your brain will make more changes to get back to normal and the withdrawal symptoms will fade. (Some details are different for different drugs - alcohol and nicotine in particular are kinda weird. But in general, this is what happens).
As there is [no medical evidence](https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/womens-health/myth-busting-no-more-8-glasses-a-day) saying 8 glasses a day is beneficial, it doesn’t really matter.  The idea behind the “common knowledge” statement is simply to be sure you’re drinking enough water. Since caffeine is a diuretic, you will need more water to balance that out. The only way to actually know if you’re getting enough water is to listen to your body.  The easiest indicator is your pee. It should be pretty clear to a pale yellow, and you should have a lot of it. You should also be going 6-8 times a day.  Other signs of dehydration are things like feeling tired, headaches, dizziness, dry lips and skin, and a few more.  There are frequently shifting factors that go into how much water you need each day. You can set a goal, but especially when drinking caffeine, it’s better to just pay attention to the signs.
I assume you mean a can?  Basically when a liquid cools down it begins to expand. A can of pop only hold a certain amount of contents so as it expands it slowly puts strain on the can until it eventually ruptures.
Rice and pasta can contain bacteria whose spores survive the cooking process. If boiled rice or pasta are left out at 12-14° C for a long time (more than 4-6 hours), it can become extremely dangerous to eat. At this temperature the spore producing bacteria can form heat resistant toxins.

Why do you know that urine is salty?
Air has gassy water vapor in it that is ready to condense back into liquid water when the air can't carry it any more. *Well*, it turns out that *cold* air can't carry as much water as *warm* air. So, when you've got a colder beverage and it starts sucking heat energy out of the air, it is also "coldening" the air to the point where it starts to deposit its water vapor, too.
Cooking is not just about safety, it's also matter of taste and texture changes - killing everything harmful can be achieved at mere 75 C, or even lower but at longer time. Only bacterial spores survive that, but they don't matter for food eaten immediately, they won't have time to wake up and multiply. But at 75 degrees meat hasn't even reached boiling point of water and various other chemical reactions occur at even higher temperatures - to sear/brown the meat or caramelize sugars you need 140.
People here are saying that it's because it evaporates quickly, but that's not why it's flammable, that's why it is easy to make it burn, which is kinda different.   @@@Let's look at another very flammable material : magnesium. Magnesium burns at aroung 3000°C, if i remember correctly. It's absurdely bright and hot. But it's not easy to make it burn, you need to heat it with an open flame for ten seconds, maybe more, before it starts burning, because it's not volatile at all. If you could make very fine magnesium powder and threw that in the air, then tried to ignite it, it would probably ignite very easily, and be extremely dangerous, don't do that.   @@@What makes rubbing alcohol flammable is the reaction it has with oxygen.   @@@To explain that, I will NOT use rubbing alcohol, which is isopropyl alcohol, but a simpler alcohol : ethanol.   @@@When you burn ethanol, you make it react with a specific "version" of oxygen. That "version" is just like regular O2, but it's EXTREMELY reactive. That "version" of oxygen is randomly create everywhere O2 exists, but the more you heat something, the more of this reactive oxygen is created. There is more reactive oxygen in heated air than in cold air.   @@@Now let's look at the chemical reaction : C2H6O + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 3H2O   @@@That means that, when you burn ethanol with oxygen, you create carbon dioxyde and water. And that creates heat. It creates heat because CO2 and H2O are more stable than ethanol and that reactive oxygen, but it's a bit complicated, so all you have to know is that it creates a lot of heat.   @@@But as I said earlier, heat creates that reactive oxygen, and that reactive oxygen reacts with ethanol to burn it, which creates heat, etc...   @@@So, basically, ethanol is flammable because when you create heat near it, it will react with oxygen in a way that creates enough heat to create more reactive oxygen and keep the reaction going.   @@@Also there is a reason to the fact that it can't heat up infinitely and will stabilize at some temperature after a few seconds of burning, but that's also complicated.   @@@And last thing, you can use things that are not oxygen to burn things, but again, it's complicated.
It's hard to imagine any flame as "the original one". Fire is one the products of a continuous chemical reaction, so the flame is constantly a new one, even on the same candle.
Water vapor is perfectly content to exist below boiling. Boiling temperature is special because, while at lower temperatures, the water occupies some of the air, at and above boiling it wants to occupy more than all of the air. Since it can never occupy more than all of the air above it, it keeps becoming a gas until it either runs out of heat or it runs out of water. For more detailed explanations, search the sub, as this is one of the most commonly asked questions.
So the thing about radiation, outside of the most extremely high concentrations it isn't going do much of anything immediately where you can really easily see cause and effect. Those super high concentrations don't exist naturally, they have to be refined into that. Even in modern times after something like the chernobyl disaster only 31 people directly died from it, the rest of the effects are long term increases in things like cancer rates which we can really only figure out because of statistics and having a huge sample size.
Nothing, this is called a "hydrogen fuel cell". Some problems are that hydrogen is a gas at standard temperature and pressure which introduces some storage challenges. It would require very high pressure, very low temperature, or some sort of stabilizing substrate to hold a significant amount in a tank. While you can just pour gasoline into a tank or can, transferring hydrogen is a bit more difficult. Rupturing a hydrogen fuel tank can also far more easily result in a violent explosion than a gasoline fuel tank, which just tends to burn vigorously. You also need to actually get the electricity to produce the hydrogen, and that often takes fossil fuels.
Like other constants that have dimensions, the gas constant is fundamentally a statement about how large the units we're using are, relative to one another. In this case, it's the product of two other constants: * Avogadro's constant, which defines the number of particles in a mole. If a mole were more (or fewer) molecules, then this constant would take on a different value, and so would the ideal gas constant.@@@* The Boltzmann constant, which describes the relationship between temperature and energy. Specifically, the Boltzmann constant describes how much the energy of *each individual particle* in gas increases (on average) for each 1 degree Kelvin increase in temperature. If we used different energy or temperature units, this constant would take on a different value, and so would the ideal gas constant. Since we're multiplying the change in energy per particle (Boltzmann constant) by the number of particles per mole (Avogadro's constant), the gas constant describes the change in energy of one mole of an ideal gas per 1 degree Kelvin of temperature change. In other-other words, it describes the relationship between the temperature of a mole of ideal gas and the energy contained within that gas, in terms of whatever units you write it in. So if, for example, you write it in J K^-1 mol^-1 as you usually do, it expresses a relationship between energy (Joules) and temperature and number of moles (K and mol).  In other-other-other words, it describes the relationship between macroscopic moles and degrees of temperature and microscopic number of particles and energy per particle. It's a conversion factor between the scales of everyday lab thermodynamics and the scales of particle physics. (EDITED because "Boltzmann" is hard to spell.)
It would not explode. It would rupture and burn, for sure, but not explode.  For something to explode, you need the fuel to be mixed well with oxidizer, allowing the whole thing to ignite at once. In the scenario you posit, only the surface would be exposed to air
Well the B Vitamins are completely different unrelated chemicals. They got named together because they all got discovered together and only later it was found out it was actually a mix of substances. There are also gaps in the numbers because even later we discovered some of them weren't actually Vitamins
Super cold things burn because they’re physically damaging the body and killing cells. When you touch a bit piece of metal and burn yourself, the heat energy form the metal enters your hand and starts damaging/killing cells, setting of your pain nerves. When you touch an ice cube and your hand/finger feels cold/numb, the ice cube isn’t actually damaging you, it’s just cooling your cells down, which makes your nerves cells work less which causes the reduction of pain/numbness feeling. When you touch some extremely cold, like liquid nitrogen, then that is so cold that IT IS actually instantly freezing and destroying/damaging cells, and that destruction/damage is what sets off your nerves to make you feel pain.
The yellowing is residual dirt and sweat residue that doesn’t fully clean out during a wash.  You need something stronger. Trying to get white laundry back to white is why companies sell bleach.
It’s not air, it’s actually water vapour. When water boils, it turns from liquid water to gas water, but still just water.@@@Some of the bubbles may be from dissolved gases coming out of solution as the water warms (warm water can’t hold as much dissolved gas as cold water), but the big bubbles of boiling water is just water vapour.
It takes a lot of energy.  @@@In oil, most of that energy cost was paid by ancient micro-organisms collecting the energy from the sun.
Charcoal isn't burnt. It's pyrolysed, which is a different process. Plants are made mostly of cellulose and (in the case of wood) lignin, which are complex molecules that contain a lot of carbon. Burning a plant reacts those molecules with oxygen in the air to produce mostly carbon dioxide and water, which are both gases at the temperature of a flame and thus fly away into the air. (In practice, flames are usually a bit 'dirty' and contain a number of other things too.) There are two steps to this chemical reaction: *breaking* the bonds in the molecules that already exist (which consumes some energy) and then *recombining* the resulting parts with oxygen (which releases more energy than the first step consumed, so both steps together produce energy on net). In charcoal, wood or other organic material is heated, but not supplied with enough oxygen for a true flame. For example, it might be buried in a pile below ground with only a little oxygen available. This heating causes the first step of the reaction, breaking down the complex organic molecules into mostly free carbon + other stuff. But there's not enough oxygen for much of the second step to take place, so it stops there. (In practice, a little oxygen is introduced - just enough to allow enough of the second step to happen to keep the pile of material hot enough to continue breaking down.) This first step alone is called *pyrolysis* (Greek: *pyro* "fire" + *lysis* "to break down"). The resulting charcoal is effectively a chunk of mostly-pure carbon, which burns with a cleaner and hotter flame because many impurities have been removed (particularly water, which takes a lot of energy to evaporate) and because it doesn't have to consume energy to allow the first step of the reaction.
Imagine that they invent a substance so sweet (much sweeter than sugar) that less than a calorie of that substance can sweeten a whole bottle of Diet Coke. Now use that substance for this purpose.
Dry shampoo is a spray on powder that will absorb the extra oil in your hair. They often have added scents to make your hair smell good. They don’t actually remove dirt or clean your hair like traditional shampoos do.
Methyl salicylate absorbs ultraviolet light from excited nitrogen, and then re-emits the energy as a blue light.  This is fluorescence. Crystallized sugar also emits a very faint light through a similar mechanism.  This is called triboluminescence.
Quantum mechanics dictates that the electrons within atoms can only exist at discreet energy levels. These energy levels are different depending on what atom you have, and are also different for molecules vs individual atoms. When you hit an atom with light, it absorbs it, and goes into a higher energy level.  Then, the atom can emit a new beam of light, but because of that restriction, that light can only be of certain energy levels, and the energy of light is determined by its color. So, if you look at what color your object emits, you can determine what atom emitted that light. They're "read" by comparing them to the spectral lines emitted by known atoms.
Meat is tough if it has a lot of connective tissue, which is collagen. @@@Cooking it for a long time turns that to gelatin. As for savory flavor, that's coming from ingredients with *umami*. > Foods that have a strong umami flavor include meats, shellfish, fish (including fish sauce and preserved fish such as maldive fish, sardines, and anchovies), tomatoes, mushrooms, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, meat extract, yeast extract, cheeses, and soy sauce. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami Obviously some of those can't be used in vegan cooking, but some can. Drying mushrooms and tomatoes concentrates their flavor. I'm not sure if processed MSG powder counts as vegan, but if so you can add a bit of that.
Its called sewer sludge or biosolids. A lot of it is used as fertilizer on farm land after it meets testing requirements, I think..@@@Basically its seperated and dried out then spread. @@@EPA information is here -> https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/basic-information-about-biosolids
Standard cocaine is a water-soluble powder. You normally absorb it through various membranes (the gums, the nose, etc.). Crack cocaine is a cheaper, easier form of 'freebasing' - a technique where you make chemical changes to permit melting the cocaine into a gas that can be inhaled. By consuming the cocaine in this way, it reaches the blood stream much more quickly. This allows using a relatively small amount of cocaine to get an immediate and intense high.
a Mole is a number, like a dozen donuts is 12 donuts. It comes from the need for chemists to be able to relate number of atoms to a reasonable size. One mole is defined as the number of atoms in 12 grams of Carbon, and that turns out to be 6.022 x 10^23 . So you can then use it along with how heavy your atoms are to see how many atoms are in whatever sample you have. It's useful for transferring between "number of atoms" and "mass of your sample" through the value called "molar mass", which is a number for each atom that says how many grams 1 mole would be.
Soap/detergents don't break oil down.  They simply emulsify it, or hold it in suspension.  It is still 100% oil, just distributed differently... in the water rather than on the water.
I have the opposite, a nice beer tastes a better when I eat a Döner with it.@@@Maybe it's some ingredient in your wings that prime your tongue for a certain taste and you taste less of the flavour of your beer and more the alcohol.
There is chemical energy in stored in gas, which released in the form of heat when burned, an internal combustion engine turns this heat into pressure, and that pressure into motion. It does this by burning gas in the cilinders which push the pistons, which in turn rotate the crankshaft, which after some gearing rotates the weels of the car, and provides power to the cars electrical systems.
It reduces the [surface tension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension) of water because it has [surfactants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant) like [alcohol ethoxylate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethoxylation). Normally, water likes to "clump" or stick together as water droplets. This wouldn't be a problem, except the water in your dishwasher isn't pure: tap water has a bunch of dissolved solids in it, like calcium, magnesium, and other minerals. These solids are left behind after the water evaporates, and your dishes get "water spots". By breaking the surface tension, water doesn't stick together and instead "sheets" off your dishes, taking the dissolved minerals with it. So your dishes stay clear.
The celsius scale was invented first, and set 0 as the freezing point of water and 100 as its boiling point. Those are nice memorable, measurable temperatures. Later on scientists worked out that absolute zero is -273.15 celsius. At some point scientists started thinking "wouldn't it be easier to count up from absolute zero rather than be dealing with minus numbers?" So they decided to make a scale starting at absolute zero. But what *size* should the units be? Well why not just make them the same size as the units in celsius, which everyone already knows? That's nice and simple. So we ended up with two scales where the units are the same size, but which start at different points.
The common definition of flammable means "will readily burn in the presence of oxygen, if you get it hot enough". Oxygen isn't flammable because it doesn't burn in the presence of... itself. It's not flammable, it's the stuff that *makes everything else* flammable.
They start to absorb the air particles, dust, bacteria, and odors around them. Therefore, they lose their “fresh” scent.
Mass for sure and of course the number of each atom involved - as far as chemistry is concerned (ie no radioactive decay). So if the reaction starts with a mole of a certain atom, it will end with a mole of that atom (whether reacted or not).
When a women becomes pregnant, her body starts produced tons of hormones to prepare her body to sustain and carry the child. Some of these hormones will begin to collect in the woman's urine with days or weeks of fertilization. The tests work by triggering a two phase chemical reaction. The first reaction basically just detects water, that's the first, "not pregnant" line. The second stripe contains a chemical that changes color when it reacts with the hormones, but it takes more time. Think of it this way, there's a ton of water in pee so that's easy to detect, there's only a tiny bit of hormones so they're harder to find. So you'll always get that first stripe, if you don't it's a sign the test is defective. The second line, if it appears, takes a while because it's the part that's actually "doing something".
It's like the case with keeping a water in a pot to cool down but reversed. The surface water takes the heat and evaporates leaving behind colder water
It feels cold because it evaporates easily.@@@When the volatile liquids evaporate into a gas they pull a little heat from whatever surface they are in contact with. As a result when you touch acetone a small amount of it evaporates off stealing heat from your fingertip.
Water is indeed an exception. It's a very unusual molecule. The reason it's unusual is because of the very polar nature of water molecules: the electrons in the bonds are much more attracted to the oxygen than they are to the hydrogens, so the oxygen ends up with a partial negative charge and the hydrogens end up with partial positive charges. This means that water forms strong [hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond) between water molecules. These hydrogen bonds result in ice taking a very unusually open structure for a solid, and liquid water being unusually dense for such a light compound. The combination of the two lets water be slightly denser than ice, unlike almost all other known solids. Water is unusual in other ways, too: * Its highly polar nature makes it really good at dissolving other polar molecules.@@@* It's liquid at room temperature, unlike nearly every other light molecule, because the hydrogen bonds stick its molecules together. Compare CO2 (gaseous well below room temp) or ethanol (boils at 78C), both of which are much heavier molecules.@@@* It has very high surface tension, again because of the strong attraction between water molecules.
LiPO batteries have performance issues under 50° F (10° C) There’s a balance between temperature tolerance, recharge cycles, energy capacity, etc. Every chemistry has pros and cons.
It’s better to spray the cleanser upon the surface to be cleaned. The cleaning implement is absorbent. So applying cleanser unto it does not guarantee that all the applied cleanser will touch the surface to be cleaned. That amount of cleanser will be wasted.
You have hundreds of kinds of cells, many of which are found only in certain tissues.  Each cell has surface features (receptors) that respond to specific hormones, and these receptors differ between cell types.  Nowadays, a drug that does something to your kidneys (for example) consists in part of a key to some receptor that only kidney cells have; in other words, it disguises itself as a hormone that kidney cells expect, so kidney cells – and no other cells – let the drug in to do its thing. Disclaimer: not a biologist!
They can take the real food or whatever the flavor comes from and run it through a machine (mass spectrometer) that can tell them exactly what chemicals in the exact quantity’s the material has. Once they know the formula they can find other sources of those chemicals and combine them in the same formula.  It’s similar to a recipe used to cook food. It’s all about the materials used in the right portions.
that shouldn't be the case. can you outline the steps you took in your experiment?
Sometimes the coating on the pill protects what’s inside until they’re ready to be broken down in your stomach, liver etc. I know with Sertraline, for example, you can’t chew them or swallow them dry because if they stick in your throat and start to break down, the contents can damage it pretty badly.
Superglue contains cyanoacrylate which is an acrylic monomer. When this is exposed to air, it actually reacts with the moisture which causes it to form tight chains between the two surfaces once cured. Hope that helps.
Space time, space time, Einstein's theory of special relativity for it to work, space-time has to be a single fabric, Thus when you stretch or bend space, you are effecting time. For more detailed on how this "might" work, its way beyond anything reddit can provide.
To be able to see stars, it needs to be reasonably dark around you. To be able to see them well, it needs to be reasonably dark quite far away from you, as well. All of us folks who live a bit rurally know this already; you can see kind of where a city is if you look at the horizon, because even 20 miles away the sky will have a faint glow at night because of all the lights in the city. And that light, the light that helps us spot cities from quite a few miles away, that light is very much claiming it's space in a city. It comes from light sources that are not aimed right. Street lights that have poorly fitted reflectors. Lights in peoples windows that shine more out in the air than into the room. Car headlight. And so on. *Some* lights are deliberately aimed out into pitch dark air, such as lights that help aircraft navigate. But those are not really a big deal, compared to all the unnecessary lights of a city. The whole concept even got a name; light pollution. Light pollution makes it difficult, or even impossible, to distinguish stars on the night sky. Or makes it difficult to see...say... the Milky Way as a cloud of sorts behind many intense stars. This is one of many reasons why astronomers want to place their telescopes on plateau's in deserts in sparsely populated parts of the world. (there is more to it than that, but this bit definitely helps with the reasoning.)
Cannon is only used as a prop term. Basically what it is inside the barrel is a big piston. When the person climbs in the cannon they are standing on top of it. When it is "fired" it is just pushing the person up at a fast enough rate to launch them to the net or whatever they are aiming at not too terribly far away. Add in some pyrotechnics and smoke and noise and voila, you got yourself what appears to be a cannon shooting a circus performer. It would be similar to you standing on the seat of a seesaw, and your fat friend Kevin jumps from the top of the jungle gym onto the other end, launching you into a broken leg and a disappointed parent.
The ground is big. It's usually a reasonably good assumption that, no matter what us monkeys are doing above the surface, we can't pump enough electrons into or out of the ground to significantly affect the balance of electrons and protons— so the electric potential of the ground is always 0V. >And does everything have this special ability? Or a little of it? The special ability is bigness. Some things have more of it than others.
There are two main things happening in a star such as our sun, and they oppose each other. It's actually a really delicate balancing act. 1. The core of the star is fusing hydrogen into helium at an enormous rate. These fusion reactions produce vast amounts of heat and pressure, and that pressure means the core is constantly trying to expand -- just like when you heat water in a kettle, the steam tries to expand and get out of the kettle. 2. However a star is also really, really large. And even though gas is very light, there's enough of it in the outer layers of the sun that gravity is trying to squeeze all of those outer layers inward. So there's your balancing act: the core is trying to expand outwards, and the outer layers are trying to squeeze inwards. For much of its life a star like our sun will generally balance those two forces so that it appears as a more-or-less constantly shining object. But what happens if the nature of the atoms making up the star changes? As mentioned above the star shines because the core is fusing hydrogen atoms into helium atoms. There is enough hydrogen in the core for this to continue for a long, long time (billions of years). But eventually all the hydrogen will be used up, and so the sun's "fuel" will have gone. Your initial thought about this "well it's run out of fuel, so it will collapse" is actually correct. Initially the sun *will* start to contract when its hydrogen is used up. But as it contracts the pressure on the core gets greater (as all the "stuff" in the star is now compressed into a tighter area) and as the pressure goes up, so does the temperature. Quite quickly it reaches a temperature where it's hot enough to begin a different type of fusion reaction, this time fusing helium atoms into carbon and oxygen atoms. And of course there are a *lot* of helium atoms in the core by now, as the sun will have spent 12-13 billion years patiently converting all that hydrogen to helium. So, with a renewed even more powerful fusion reactor burning at its core once again, the outwards core pressure is more than enough to counteract the pressure of the collapsing star, and because the helium reaction releases more energy the outer layers of the star are pushed outwards. The star (our sun) will become much larger than it is at the moment due to this increased core pressure. But as it increases in size, the temperature of the outer layers cools. The star's colour changes from yellow-white to orange-red. The sun has become a red giant (and, incidentally, raised the temperature on earth way beyond anything that life could survive).
The units are a bit complicated, but 8.4 microSieverts per hour isn't something to worry about for short periods. I wouldn't hang out there, but I also wouldn't be worried about spending a significant amount of time there. Your normal dose of background radiation from living on the Earth is about 3 milli-Sieverts which is 3000 micro-Sieverts. You'd have to be in that area for a little over two weeks to pick up a year's worth of radiation, so a visit to pretend you're brave for being there isn't a significant dose.  Anyway, radiation units. There are two things to measure when it comes to radiation: exposure and dose. Exposure is the amount of radiation energy you absorbed. It's measured in Grays and one Gray is 1 Joule of radiation per kilogram. This is a tremendous amount of radiation and getting it all at once would give you pretty serious radiation sickness, but you'd probably survive. To make things more manageable we use milli-gray and micro-Grays.  That's not the whole story because different types of radiation will affect you differently. For example, absorbing 1 Gray of neutrons is 2-10 times more damaging to your cells than 1 Gray of gamma rays. The Sievert is just the Gray times that damage factor, so 1 Gray of gamma rays is 1 Sievert and 1 Gray of neutrons is 2-10 Sieverts.
JWT is a really sensitive *infrared* telescope. That means any source of heat can interfere with measurements. That includes the earth and moon. JWT is specifically orbiting a "Lagrange point". At Lagrange point 2, all the major heat sources (sun, earth, and moon) are always all on one side of the telescope. Then a heat shield on this side can block out any interference.
When water boils, it's getting so hot that parts of it are becoming a gas, pushing the rest of the water away and rising up in bubbles to escape as steam. As you heat a pot of water from the bottom, the bottom layers get hot enough to boil first. Bubbles of steam form and rise into the relatively cooler water. Here the steam cools and loses energy until it can no longer hold the water apart anymore to form a bubble. Suddenly the bubble collapses as the water slams down around it.   @@@This is the loud sound you hear, and it goes away once the water is heated throughout and the bubbles can pass through it to escape by popping more quietly at the surface.   @@@If you stir a pot of boiling water vigorously as it heats up, you can get rid of this loud phase of boiling.
On the contrary a moving vehicle will create a lot of dynamic forces in addition to the static force of its weight so it will cause more damage the faster it goes. You do sometimes see speed limits for trucks on bridges for this reason. And overweight cargo permits might also include special speed limits for certain bridges. In extreme cases you might see a very overweight truck crawl over a closed off bridge at walking pace to reduce the stress on the bridge.
It does tug on grains of sand a little. But grains of sand are very small. Even the ocean, which is less rigid than a grain of sand, deforms only by a matter of a meter or two on an ocean thousands of meters deep, and that kind of deformation isn't something you'd notice from a sand grain. But in fact, the solid Earth *does* bend with the tides too, it's just not visible on the scale of a grain of sand (and you don't notice it relative to structures because they bend the same way since they move along with their foundations). The ground [rises and falls by around a foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_tide) twice a day with the tides. It doesn't rise and fall as far as the ocean does because rock is, to put it mildly, better at holding its shape than water. But on these scales, rock is effectively a very thick liquid, and it does act like it for the purposes of the tides.
Simply put the salt makes it harder for water molecules to phase change to gas,  so it needs to be hotter to do so.
If you refer to "something" as the whole universe itself, the best answer we have summarizes to "if there was nothing, we couldn't observe it". That's the anthropomorphic principle. Arguably this answers "how do we know there is something rather than nothing?". The why sounds like it would be more meta physics or philosophy than actual physics...
Inertia is the tendency of things to keep the speed they have. You need a force to speed things up or slow them down. Momentum puts that to a numerical value. It's the velocity times mass. A force will slowly build up momentum in the direction it's pointing. And you will need the same Force×Time in the other direction to stop it again.
You have the strength to exceed the 9.8m/s2 of gravity’s pull.  You do it every day whenever you stand up or walk up a hill. You can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps because you're counteracting what you pull with by being pulled because you're attached to yourself.  You pull up with your arms by X Newton?  Your bootstraps pull back down by the same amount.  The net force on your total body is always 0 no matter how hard you pull.
It varies by gas. Nitrogen and oxygen are mostly captured from the air.  If you put air in a container and cool it, the first liquid that forms is nitrogen.  You put that in a tank and then warm it to gas for delivery to a nitrogen tank customer.  Oxygen is the next gas to condense, so that works the same way. Argon is also extracted from air. CO2 is made chemically, with Hydrogen, from air and natural gas.
Moisture can still condense on the inside of a bottle, even after you have consumed the contents.
The danger produced by MRIs when it comes to metal has to do with magnetism. Chances are your ring is not made of a magnetic substance, like gold, silver, or platinum.
Gravity is expressed as acceleration.  As long as you are accelerating, your mass experiences weight.  When you and your craft are no longer increasing in speed, but are traveling at the same speed, you experience apparent weightlessness.  Also, deceleration provides the same effect of weight, which is why you tug against the seat belts when braking hard.
We don't really perceive temperature. Instead, we perceive the rate at which hear enters or leaves our skin. When you touch a hard surface, it can feel "colder" because it's better at taking heat away from your skin than carpet
It doesn’t perfectly reflect all light. So if you stare long enough you can see the silver surface behind the reflection. If you look at it from an angle it’s even more obvious, since there’s less outside light to reflect. The same thing happens with a less reflective surface like a window or polished car. Except there so much light gets absorbed that you have to looks straight at the shiny surface in good light to see any reflection at all. And what you see is a more ghostly reflection that doesn’t obscure what’s behind the window or the color of the car.
The weak force doesn't make itself obvious to us in daily life, as do electromagnetism and gravity.  So we unfortunately can't build our intuition that way. To assess what the weak force "does", we'd attend to the initial conditions & final conditions before/after a weak-force-mediated particle process, and take inventory of everything: particle species that are present, their energies, and momenta, etc. That takes us closer to building intuition about the "effect" of the charged-current weak-force interactions: we tabulate the energies of the particles that are present before/after, and imagine how conservation of momentum and conservation of energy will divvy up the momentum and energy among the final particles.  We know we'll see some new particles, and they'll be leaving the interaction point at some different angles, with various energies. As you mentioned, the most interesting consequence of the charged-current weak force interactions is: it's the only force in nature that can change one kind of quark into another kind (allowing our sun's fusion processes, among other things).
Rocket engines produce *a lot* of thrust. For example, the Falcon Heavy produces 5.13 million pounds-force of thrust at lift-off.
When a car is moving at a fixed speed, it does not experience any force (besides gravity and the normal force from the ground). We're ignoring air because this is physics 101 and air does not exist. Thus, a car going 40 mph experiences the same force as a car going 60; zero. If you get *hit* by a car, you accelerate from zero speed to car speed in a fraction of a second, and the force on your body is thus tremendous. The car, likewise, decelerates slightly, as that force applies in both directions.
Yep.  It’s generally bad to be nearby a lightning strike in the water.  The water is pretty conductive, so decent amounts of current will spread out and zap the fish. If it didn’t work, the electric eels wouldn’t have figured out how to do it.
For an object to bounce, it has to absorb all of the energy of an impact in an elastic fashion. When you bend a spring a little bit, it will spring back after you let go. This is elastic deformation - it changes shape temporarily and it pushes in order to return to its normal shape. When you bend it a lot, it does not fully return to its original shape. This is *plastic* deformation. In plastic deformation, the energy put into bending the object becomes heat. In elastic deformation, the energy is returned to motion. Different materials and collisions experience different collision characteristics. A steel ball may bounce on a concrete floor in a gentle collision, but at higher speeds it will bounce much less, and a corresponding dent will form on the ball (or in the floor) where it hit. Worth realizing is that both the ball and the floor deform. A carpet deforms mostly in a plastic fashion, and so almost regardless of the ball, not much bouncing happens on carpet. Carpet is interesting because it is largely friction-driven. The fibers in the carpet rub up against one another and so friction prevents the collision from behaving elastically.
So it's not just the red shifting of light, but it's the rewinding of things.    @@@The idea is if you run things backwards, that would be the time at which everything is in a single point again.    @@@There's a lot of assumptions in that, but different methods all get about the same answer.
Yes. It melts slower when the surrounding temperature is closer to the ice cream’s temperature (colder).
Stellar-mass black holes are quite small, astronomically speaking. The supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies are the largest objects in the universe, but their formation mechanism is a bit of a mystery.  They’re *much* larger than any star could ever be, and many are much larger than even 13 billion years of sucking down space trash could muster.
When your home thermostat calls for cooling at, say 72 degrees F, your air conditioning unit is producing air that is 35 to 45 degrees F. You may feel that cold air circulating as it mixes with the air in the room to keep the room at your desired temperature. This is why some people run their system fan constantly, to keep the air moving and mixing.  Similarly, when heating a room to 72 degrees F, your forced air furnace is producing air at anywhere from 110 degrees F to 170 degrees F and sending it into your room.  Outdoors, the air heats and cools more or less uniformly in a given area.
Toss a pebble in a calm pond and watch what happens to the ripples over time. Sound's a lot like that. First you hear it as the ripples pass you. Then, if you're close enough to a fairly straight shore, you might hear it again as the ripples bounce back and pass under you a second time - this is an echo. Eventually the ripples spread out from each other so far that you can't see them (or in the case of sound, hear them). This can happen a lot faster if there's a slight breeze that's riffling the water, which is why background noise like the leaves on trees blowing in the wind makes it harder to hear distant sounds.
A color is based on the light that the material reflects. So if something reflects white, it is reflecting all the colors. If something reflects red, it is reflecting only the red wavelengths. But something that is black (or darker colors) is absorbing the majority of the light that is hitting it, so it doesn’t really reflect much color at all.  That’s why black things get hotter than white things in the sun, because the white is reflecting a lot of light, while the black is absorbing a lot of light. And when the light is absorbed, it is converted to heat.
An “atom” bomb is called that because it uses energy from splitting atoms to power it. Only specific types of atoms can split, release energy, and also cause additional atoms (of similar type) to also split, release energy, and continue the reaction. The atoms that can do this are called “fissile” (splittable) atoms, so not all atoms can be used in an atom bomb.
Two questions: why shouldn’t you, and why can’t you.  First, why shouldn’t you? Because you will crash your car, either by skidding or rolling. The car has a lot of momentum trying to move it forward and if you ask the tires so change direction too much and too quickly, they won’t be able to.  Secondly, why can’t you? Well, you can but it’s just harder. And it’s harder because cars are specifically designed to make it harder. Here’s a mini-history of power steering. In the beginning there was no power steering. The steering wheel was directly connected to the wheels, and it was quite hard to steer. When maneuvering at slow speeds where you wanted to turn the wheels a lot, it was really hard. You needed quite a lot of strength.  Then came power steering. When you turned the steering wheel, the car would detect it and help you turn. It became much easier to steer than before, particularly when you wanted to turn the wheels a lot.  However there was a problem at high speeds. It was so easy to turn that when to turned the wheel just a little bit, like you want at high speed, it felt like the steering wheel was just floating: there wasn’t enough control.  So they made adaptive power steering (or various other phrases for the same thing). It was designed so that at low speeds it would help you turn the steering wheel a lot, to allow you to maneuver easily, and at high speeds it would hardly help at all so you felt like you had control, and didn’t turn the wheels too much by mistake.
what kills you is the energy, which is volt x amp, besides, volt is like pressure between two points, a difference potential, and amp is like liquid flow, the energy flow, now, whatt/hour is like the amount of water that has flown and about the "n" big volts, half are lies and half have not enough energy flow to hurt you
No electrons don't move through the air. EM waves are actually carried by photons and visible light is a specific form of it (a specific frequency band) Electromagnetism are the forces caused by electrons. If I move an electron back and force it will propagate the forcefield around it in a waveform. Just like waving a piece of wood in water causes waves of pressure moving through the water. The wood stays where it is, but the force expands carried by a medium. And the EM field doesn't actually need a medium.
In the real world, air resistance is constantly slowing you down. The faster you go, the more fuel you need to maintain your speed because your acceleration needs to match the force of air resistance pushing against you.
You're hot. And if the air is standing still around you, you heat up that air and stay inside your own "warmth Bubble". So Wind takes that Bubble away and replaces it with room temperature which you have to warm up again (which steals warmth from you). It's the same when you blow on hot food to make it colder. You replace the layer of hot air with room temp which cools the food down.
As best we understand the physics, there is not a hard limit. However, the expansion is not strong enough to pull apart objects that are bound together by gravity or other forces, so as long as structures exist at all they'll be safe from the expansion of the Universe. That said, structures aren't totally eternal as we understand the cosmos today, and it is likely that in the very, very, very far future the Universe will consist of isolated particles (primarily photons) so distant from one another that none of them can observe any other. As for how - well, why *wouldn't* it be able to? It *already* stretched by a factor of untold billions just after the Big Bang, so in a sense we're already *in* a very, very stretched-out Universe.
What you're describing is a [hidden variable theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory). It's known that no such theory where the hidden information is local (that is, it's a property of the particles themselves that can't be communicated faster than light) can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics. So the only way you can get it to work is to assume faster-than-light communication between particles (or, if you prefer, some sort of underlying universal variable accessible by all particles no matter where they are, which amounts to the same thing).
Crystals are things that are reflective of their structure in 3 dimensions. The repeating patterns of the crystal are the same repeating patterns as the molecular make up. Time is another dimension akin to the spatial dimensions, so if you were to upscale from 3 dimensions to 4, adding time, you would have a regular repeating pattern through time. Hence, time crystal. As for how it could be used, that's interesting. You can't really extract work from them without violating the laws of thermodynamics (if change over time, like a repeating pattern is, is harnessable and taking place without some form of energy then the 'energy can neither be created nor destroyed' bit is gonna be an issue) so applications are uncertain.
It has to do with how the difference between how fast the thing is spinning and how fast your vision (or screen) updates.   If they are the same then then thing may look like it’s not spinning.  If  the thing is spinning slightly slower than the refresh rate of your vision then it may appear to be rotating backwards For example, a box fan seen on TV.   Let’s pretend you have a very old TV and it only refreshes the screen once a second (1 hz).  If the fan is also rotating at 1hz then the blades will be in the exact same position every time the TV snaps a picture.  They will do a full rotation in between TV image updates.   Now, if it’s slightly slower, sat 0.9hz then the fan will only complete 90% of one rotation in between snaps.   When comparing the two images it could appear that the fan actually rotated 10% in the other direction.
It'd totally depend on how they were killed. If they were vaporised then so too probably would be the bow and arrow. If they were hit by a really fast car then even if the arrow was released as they died chances are the impact would force its aim away from you. I'd say chances are that it'd miss or not even be released in a way that would allow it to travel far.
From my understanding wind is caused by the heating differences on earth. Heat rises@@@Cold lowers So as these differences interact it causes energy to build up and be expelled via wind
Air is flowing into the air canal and getting trapped without a way out. This creates a high pressure air bubble that all incoming air must go around, and actually reducing the amount of buffeted air that can reach your ear drum
Watts are "just" volts x amps. They are also the unit of "power" - how much total energy is being pushed through the circuit per second.
Our two eyes being a few centimeters apart gives us two slightly different 2D pictures which allows the brain to calculate the 3D shape from that difference. At large distances that difference becomes so minuscule that you only get the same 2D image twice and thus there is no 3D shape to calculate.
You have a giant block of metal generating tons of heat inside your hood. Your car's "heater" is just harnessing that engine heat and using dampers, fans, etc. to control how much of that hot air to allow into the cabin. As for the glass, you're gradually heating the glass and the glass is extra strong, tempered, laminated glass designed to withstand heat shifts, impacts, etc.
Huh? No. The slam would mean they're going *faster*, not slower. If you're asking "could you use friction to slow a fall" - well, yes, that's essentially what you're doing if you grab a handhold.
Power = torque * RPM.  At low RPM, most of the power goes towards just keeping the engine running. At midrange RPM, you are producing more power but your friction losses haven't really increased, so more of the torque gets out of the engine.  At very high RPM it gets harder to get the fuel and air into the engine fast enough to keep up with the piston, causing the torque to drop off.
You're partly wrong. You have the times correct,  but only for those instances. You could boil water faster or slower than 3 minutes; you can freeze water faster or slower than hours as well. It depends how much water and how fast or slow too. You can give the water energy or take energy away from it, and this can be done in different ways.
Current (amperage) (I) is the amount of charge particles that are moving. Those particles moving through your body (specifically the heart) is what kills you. Voltage (V) is the amount of force trying to move those particles. This is determined by the source of the electrical power (e.g. a *9-Volt* battery). There’s a fundamental relationship between current (I) and voltage (V): Ohm’s law. > V = I * R The “R” is resistance, or impedance, which represents how hard it is to move charged particles through something. Ohm’s law says that objects with high resistance (i.e. poor conductors) require more force to move charge particles through them. So the same force (voltage) can move fewer charged particles (current) through a poor conductor (high resistance) than through a good conductor (low resistance). Your body, and specifically your skin, has very high resistance (when dry). This means that, for a given voltage, current will be fairly low and thus not able to cause major harm. However, if you change the resistance all of a sudden by, say, accidentally cutting your skin or getting it wet, now that same voltage will generate a much larger current that can kill you. As an aside, there is such a thing as a *microshock*, which is when a tiny amount of current passes directly through the heart and disrupts it’s function. This can pretty much only happen during some kind of surgery where the heart muscles are directly exposed to a source of electricity.
Gravity. Most places rely on water towers.  They have two purposes.  They store water.  (So a pump can run at 100% to fill the tower up, then it can turn off, until needed.  This is what provides the water pressure.  To do this, water towers are often built on hills, and they are one of the tallest objects around.  So as long as your house is lower than the elevation of your water tower, gravity is ultimately pushing the water down, as overall the force of the water tower's drop is more than the elevation to the second floor of your house. And if you have a high rise building downtown, they just use pumps to push the water up.  But even then, they often have a storage tank on the top floor or roof.  So then gravity can provide the water pressure needed.
by definition of being "infinite" you dont assume it ends. what we understand as an "end" is the fact that you can only see so far with current technology: we call this border the "Observable Universe". @@@for all you know that the end,,,but we do not know because we cant see any further, that light hasnt reached us
A nuclear reactor uses radioactive materials as their fuel source. A chain reaction is started where neutrons slam into the other atoms which in turn also shoot off neutrons. But these neutrons are flying away at a high rate of speed, and they need to be slowed down a bit to make them more likely to hit another atom; this is where the moderator comes in. There are a few different things that can do this function, even just water. To control the reaction so they can make it happen more slowly over time instead of releasing all that insane energy at once, things such as control rods (which instead absorb neutrons instead of just slowing them down) are also put in the reactor. All this neutron whizzing about breaking other atoms like a cue ball on a pool table creates heat, crazy amounts of heat. This is captured via what is called the primary loop, which is water that is being circulated through the reactor both to help keep it cool and to collect that heat. This then goes to an exchanger where the primary water heats up secondary water (you don't want the primary water which is being exposed to neutron radiation to be outside the containment), and this secondary water gets turned into steam. This is what actually drives the steam turbines. Tldr: Nuclear reactions are atoms losing pieces that bump into other atoms and make them break up too, this makes shitloads of heat. The heat is collected and used for running a steam turbine.
Electrons and by extension atoms are technically theoretical since we cannot directly observe them. Through indirect observation (Milliken Oil Drop experiment, etc), we are able to conclude with near certainly that atoms and electrons exist.
Air is dry. Your skin is wet. Blowing air has lower pressure, so your skin water evaporates faster than in regular air, taking more heat with it.  You sense a cooling effect.
The centrifugal force generated when you a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel\_roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_roll) will be stronger than gravity so there is always a net force in the normal "down" in the aircraft so you can pour the liquid. If you would do a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileron\_roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileron_roll) that would not work It is fundamentally not any different to if you have water in a bucket and spin it around in a circle with your hand. The water will stay in the bucket.
Yes the weight is the factor. The design places all the force on a specific point on the blade with the extra weight giving it more “punching” power. Late Medieval knights started carrying maces and axes only using swords as status or ceremonial weapons as they were ineffective against plate armor of the time.
Current flows through all available paths all the time. The one with the least resistance will naturally have the most current flowing through it. In the case of, say, a person, their resistance is either *way* lower or *way* higher than the alternative, so the "path of least resistance" is a decent way to predict where most current will go. However, that's in conductors and resistors. Insulators experience something called breakdown, where enough current will cause a sudden huge drop in resistance. This is what arcing is through air. It means that the path with marginally less resistance almost instantly becomes the path of *way* less resistance when enough voltage is applied.
It’s about angular momentum: when the arms work like pendulums they limit the direction of motion.  That way, the legs can focus on acceleration instead of stabilization.
As water gets hotter, its viscosity becomes lower. The change is enough to make the sounds distinct. Same mechanism as with engine oil. Starting your car on a cold day can sometimes cause unexpected problems because the cool lubricant is thicker and has to warm up before it works as intended.
When things freeze, the process depends not only on how cold it is, but also if there's a good spot for the ice crystals to start forming. Good spots for the freezing to start are things like sharp deformations in the container, or places where the liquid has been disturbed by stirring or shaking. It's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle: it gets easier if you start with the edge pieces. So when a can of beer is sitting stationary in the freezer in a clean, smooth can, there's not a lot of good spots for the ice crystals to start forming. This lets it cool a bit below its freezing point before it starts to freeze. When you pour the beer, you create good spots for it to freeze by disturbing the beer in the process of pouring it into the glass and getting everything all shaken up. Once a few ice crystals start to form the whole beer can start freezing. The same thing happens with boiling. If you microwave water in a very clean glass, you can get it above the boiling point without it boiling. If you shake the glass or poke the surface with a spoon it will suddenly start boiling, which can be dangerous if you aren't expecting it. It's a similar issue except that it needs good spots for the bubbles to form rather than the ice crystals.
Light has no mass, but it does have *momentum* and momentum is conserved! So when a photon bounces off the mirrored sail, the sail must have some change in momentum for the momentum of the sail and photon together to be the same after the photon hits the sail as it was before! In more detail, but less ELI**5**: @@@Classical momentum requires mass, but that’s only a partial description and relativity gives a fuller picture. Recall the famous equation E = m c^2 ? That’s only part of the full equation, which reads: E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2 , where p is momentum. Since light has no mass, we can re-write this as: E = p c, so for a photon with  E = h c / l, where h is the Planck constant and l is the light’s wavelength, we can combine this with the above to give: p = h / l. So a smaller wavelength (bluer) photon carries more momentum!
From a physics perspective, heat is energy that is transferred from one body to another. Ie. from the warmer body to the colder body. Just think about an ice cube. If you put an ice cube in a warm room, heat is the energy transferred from the warm room into the ice cube, raising its temperature and causing it to melt. If you put a glass of water in a cold room, heat is the energy transferred from the water into the cold room, lowering the water's temperature until the water turns to ice. So how does that affect your body? All living organisms are essentially a symphony of complex chemistry. You're alive because many, many complex chemical reactions are constantly happening in your body. A simple example, when you digest your food, enzymes produced by your body are helping to break down your food in a series of chemical reactions. And you might remember from chemistry class that temperature can greatly affect chemical reactions. Those digestive enzymes don't work if your body is too cold and they might actually break down if your body is too hot. That's why cold-blooded animals like lizards have to warm up in the sun to reach the right temperature to digest their food. And warm-blooded animals like yourself produce their own heat and carefully regulate their body temperature to stay at the optimal temperature for their body chemistry to work. As a warm-blooded creature. Your body produces heat to stay at the perfect operating temperature. And you also attempt to cool down when you get too hot. For example, by sweating and by vascular dilation, ie. your blood vessels near the surface widen so you can radiate the excess heat in your blood. That's why you turn red when you're too hot. When circumstances make it impossible to manage your body heat properly, for example because you're in an environment that is far too cold or far too hot, you start to suffer the consequences. Hypothermia and hyperthermia are collective descriptions for the various ways you can suffer the consequences of heat or cold messing up your body's temperature management. Potentially fatally so.
From what I know it’s buffering. Like a transfer of air in and out. With one opening it’s fighting against the air rushing in and out. Creating the chopper sound. With the Second window open it allows the air a path to escape so it flows through the other window and not back out where it came in.
Your parents created you, inside the Universe.  The closed timelike curvature required to make a temporal causality loop is at best theoretical.  More likely, it's disallowed by the Universe.  You can theorize moving through space at any speed, but the speed of light is a hard limit enforced by the Universe.
Water is significantly better at absorbing and dissipating heat than air is. In fact, room temperature air loses heat around 43 times faster than water does. It also has a much higher heat capacity, which is the energy required to raise the temperature of the material by one degree. This means water can absorb a massive amount of energy from your skin, and only increase in temperature a very small amount. @@@ @@@When submerging your hand in water, it is much more efficient at pulling heat from your body than air is. Your skin cools to the temperature of the water, whereas still air cannot retain enough heat to be able to cool your skin down to ambient temperature like water does. This is why water always feels cooler than air.
Conservation of angular momentum. In a dust and hydrogen cloud all the particles are moving in basically every direction. But they don't perfectly cancel each other out, and as gravity pulls the cloud together until (if there's enough mass) a star forms, the imbalance in directions all those particles and molecules are moving form the spin. Repeat for everything at every scale
To accelerate yourself up, you need to push something else down. When you're standing on the ground that's pretty easy, but when you're in midair you only have the air and whatever you carried up with you.  You can jump just fine as long as you have something to push against.
Idk why this is flagged, this isn't speculation, there's a definitive answer.  The universe is huge. The universe has always been huge. We can already see light this old (it's called the cosmic microwave background),  although JWST will give us the best view we've ever had. The light is very old, because it's been traveling a very long time, because it started very far away. When the light was emitted, the things emitting that light were billions of light years away from the things that eventually became Earth (although not 13.5 billion light years, because of space expanding and relativity). The universe probably didn't begin as an infinitely dense point. The big bang was the universe expanding from everywhere all at the same time.
I found entropy very difficult to grasp in the first year of my chemistry undergrad - it really only clicked when I heard this explanation:@@@Picture a container that contains 4 marbles. Think about the amount of different positions these marbles can take, a marble could be located in each of the bottom four corners, or they could also be in the top four corners or in several different positions. Now let’s increase the size/volume of this container. This would mean that these four marbles can take more positions, right? This is precisely what entropy is: molecules having the opportunity to take various positions within a given space. The greater the amount of rearrangements, the higher the entropy. So now let’s conclude with another example, let’s say you put a rubber ball in the oven, turn the heat on and the ball shrinks…. Now that the ball is smaller in this oven (because it has shrunk) do you think the entropy of that system will be higher or lower….. well it can take more rearrangements right, because the ball is smaller and the oven is the same size…. So the entropy is higher. @@@When talking about the different states of matter (solids, liquids and gas) - solids are more ordered, the particles are closer together and are less likely to take more positions (thereby reducing the amount of possible arrangements in a given volume). Gas particles are spread further apart and can assume more arrangement in a given volume, hence, a gas of the same molecule will have a higher entropy compared to the solid of that molecule.
It wouldn't spoil as it would be immediately dried since water boils at any temperature at such low pressures. (And with neither water nor oxygen available bacteria have a hard time) It wouldn't last forever though, it gets bombarded by radiation until it's molecules fall apart (how long that would take is hard to tell though)
Objects aren't perfectly smooth, the surface has ridges and valleys. This causes objects to basically get "stuck" one each other. which generates a force that resists the direction of motion. We call this friction.
You mean how do single-cell organisms, or for that matter, enzymes restructure molecules? it's all about patterns. molecule: "In my left hand i got a key. i don't know what for, and i don't really like it that much." enzymes: "hey, you, molecule passing by with that sweet set of ... keys. I got a matching keyhole. come here" molecule: "ooaaahh shieeewtt, noiice, lets go" enzymes: "haha jinks, i just cut off your arm. but don't worry. try grabbing the remains of your left arm with your right hand. trust me." molecule: "you fucked up SOB, this is so awesome." enzyme: "no problem. \*speaking to different molecule\*: hey, i got an arm. you want it!!" &#x200B; chemist Explanation: enzymes break molecular structures by having stronger binding agents.  this is only true for a small portion of enzymes. there are a lot more ways to change molecule structures than just "ripping off an arm". but this was the most entertaining to myself
The gap between room temperature and hot things is higher than the gap between room temperature and cold things. For example, for a room temp of 20 C / 68 F, a cold item near freezing (5 C / 41 F) is only 15 degrees C / 27 degrees F colder than the room. On the other hand, to stay food safe, a hot item needs to be above about 60 C / 140 F, which is 40 degrees C / 72 degrees F hotter than the room. The other reason is that vacuum flasks work by preventing *conductive* heat transfer (because there's nothing to conduct through). But they can't stop *radiative* transfer, caused by warm objects emitting small amounts of radiation (at human temperatures, typically infrared). That radiation scales up very quickly with temperature: while conductive transfer goes at a speed proportional to the difference in temperatures, *radiative* transfer goes at a speed proportional to the difference *of the fourth power* of temperature measured in Kelvin. Flasks are silvered (covered with reflective metals) to limit this effect, but radiative transfer scales so strongly that very hot contents can overcome it.
Wave particle duality is actually fairly well understood and described by quantum mechanics, it’s only a problem for classical mechanics to describe. Under basic quantum mechanics the fundamental object is the wavefunction, which can either be more localised (particle like) or less (wavelike).
Electrons have weight and mass, but electric*ity* isn't quite the same as electrons. Electricity is the movement of electrons. So your question is a bit like like asking "does sound have weight?" Like, air has weight, but maybe the vibrations *of* the air don't count as having weight.
They can steer their engines (or at least some of them if they have multiple). This is called “gimballing” if they move the whole engine, named for the mechanical support that lets you do it. Otherwise they use a variety of tricks inside the nozzle to redirect the thrust.  But no matter how you slice it, they’ve got a steerable component back there to keep things going straight.
It is not about how fast you are going, but how fast you are stopping. Acceleration (or deceleration) matters not speed. If you come to a full stop from 10, 50 or 100 mph in the same short amount of time obviously the 100 mph will mean you decelerate much harder, but if you take more time slowing down from a high speed that might be safer than to come to an abrupt stop from a slower speed. Cars crumple zones, air bags and other safety features are all designed to spread out the time it takes for you (more specifically your head) to come to a full stop. You can jump from several stories high into water with little ill effect, but simply falling flat on your face from onto concrete standing upright might seriously injure or even kill you. The water slows you down over a bit of time when you hit it, the concrete slows you down all at once. When you drive your car into a tree or wall that can be sudden even at slow speeds. (Even with all the safety features trying to help you). If you ski at high speeds into a tree that can be pretty deadly. If you ski and fall over and then spend several seconds and quite a bit of space to come to a full stop that is much less of an issue. Wearing a helmet, warm clothing and falling onto relatively soft snow helps a lot. It is all about how quickly you come to a stop, the longer it takes to slow down to stop the healthier.
Gamma, alongside other forms of ionizing radiation (x-rays, alpha, beta, and neutron), is dangerous because when it impacts matter it has enough energy to strip electrons off of atoms. Since the bonds of electrons are what hold molecules together, this splits molecules apart too. While this usually doesn't do any quick damage to large structures with many molecules, it can still cause wear, with the most common example being the embrittlement of plastics in sunlight. In the human body, this means that important cellular parts like your DNA get shredded by little gamma ray bullets, and so they stop doing their jobs. In the short term, this means your cells die and you get ill or die. If you survive acute exposure, other damage such as DNA damage can show up later on in life.
It’s to do with quantum mechanics and how he operates on a plane of time and space that us mortals can’t yet comprehend
It's not "split into two smaller packets", if that's what you're asking. The single packet is smeared out, passes through both slits, and continues to smear out in an interference pattern beyond them. All of that is "one photon".
He didn't... the existence of Atoms was theorized in 1827 by Robert Brown. What Einstein did was propose methods of measuring their size. "[It was Albert Einstein who, starting in his epochal year of 1905, published several papers that explained precisely how Brownian motion could be used to measure the size of atoms and molecules. (In 1905 Einstein created special relativity, proposed photons as quanta of EM radiation, and produced a theory of Brownian motion that allowed the size of atoms to be determined. All of this was done in his spare time, since he worked days as a patent examiner. Any one of these very basic works could have been the crowning achievement of an entire career—yet Einstein did even more in later years.) Their sizes were only approximately known to be 10−10 m, based on a comparison of latent heat of vaporization and surface tension made in about 1805 by Thomas Young of double-slit fame and the famous astronomer and mathematician Simon Laplace.](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/physics/chapter/30-1-discovery-of-the-atom/)"
It adds its weight to the weight of the water in the pool. Ie. A scale at the bottom of the water container would increase by the weight of the added mass. @@@But a common ”trick” question is: if a rock is in a boat floating in the pool and you drop the rock to the bottom of pool from boat, does the water level go up or down? (A: Water level goes down, because in the floting boat the rock displaced water equal to its weight, but in the bottom it displaces only its own volume of water which is a smaller amount.
Mythbusters tested this a long time ago. If it's genuinely shot *straight up*, then when it reaches its maximum height, it comes to a complete stop in the air. It loses its flying profile, and on the way down it will tumble and fall... not harmlessly, but its maximum speed on the way down will be much lower than it would be. I wouldn't want to be hit by it, but I think you'd survive especially if you had any half-decent helmet. If it were shot upwards but at an angle, a bullet can retain its flight profile when it reaches its peak and come back down as a deadly projectile, still pointy side first. There are documented cases of people being hit and killed from large distances when someone fired a gun into the air. Mythbusters called it busted, confirmed, and plausible all at the same time, since they had evidence of it actually killing someone, but also "straight up" is actually a hard thing to do for a human just pointing a gun upwards and firing. Shooting a gun "straight up" probably wouldn't be fatal, but you probably aren't actually going to do it that way in the first place.
The other common method is the shaker machine at hardware stores. It takes a good amount of time Because there's so little pigment to so much base, that you have to put a lot of mixing in to ensure that that little amount of pigment has gotten around that whole gallon bucket. The viscosity and small amount of empty room to move around inside the can also contribute to this, yes. It would probably be better if the pigment actively dissolved into it like food coloring does with say water, but the reality is the paint is just a carrier for the pigment.
Gravity is a fundamental force, as far as we know there's no "why". It just is. All matter with mass experiences an attractive force towards other matter with mass (or, all mass warps spacetime, if you're Einstein).
Airline pilot here: As someone else said, it's a regulatory loophole. I assume you were on some sort of regional jet, EMB175, CRJ 700/900, etc. Since you said "below', as the EMB145,l and CRJ 200 are 'behind', and larger aircraft are almost never affected by this situation. Bags put in the cargo area count as baggage weight, while carry-on bags are included in an average passenger weight. The average passenger weight just got increased at our airline, and it's reviewed periodically. The overall weight of the aircraft has to be below a certain weight for the expected runway of use. At large airport, there's usually a long runway available for takeoff that will allow for heavier weights. At smaller airports, there's just one runway for the prevailing wind, and that's more limiting. Reason why might be accelerate/stop distance (V1), obstacle climb necessities, airport altitude, and some other more obscure performance issues. Hope that helps. edit: you didn't say 'below' , so it coud've been any of them. edit 2: Gold? Aww shucks, guys and gals!
Why questions aren't actually really answerable in science.  They actually don't make sense.  How It just does.  That is what mass in spacetime does to spacetime.  That is just how the universe works.  It used to be said that gravity was a force and so scientists looked for a particle to transfer it but no such particle has ever been found.  It has scientists quite stumped.
The light might be mostly UV, but you can't really tell how much UV is seeping out.  The sticker has orange fluorescent pigment, which can be charged up my any short wavelength light.  UV provides the most dramatic effect, as it doesn't illuminate the surroundings, but it seems blue is good enough.
They are created. They appear. Such things are not super uncommon in high-energy physics. Photons require much less energy to form than most particles, so they form much more easily. Something like an electron-positron pair can form under sufficiently strong electric fields, while a proton-antiproton pair would require *way* higher fields.
Time is the distance between events, just like space is the distance between objects.  Nothing can experience time backwards.
Both. There isn't a fixed radius of "badness" around it. It's not like some discrete bubble around the material where on the inside of the bubble you get fried and on the outside nothing happens. There's just less radiation the further away you get. If you have twice as much radioactive material, you'll get twice the dose of radiation up close, and also twice the dose 10m away, and 50m away and 1km away.
If you weigh 99 pounds and eat one pound of carrots, you are 1% carrot. If you weigh 99 kilograms and eat one kilogram of carrots, you are 1% carrot. There's nothing contradictory about those two statements, and the framing of the question makes me think you have some serious misconception about how percentages work.
You absolutely can reflect radio waves - that's how a [dish antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_antenna) works, by reflecting all the incoming radio waves to one point at the center of the antenna.
Everything is made of atoms. The outer edges of atoms are made of particles called electrons. Each atom has specific numbers of electrons. If it has more or fewer electrons than it's "supposed" to, it's called an "ion". Since ions have the "wrong" number of electrons, they really want to get back to the "right" number. If an atom has too many electrons we say it has a "positive charge". If it has too few we say it has a "negative" charge.  You know how magnets have a North and South pole? That's really just nicer words to describe negative and positive charges. Things with opposite charges attract each other because they want to trade electrons and get back to having no charge.  When you rub certain materials against each other, one of them tends to lose electrons to the other. That puts a positive charge on one and a negative charge on the other. Now they attract. We say that either object has "static electricity" because they keep their charge until they touch something.  If a thing has a strong enough charge and you move it close to your wall, it sticks because even though the wall has atoms with electrons that are "right", the charged object pulls on those atoms and tries to take their electrons away. Eventually it succeeds and the difference in charge between your wall and the object lessens, so the object falls off the wall. This doesn't permanently charge your wall because the wall is BIG and also connected to the ground. If the wall has a charge, it pushes or pulls electrons from the ground until it doesn't. You'd have to have a magic, floating house for it to accumulate and keep a static charge! (Or your house would have to be built specifically to prevent electrical charges from reaching the ground, but this is very dangerous.)
So you and the car are moving at the same speed. The car then suddenly decelerates. You try to keep moving and end up being stopped from going through the windshield with your seat belt. When the seat belt stops you all of the tissues of your body rush forward, around the seat belt when possible. All of these stretchy soft tissues of your body have now been stretched. All that kinetic energy is turned into potential energy in the stretched tissues. Like a spring they recoil. That potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy but the arrow is pointed in the opposite direction back towards the driver's seat.  For a bonus, secondary impacts can also drive the car forward again if it's not a single car against obstruction kind of crash . But simply put, you bounce off your seat belt or the dashboard just like anything else bounces. The whole point of the seat belt is to give you a much larger surface area than the face and knee caps, against which to bounce. Seat belts also have a little more give in them than a nice hard steering wheel of yesteryear so they can soften the impact a little bit. EDIT :: I forgot about the secondary effect. Depending on how the crash takes place the nose of the car may dip as back end rises. As the car tilts up A lot of the crash energy may be converted from kinetic to potential energy as the weight of the car is levered up on the front obstruction. When the rear end goes back down the net leverage is to shove your body like The seat belt is a tiny little trebuchet. So the movement of the car up and then back down again can actually catch you and throw you back where you came from... Which is into the seat. So it is desperately important that when you sit down in any car with headrests you should lift or lower the headrest so that the center of the back of your head is lined up with the center of the headrest when you push back a little. That way there's something to catch your head rather than simply catching your neck and letting your head pivot backwards and stretch your spine and neck.
Imagine hitting middle C on a piano. It produces a soundwave that oscillates at approximately 264 hertz, as well as some other waves that are multiples or fractions of 264 hertz. That means your ear is hearing a wave of air vibrating 264 times per second. Imagine hitting middle C over and over again while someone is speaking. Your brain can tell the difference between the piano note and the person's voice, but your ear is just picking up the vibrations in the air... in other words, it's the software, not the hardware, that your brain uses to distinguish the different sounds that you're hearing at once. All that a speaker has to do is vibrate at the right frequency, which is essentially adding up the waves from each individual instrument in the recording. That will make your ear vibrate at the right frequency, and your brain can figure out what parts of the sound are the drums, the bass, the guitar, the vocals...
Noise is air vibrations. Vibrations take energy.  Think of solid matter as points connected by springs. The stiffer the spring, the more energy it takes to deform. But those "springs" will also release more energy when allowed to return to normal. Therefore, a stiffer material will create more noise because it is releasing more energy into the air as vibrations.
>But... this should only push the car forwards. Where is it getting the force thats pushing it sideways from? They *are* pushing the car "forwards." But, because the front wheels are turned, what constitutes "forwards" is always changing. Basically, the back wheels are moving fast enough, and the front wheels are turned sharp enough, that the there is basically a "lag" between the back wheels wanting to go where the front wheels are pointed. So the back wheels push the back of the car forward, but the front wheels move the front of the car in a different direction, meaning the back of the car is now moving around that pivot point.
> so I've heard that the universe (or everything in it) moves at the speed of light by default This is a common misunderstanding of special relativity and its concept of 4-speed. 4-speed is the spacetime equivalent of normal speed (or 3-speed); it tells you how fast something is moving in spacetime (so space *and* time), and has to be the same from the perspective of all inertial observers (the basic thing we want for SR). But the only speed-like thing that is the same for all inertial observers is *c* (the "speed of light," "local speed limit" or "universal invariant speed"), so the 4-speed is going to have to be *c* by definition (the maths works out that way as well). But this doesn't really tell us anything useful. And it isn't *c* in the sense of the 3-speed of light we normally think about, but a 4-speed. It is a subtly different thing. It also isn't just the sum of the 3-speed and time-speed, but is closer to the difference between them. In general there is no such thing as absolute speed (other than *c*). Motion (without acceleration) is always relative to someone else - you can always find a point of view where something is still (for example, from your point of view *you* are always stopped).
We're pretty confident about the history of the universe back until about a picosecond after what is commonly referred to as the big bang - that's 0.000000000001 seconds (more or less).  Before that point in time, the entire universe was about a million billion billion times smaller than the size of a single atom.  At this scale, our understanding of general relativity (the rules that seem to dictate how the universe as a whole and the big things in it act) comes into direct and unavoidable conflict with our understanding of quantum mechanics (the rules that seem to dictate how very, very small things act).  We know that neither is correct when applied to densities of stuff (matter and energy) that comprise the entire universe stuffed down into a size smaller than nearly anything we can imagine.  In a certain sense, the math just doesn't work - we end up "dividing by zero" in both a literal and metaphorical sense, and our math doesn't permit that.
Tesla coils are a kind of circuit designed to generate very strong radio frequency signals. The result is high voltages in the nearby air, which can cause some gases with low ionization energies to become a plasma (where their electrons are ripped free), and when the electrons fall back down they glow.
The sharper, more chaotic, and more violent sounds are the rounds impacting the target. The mechanical and consistent "brrrrt" sound is the actual sound of the weapon firing. You hear them as separate events because the bullets are traveling much faster than the speed of sound. Of note, you get similar effects from rotary weapons on [other aircraft;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjYz_pY7-Ms) it's not unique to the A-10 and the GAU-8. The A-10 is just more widely known and more recognizable because the GAU-8 is larger and louder, and is almost exclusively used for ground attack, particularly across the Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq wars where a lot of this footage originates from.
Interaction is a very broad term. When two particles interact it means they have an effect on each other, there are lots of different ways this can happen but perhaps the simplest is that of two particles with the same charge repelling each other.  When two electrons exist near each other they repel, this interaction is due to the electromagnetic force. When an electron and a proton are near each other their interaction is attractive rather than repulsive as they have opposite charges.  There are also more complex interactions where particles are converted into different types, when an electron and a positron (antimatter counterpart of an electron) interact they annihilate and two photons are released. Similarly two photons can interact to generate a positron and electron.
It's basically just like... light.  You know how light gets redder as the wavelength increases? @@@If you keep going, eventually you get radio waves. We just can't see it at that point.
There’s a subtlety here, particles of EM radiation (photons) aren’t physically vibrating up and down. EM waves are just that, waves in the electromagnetic field. They might induce vibrations but they themselves don’t oscillate up and down.  For mechanical wave motion like sound passing through a solid it comes about from interactions with neighbouring particles. Think about atoms in a material as a long string of particles connected by springs (representing inter particle forces), if you displace one of these particles upwards and let it go then it will be pulled back in line by these forces from neighbouring particles. Newton’s third law tells us that every force has an equal reaction, the neighbouring particles get displaced up as they pull the original one down. Now you have more particles which are displaced up, they get pulled back down by their neighbours which get pulled up and so on. The original displacement travels along the material as a wave of up and down movement.
We're tracking literally millions of orbiting objects ranging from tiny shrapnel to massive defunct satellites.  The ISS station has something called whipple shielding. It kinda looks like your video card's heatsink. Lots of thin little ridges. Space debris is moving so fast that it normally breaks up on impact, often even turning into molten material or even plasma. Whipple shielding's initial layer is very thin and it won't stop an impact by itself. But it will cause debris to break up on that initial impact. This causes the resulting hit to be spread out over a much larger area which the whipple shielding can protect against. At the same time, the fact that we track so much debris also means the station often just moves out of the way. If there's even a 1 in 10.000 chance of an impact, they just move the station slightly so the tracked debris flies by. And occasionally they just get hit. Earlier this year debris hit and damaged the robot arm hanging off the station for instance and it took a space walk to fix it. [Kurzgesagt has a nice video on just how problematic orbital debris is in the long run.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS1ibDImAYU)
A principle known as induction. The wireless charger contains a coil. When electricity passes through this coil it creates an electromagnetic field. A special device inside your phone called a rectifier interacts with the electromagnetic field and converts it into electricity that is then used to charge the battery. The conversion comes with a bit of loss due to heat, around 90% - 92% efficient compared to wired charging, and it's slower.
It definitely can be done.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor The problem is to get more energy out than you put in, after allowing for losses from radiation, ions hitting something, etc., so you can have a sustainable reaction.@@@(And, beyond that, to get enough salable energy out to *pay* for everything you put in.)
Objects on the Planck scale already break "conventional physics". So if you had a photon with a wavelength on that scale, you'd break the physics too. People are working on ways of rectifying that issue. It's honestly not a huge deal that something can "break conventional physics". Things have done that in the past, and we've gotten through them. All it means is that our models are incomplete in some way.
You can't receive useful information faster than light, for the simple reason trying to decipher it will erase it. If you detect a righty particle, you will know the entangled twin is lefty, but no one else will know unless you tell them about the righty one. If a friend attempted to measure the entangled lefty twin, the entanglement would break and the result would be scrambled. The friend would have to ask you if they got it right. Which takes us right back at the speed of light again. Measurement and interference breaks entanglement. In quantum mechanics we say it undergoes decoherence. It means the particle becomes part of the quantum system that measured it. EliannaRys' answer is probably better.
It's easier that way. We would have to change a bunch of equations and spawn a lot of confusion. For instance, do we reverse the direction of magnetic fields, too? Or do we make a bunch of our equations negative? Do we just flip the charge of electrons and call it positive? And why? Nobody who actually needs to know the difference gets this confused, and for most people it really doesn't matter.
Color temperatures go red->orange->yellow->white->blue. It could become blue hot if you mad it much much hotter. But in practice you can't make iron hot enough to be blue hot. 6500 K is "standard white" (color of sunlight). You'd need to make it around 8000 K hot to be blue.  @@@Iron **boils** at around 3000 K.  @@@Even tungsten boils at around 5700 K.   So any metal you could be heating up would boil away before it became blue hot.
Why not ask her and let her explain them to you on your date?
That doesn't exist. Something does just not travel "with an amount of force". You can accelerate something with a certain amount of force for some time, and it will have a set velocity afterwards. But the mass of the object and the acceleration time also play a role.
Everything is constantly reflecting light that falls on it, in all directions. The thing about mirrors is that they reflect light at the same angle it came in without jumbling it up. For example if you have light coming in perpendicular to the mirror face then it will reflect perpendicular as well. If it is coming in at a 45 degree angle then it will bounce off at a 45 degree angle. This is always happening; the mirror isn't changing as you shift your angle, you are just moving into a position where you can see what it was always reflecting.
