For the same reason you can’t ban free speech.  It is a constitutional freedom that was designed to be difficult dismantle.
In most cases, employees do not get access to many of the company's benefits, such as accruing vacation/sick leave, retirement plan contributions, or other perks. So it's less about having an "out" for the company to let go an unsatisfactory employee, but saving money on them by not giving them full compensation till they "prove" themselves.
To some degree, those are synonyms. Loosely but not in any strict legal sense, “illegal” more often refers to an action that constitutes a crime — a violation of the law that can subject the actor to criminal prosecution by the government, leading to a conviction, a criminal record, and potentially a custodial sentence. Loosely but not in any strict legal sense, “unlawful” more often refers to an action that constitutes any contravention of any law, even if that contravention of the law cannot lead to criminal penalties. Some common examples of something unlawful but not criminal might include committing a civil wrong against a person (say, breaking your lease), or being late in paying a fine, or remaining in the country without legal status. When the government itself fails to comply with a statute or regulation, that too is more likely to be termed “unlawful” than “illegal.”
Brittany Spears was an extremely famous pop music star in the early 2000's. She was a child who grew up in the entertainment industry was a chart topper for many years as a solo artist. In the mid 2000's she began a series of erratic behavior such as a questionable marriage and highly publicized emotional breakdowns. As a result her parents were able to get a court order that essentially removed her ability to control her own life/free will. In this legal process her ability to chose where/when how to live, work, spend her money; basically many any independent choices were removed from her. In a sense she is a slave to her legal guardians.  She has recently begun a highly publicized legal attempt to have these guard rails removed from her life and basically become a normal person again.
Proving that horses exist is easy, just find a horse. But how would you prove that unicorns don't exist? Even if you check everywhere, and don't see one, there is always a chance that you just missed it. There will always be that possibility.
If you’ve committed multiple crimes that each carry a life sentence, receiving multiple life sentences is a symbolic way to ensure “fairness” to the victims; you’re being punished for every crime you committed.
That only works if the people to whom you are snitching are all benevolent and their punishments are fair. Most criminal justice systems are still rife with abuses of power and systemic racism. A lot of crimes are directly a result of people being forced to live in systems of oppression. Many gangs were originally created to protect communities that were being either brutalized or ignored by law enforcement. A lot of drug dealers say they got into dealing because it was the only way they could imagine making enough money to buy nice things and provide for their families.     In the US, the prison population is predominantly BIPOC and low-income, meaning they've experienced a lot of oppression before they entered. They may not have had access to adequate legal representation because our public defenders are criminally overworked. They're exploited for free or cheap labor (watch the 13th by Ava Duvernay), and they leave in debt and a record that will disqualify them from some jobs and housing and come up in background checks for those that are available.     So, for a lot of incarcerated people, snitching is not going to protect people. It is going to serve the oppressors and offer up another person to be abused by the system. Even if you hate the "bad guy," you may not want to see him fucked over by your greater enemy.     Also, there's a long history of "jailhouse snitches" who lied. Sometimes they make up whatever they think will get them the best deal (usually years off their sentence), and sometimes law enforcement purposefully houses a snitch with someone awaiting trial so that they can get a "confession."

I live in a fairly small Midwestern town, I’ve worked with the police here doing some media work for them. They often joke the only time they ever have to call for “shots fired” is when a dear gets hit and they have to use a shotgun to put it down. I’d imagine the chances are higher in bigger cities, but it smaller towns it’s almost unheard of.
A person is not on trial for being guilty of a crime, they are on trial for being accused of a crime.
It's the experience of losing track of your sense of self, typically in the context of using a psychedelic drug, but also potentially during intense meditation. The Ego in this context is the Freudian concept of the Id, Ego, and Superego.  The Id operates in the subconscious - it's your instincts, your desire to feel pleasure, your primitive drive to survive.  The Ego is your sense of self, your self-esteem, your conscious decision making ability, your experience of reality.  The Superego is like your conscience - it's where morality, guilt and anxiety come from. So, an ego death is a detachment from reality and from your sense of self.
It depends, but federal employees are not prosecutable in state court when they are performing their federal government duties.  This isn't striking down the law, but rather striking down prosecutions under state law. Others have covered the "unconstitutional state law" case.
In general there are a number of "purposes' for incarceration: 1. Deterrence 2. Rehabilitation 3. Punishment 4. Segregating dangerous elements from society Depending on the culture of your particular government and nation, any one of these can be focused more than others. In the US in particular, starting in the 70s and ramping up in the 90s, there was a cultural and political shift from focusing on rehabilitation to punishment. Basically, many people asked the same question as you, implying that current rehabilitative methods weren't working, so we might as well just punish them. Currently the focus isn't in deterring people or preventing recidivism (continuing to commit crimes after being released), it's on punishing them harshly.
The prosecutor did a poor job and there was video of him being chased and assaulted by the victims.
In 1873 when the Supreme Court ruled in Taylor v. Taintor that bounty hunters were a part of law enforcement. In the US a bounty hunter (or bail bondsman) is one who hunts down a fugutive who failed to appear for court after posting bond, and the bounty is generally for a portion of the amount of the bail bond. For this reason the "dead or alive" for wanted fugitives would have been scrapped as the trial was not yet concluded and therefore a penalty could not have been placed upon them.
Like you're five...okay, let's try it like this: You get accused by your siblings of taking cookies from the cookie jar without permission. Your babysitter tells you that if you'll admit it, she'll just take some of your allowance as punishment but promises you nothing worse will happen. You confess. Later, your dad gets home, hears what you did from the babysitter and grounds you for 3-10 years. Your mother, three years later, decides that this was unfair because the only reason to confessed was that you were promised that you'd only lose money and lets you leave the house again.  In this story:  You = Cosby.  Babysitter = A district attorney in a former rape case, who promised Cosby immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony in a civil case.  Dad = The court that threw Cosby in jail.  Mom = The Pennsylvania Supreme Court.   Stealing cookies = rape.  3-10 years = 3-10 years.
- Sanctions are (mostly) economic measures imposed to its own economy in order to force a country to stop doing X, if the enforcing county deems X being contrary to its national interests. Normally they include a stop to specific trades, economic transfers or industries. A classic example would be *"we are not selling nuclear weapon technology to North Korea, every company doing that will be punished"*. - Sanctions are not unusual. While they are often the last resort of countries short before a war, they are used by economic more influential countries on countries to stop human atrocities or of specific nations gaining economic power or technology which could destabilize an entire region.  - In many cases sanctions are not obviously successful, but in some cases it forces a country to stop aggressive actions or at least back down. Often enough however they are used as a propaganda instrument from the affected country in order to galvanize the population ... and for the population of enforcing country  - In many cases a country (lets call it A) would not interfere with trades between Countries B and C. The problem is: the world wide economy is connected internationally and many payment systems and trades are done via US bank and payment systems. With that the US has a certain pressure power to enforce sanctions even when the trade does not directly involve their own economy. Regarding Russia: Russia is currently threatening (more or less directly) to invade the Ukraine, and is involved with the Crimea Occupation and the destruction of MH17. With that both the EU and the US have imposed sanctions of various levels on Russia, as especially the EU would not like to have a full blown war next to their eastern border. It most certainly did not helped that Russia attempted and performed multiple assassinations with radioactive particles and nerve gas in European countries. SYL
All male US citizens and permanent residents   aged 18-25 are registered as potential general draftees in case of need to draft the general population into military service. You just got a notice of your registration; if the data they have on you is incorrect they can correct it.
>	How is killing an unarmed man who throws a plastic bag and chases you for pointing a gun at him not manslaughter? Because the law says it is. Generally, if you’re in reasonable and imminent fear of death or serious injury from another’s illegal action, you can defend yourself with deadly force (wording depends on state law). Just because someone else doesn’t have a gun doesn’t mean they can’t hurt or kill you. And there is absolutely no requirement that you have to fight someone first.
You’re guaranteed a fair trial and legal defense under the US constitution, and your legal representation is there to ensure that everything is fair and legal during your proceedings. Entering a guilty plea doesn’t negate that, there’s a long and storied history of corrupt police departments and prosecutors forging evidence, beating a guilty plea out of some rando, and executing illegal search warrants. You can’t just assume that the “good guys” are good guys.
Multiple reasons. What if, 5 years after they're convicted, new evidence proves their innocence?
This is much more common than you might think. There are many common drugs whose mechanism of action isn't fully understood. You probably have Tylenol in your medicine cabinet - we don't know how that works, either.
The standard of proof in a criminal trial is higher than a civil trial. In a criminal trial the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In a civil trial, the balance of probability is used to determine blame.
It’s possible they feel like they need to get rid of it fast, so taking a half hour to take it fully apart, then another half hour to go to some river in the country and throw it there doesn’t seem like it’s worth the risk of getting caught in that time. Also, it’s entirely possible most do actually do that, but you only see the dumb ones on the news.
Because they're unreliable. Anything from high emotions to faulty machinery can give you wildly inaccurate recordings. Then there's the fact that the data is 'interpreted' by someone *and* that they can, in fact, be beaten pretty consistently
They still have that option. Just because a country doesn't have an extradition treaty doesn't mean they *can't* return a foreign criminal to their nation of origin. So if you flee to Andorra, Andorra can, in fact, say "Nope, go back to the US." and send you back. What an extradition treaty does is *obligates* the country to send the person back whether they want to or not (barring defined exemptions). And there are many reasons why one country would not want itself beholden to another country and wants to reserve the right to make that decision itself.
Well, technically they could make a ruling however they like.  However, there are cases where judges have overturned guilty verdicts when they (the judge) thought the prosecution failed to prove their position beyond a reasonable doubt.  The same cannot be done if the judge believes that the prosecution was able to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt but the jury returned a not guilty verdict. I live in Australia and there have been cases here where judges have ordered a jury to return a Not Guilty verdict.
They can't. Fair use is part of Bern convention of copyright. It says that if you use somebody's piece of work for educational purposes (but it has to be connected to that piece) or satire, it is ok. So, if you are doing a lesson (even YT essay) on pop music you can use a part of her song. You can't use it for a lesson about something unrelated though. And satire part is basically how South Park gets away with Mickey Mouse having sex with a bat.
I'd suspect that anyone saying "it is legal to steal" is either arguing from a place of bad faith (ie purely to try and make a political point rather than discuss the facts) or poorly informed and echoing someone in the former group.   You're correct.  Anything greater than $950 is a felony, anything below $50 can be charged as a minor infractions and anything between is a misdemeanor.  Where these people may be confused is that *Walgreens doesn't have to enforce these laws*.  It is not, repeat **NOT**, Walgreen's place or right to enforce laws covering larceny.  That is what the police are for, that is literally their primary function - enforce the law.  Walgreen's cannot arrest a person for shoplifting.  Now there is a bit of gray area because they do have a right to defend their property, so if they caught someone they COULD detain the person until the Police arrive but that's the point.  The Police HAVE to get involved.  Thus it becomes a business decision.  Walgreens is a multi-billion dollar company.  Someone stealing $50 of random crap from one store is such a small number that they probably accidentally lose that money in spare change under the seats of the CEO's private jet.  It would not at all be unusual for Walgreens to say "if you see someone shoplifting note down their description and call the cops but otherwise do NOT engage with them" because they'd rather lose the goods than have an employee hurt or even killed trying to be a hero.   You know who else has this policy - Banks.  Any bank in the US you can walk in and say "this is a robbery" and there is a good chance they'll open up the cash drawer and let you walk out with it.  Of course a few minutes later the Police and/or FBI will come to kick your head in but that's not the Bank's problem.  They have insurance and would much prefer dealing with that than an employee or customer hurt or killed.
I do not have the details or the facts, but I am also aware of the fact that people can and will withhold evidence and the like that paint them in a bad light. The most damning facts against Heard have come out after the initial ruling was made, therefore the initial judgement was based on flawed and incomplete information.
A jurors duty is (more or less) to decide whether or not the defendant has broken the law. Jury nullification is when a juror deliberately ignores whether the law has been broken, and instead chooses to acquit because they disagree with the law in principle. IE if I don't support the war on drugs, I may refuse to vote guilty on a charge for drug possession, even if I believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was committed. It's use is pretty controversial; it's the job of Congress (and indirectly, the voters) to decide which laws are just and which are unjust, not twelve random jurors. In the past it's been used for some good, but also a lot of nasty stuff. But since jurors do not have to justify their votes, there is little that can be done to stop them unless they outright admit to it.
Stem cell research is neither banned nor particularly controversial. What is banned is research on stem cells that come from aborted fetuses.  That's not particularly controversial, at least not anymore, since fetal stem cells have very little practical use.  Its very difficult to get them to do anything other than turn into a fetus and using them in someone else causes that person's body to reject them in the same way that it would reject any other organ from an unrelated person. Stem cell research focuses on cells derived from a person's own fat/skin/bone marrow.  That research actually has promise and is well funded in the US.
If you reported the theft and the fraud your credit card company shouldn’t hold you liable. Maybe the rules are different where you live, but in America, all the credit card fraud I’ve experienced was immediately wiped off the books by the card company.
> what does the US have that makes immigrants more likely to move there than Canada despite the racial discrimination, shitty healthcare and higher cost of living So the cliche is "Land of Opportunity". The US has a weak safety net, but it also doesn't spread the wealth around as much. So if you're in a position in a skilled field where you think you can make bank, you want to do it in the US where you'll probably not only make more money but keep more of it.  Consider physicians. While a family medicine doc in Canada might be comparable to one in the US in terms of take-home pay, an orthopedic surgeon might make [twice what a Canadian one does](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-doctors-still-make-dramatically-less-than-u-s-counterparts-study). So if you had a choice of around 400k a year or 200k a year, where would you live?
They don't keep jurors deliberating forever. If they have made an honest effort to deliberate and are deadlocked, the judge can declare a mistrial. The defendant can then be retried with a new jury.
Lie detectors aren’t particularly reliable, and they’re not admissible in a court as evidence for that reason. And even if they were, it only works if you have a small list of suspects. Otherwise, you’d have to test everyone in the city.
In the US, it's when the defendant chooses a jury trial, rather than a bench trial where the judge makes all the decisions.  There may also be restrictions on what you are charged with, as a special "small claims court" or "traffic court" may always have a judge only.
What happened here? Everything removed
In my US state, the age of consent is 16. But I’m in my 40s and I know how stupid I was when I was 16. So those probably need to be revisited.  But the big problem with consent and teenagers is that the girl (not a young woman, but definitely a girl) is 16 or so while the man is typically in his late 20s or early 30s.  That’s gross, despite the convo regarding age of consent.
It's not really saying "it's morally acceptable to do so" so much as saying "it would be immoral to punish them". There are many factors that go into deciding the age of consent, with a big one being when we deem someone mature enough to make that decision. Here in the UK, that age is 16. So if we have two people under 16 that have sex with each other, the law is essentially saying neither person was mature enough to make an informed decision either way on doing it. What this means is it would be very unfair to simultaneously say "you didn't know what you were doing" *and* "we should punish you for doing it". Edit: I should specify that the larger the age gap between the two underage participants, the less likely it is the older member will not be punished. For example, of it was two 15 year olds, then "fair enough", but if it was a 15 year old and an 11 year old, it would most certainly be considered an offence and dealt with accordingly.
Your ISP most likely tracked your behavior to an already reported source of illegal movies. You were then flagged for having downloaded it. This is terrible way to police IP however. How can they prove it was you who downloaded the movie? How do they know you weren’t Infected  with malware that downloaded the movie? How do they know a visitor to your home didn’t download a movie. I’d call bullshit on this.
The public reaction was generally very positive. It came after an extremely shocking shooting at a school in Dunblane, and public sentiment was very much a "never again" situation. I remember a little push back in terms of shooting clubs, but it was seen as a minor roadblock to a law which had widespread support. That was my experience of it at the time, it may well have felt differently in different parts of the country.
Because killing isn’t the same as murder. For example, if someone breaks into your home, runs at you with a knife, and you kill him in self-defense—you didn’t commit murder, or any other crime. It was justified. War takes this idea and extends it to the national level. Soldiers kill other soldiers, but it’s all (theoretically) in defense of the home country. At that point, you get into a plethora of theories on what constitutes a “just war” vs an unjust war, and leaders can sometimes be held to account for the latter category.
The USA is a federation, which means that it has state governments that exercise some powers, and a central government that exercises other powers. Each state is represented by two senators in the US Senate, and a number of Representatives in the House of Representatives. Ted Cruz, as one of the two Senators for the state of Texas, is responsible for promoting Texas's needs in the federal government. In an emergency he should be advocating for federal intervention - federal funds, deployment of the military, things of that nature.
I can’t say for certain about chicken pox twice, but generally after you get chicken pox once, if you get infected again, you can get shingles.  Shingles usually only occur in the elderly and immuno-compromised.  It is generally extremely painful and itchy.
Social pressure. Write to your representative, encourage them to repeal it. Protest. Speak out. Political pressure. Vote for a candidate who promises to try and repeal it. Vote out candidates who refuse to repeal it. If it is thought to be an unconstitutional law, like the one in Texas is believed to be, you can break it and appeal the case till it is heard by the Supreme Court, who will rule on its constitutionality.
The options are usually life in prison, or death. Pleading guilty in return for dodging the death penalty at least keeps you alive. Going to death row means there's a non-negligable probability of premature death at the hands of the state.  Some people believe living is preferable to dying, even if means living in prison. Particularly if you believe you're innocent, there's some chance that...eventually...your conviction may be overturned. You can't overturn a completed death sentence.
Innocent until proven guilty means that a person is assumed not to have committed the crime they are accused of until it can be proven that have committed it. Guilty until proven innocent is the opposite: a person must prove that they did not do what they were accused of, but they are automatically assumed to be guilty. So, I accuse you, Clear_Adhesiveness60, of being a witch.    Would you rather that a court assumed you were innocent until I brought evidence that you were guilty, or assumed that you were guilty until you brought evidence that you were innocent?   The penalty for being a witch might well be being burnt alive. That is the reason we use the “innocent until proven guilty” method.  The cost of assuming guilt is far too high.
The US Marshals are the branch responsible for: 1) Protecting federal courthouses and judges  2) Transporting and protecting federal prisoners 3) When needed, transporting and protecting federal witnesses 4) Tracking down and finding federal prisoners that have skipped bail or escaped, or federal witnesses that have refused to comply with a lawful subpoena 5) Serving subpoenas and court orders
You’ll be hard pressed to find a meaningful ELI5 answer to any linguistics question, but dialekts will dialekt, accents will accent.
That’s not how it works.  If you find something illegal and report it it’s not an issue. If you find it and look through it for 30 minutes then you are probably liable to be questioned. If you find it and hold it in your possession the excuse of “oh I found it” isn’t going to hold up. I strongly advise you to turn anything like that in immediately.
Physically yes.   Legally it depends. I work in law enforcement, and there is a legal term "Exigent Circumstances" that lets us for very specific reasons bypass the 4th Amendment (protection from unreasonable search and seizure).   When we have a missing child, a Jane/John Doe (someone we can't identify or who cannot identify themselves), and several other situations that will change depending on local laws. So just because it can be done doesn't mean everyone can.   There's nothing stopping a fingerprint from unlocking a phone from an engineering standpoint.
Children don't have an expectation of a right to privacy. The idea is that parents should be able to take care of their children, and protect them from themselves if the child is going to do something dangerous. Well yes, this could be used in an abusive fashion, it's felt that children don't have very many rights until they are adults.
Sometimes, right after arrest, the police make the criminals strip, to collect their clothes for trace evidence.  Those white "suits" are the temporary clothes they give the criminals to wear.
Attorney here.  Normally when the parties to a contract are in a dispute, one of them can file a lawsuit in the courts to try to get the problem sorted out. Sometimes, the parties will agree to have someone smart and experienced but who is not a judge(an arbitrator) basically conduct an informal trial just like a judge, and the parties agree that they'll treat that decision just like it was done by a judge.  Agreeingto treat the arbitrator's decision just like a judge's decision is what makes the decision *binding.*  The parties can make the agreement to use an arbitrator at any time. Sometimes it might be after they start disputing and they both just figure it's faster and cheaper to use arbitration. In that situation, neither has to; if you'd rather use the courts, you can decline to arbitrate.   *Mandatory* arbitration is when you can ONLY resolve a dispute through arbitration. The agreement to skip the courts and only use arbitration almost always comes as part of signing the main contract.  So like when you enter a cell phone contract,  that contract will usually include a provision that says both sides agree that they'll only take their disputes to arbitration through so-and-so arbitration organization.  Many people see this kind of arbitration as favoring the company because of the company is always having so-and-so organization doing the arbitration,  that's a lot of money for the organization,  and some people think that the organization is going to return the favor and make rulings in the company's favor.   So why would anyone agree to mandatory binding arbitration?  It's because they essentially have no choice. You have the choice not to buy the product or enter the contract at all, of course... but if you do decide to enter that contract,  you're pretty much stuck with the contract terms. It's take it or leave it. In contracts where each side thinks the other is important enough,  they can negotiate and tweak certain parts. But in a deal between the average schlub and Blizzard, Blizzard isn't going to waste their time trying negotiating the contract. Take it or leave it, they say.   In various places, laws have been passed to say that for some types of contract,  you must have the right to change your mind about mandatory arbitration, but will put a time limit on that.  So for instance, in my last cell phone contract I had 30 days after signing the contract to tell the phone company I didn't want to do mandatory arbitration.  Getting rid of mandatory arbitration would mean that Activision/Blizzard might not be so confident about their chances of success in arbitration, in which case maybe they'd behave better toward their customers.
The American mindset on prison is based on Puritan values, which focuses primarily on punishment, not rehabilitation.  So, you get truly horrible horrible prisons for the last 200 years or so. Then, we recently got into the joy-joy mindset of running prisons for profit, which translates into even worse places that are with an eye toward doing everything as cheap as possible 'and' to keep the convicts in prison for as long as possible to maximize their profit. Bonus points: The US is #1 in the world for the highest number of citizens incarcerated.  **USA USA USA**
As far as I know no. Life sentence means as long as you are alive, you will be sentenced. Even if they get reanimated.
Legal Eagle had a good video on this the other day. *Not a lawyer so take with a grain of salt, I'm just paraphrasing here* Normally such unconstitutional laws are challenged right away. Activists do so by suing the government, judge, or whoever is enforcing the law. Because abortion laws all violate the Supreme Court precedent set by Roe vs Wade they are almost always immediately struck down so they basically become unenforceable and never go into effect. Despite this Conservative States keep trying various iterations of anti-abortion laws over and over again even though there's no real point, the constitutionality of abortion laws is pretty well settled. If these laws remain on the books eventually they reach the Supreme Court who then strike it down for good. In this case though SB8 is specifically tailored to get around this. In a rather scummy way at that. Because the law allows regular citizens to basically become bounty hunters to turn in people that have abortions, the government and courts don't technically enforce this law so you can't take the usual route to get this law over turned. So the law will go into effect until such a time that someone actually tries to cash in the bounty on an abortion at which point it will work its way up to the Supreme Court and will likely get struck down like all the rest. The catch is how many Abortions will be stopped in the meanwhile?
Imagine your computer was a vast library full of books, with the location of every book catalogued and stored to quickly find it later. This is basically how your computer stores information. Now imagine that sometimes a book is too big to fit on a shelf, and the shelf next to that shelf is also full. This isn't a problem because you have all the location of the books catalogued, so what you do is cut the book in half and catalogue part one on one shelf and part two on a shelf down the hall. This data is now fragmented. This works fine, but can obviously get annoying to have to run to two sections of the library to go get that info. So you under go the great library defragmentation. You basically take all the books down and re-arrange them so no book is broken up like that. This is data defragmentation.
In simple terms, RvW was a decision by the US Supreme Court that guaranteed women the right to have an abortion during their first trimester of pregnancy.  Some states are trying to overturn that right and make abortion illegal, or only legal very early in the pregnancy, or only legal in certain circumstances, etc.  The only way the states can do that, legally, is if the US Congress enacts new laws . . . or the Supreme Court overturns all or part of its own prior decision in RvW. Basically, the Supreme Court may soon allow states to enact law banning or limiting abortions.
Ahmaud Arbery's murderers were actually charged with five counts of murder. The first count is *malice murder,* and this was the actual act of killing Arbery. The other four counts, *felony murder,* stem from the four non-murder counts: two each of aggravated assault, one of false imprisonment, and one of criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. But, because someone died in the commission of those four felonies, the *felony murder rule* allows them to be charged with a count of felony murder on top of the felony, to represent the seriousness of the crime.
Fighting is a way for the sport to police itself and to remind players that there are consequences for stepping over the line during play in such a way that "the Code" is violated.
The goal is typically to drive away the "not sure" crowd in hopes of helping some other title or harming the media they're reviewing. For example, a few years ago when Venom came out in theaters there was also a movie with Lady Gaga released that same weekend. Hardcore fans of Venom were going to watch it anyways, but the Lady Gaga fans wanted to drive the fence sitters over to their movie. Hence review bombing
Because emergency services, police and others may be harmed trying to save you from yourself. If you die to one of your own traps it will be a hazard for the next guy trying to scrape your body off of the walls.
You don't know if they committed a crime. In theory they are supposed to presumed innocent until convicted by a jury
Getting a ticket means you literally get a ticket handed to you. Driving without headlights is technically an offense you can be cited for, but the cop would *really* have to be a dick to cite you for it when it's quite obviously your first traffic violation of any kind.
President, Governor, Mayor.  Those are all the same job, but on different scales. You are the head of the executive branch of government.  Your day is meetings and phone calls, including with department heads and members of the legislative and judicial branches. You do your best to shape the policy for your jurisdiction, to recruit new business, and to establish or maintain relationships with other governmental jurisdictions and their leaders.
Rare gloves covered in victim’s blood he is famous for wearing found at the scene of the crime where few people would go except for him and the victims. Him being seen coming and going. His well-known anger issues. I’m sure there was more evidence, but I don’t really pay much attention at the time. He got away with it because good lawyers, racist cops, and stupid juries are a bad mix.
"Inhabitable" can *also* actually mean "not capable of supporting life". This is the sense when the prefix is "in-", meaning "not". But "inhabit" is from the French "enhabiter" which is from the Latin "inhabitare" -- in this case, it is a fully self-contained word (in English at least) that just means "habitable".  Inflammable is actually similar to "inhabitare"  - it comes from the Latin "inflammare". So in this case, we're *not" using "in-" as a prefix to mean "not", we're just borrowing the word from a different language. And it just happens to have the same starting syllable so it looks like it should mean something else. With "inconclusive", it's *only* "in-", meaning "not".
Boy: Woof! You sure gotta climb a lot of steps to get to this Capitol Building here in Washington. But I wonder who that sad little scrap of paper is? I’m just a bill. Yes, I’m only a bill. And I’m sitting here on Capitol Hill. Well, it’s a long, long journey To the capital city. It’s a long, long wait While I’m sitting in committee, But I know I’ll be a law someday At least I hope and pray that I will, But today I am still just a bill. Boy: Gee, Bill, you certainly have a lot of patience and courage. Bill: Well I got this far. When I started, I wasn’t even a bill, I was just an idea. Some folks back home decided they wanted a law passed, so they called their local Congressman and he said, “You’re right, there oughta be a law.” Then he sat down and wrote me out and introduced me to Congress. And I became a bill, and I’ll remain a bill until they decide to make me a law. I’m just a bill Yes I’m only a bill, And I got as far as Capitol Hill. Well, now I’m stuck in committee And I’ll sit here and wait While a few key Congressmen discuss and debate Whether they should let me be a law. How I hope and pray that they will, But today I am still just a bill. Boy: Listen to those congressmen arguing! Is all that discussion and debate about you? Bill: Yeah, I’m one of the lucky ones. Most bills never even get this far. I hope they decide to report on me favourably, otherwise I may die. Boy: Die? Bill: Yeah, die in committee. Oooh, but it looks like I’m gonna live! Now I go to the House of Representatives, and they vote on me. Boy: If they vote yes, what happens? Bill: Then I go to the Senate and the whole thing starts all over again. Boy: Oh no! Bill: Oh yes! I’m just a bill Yes, I’m only a bill And if they vote for me on Capitol Hill Well, then I’m off to the White House Where I’ll wait in a line With a lot of other bills For the president to sign And if he signs me, then I’ll be a law. How I hope and pray that he will, But today I am still just a bill. Boy: You mean even if the whole Congress says you should be a law, the president can still say no? Bill: Yes, that’s called a veto. If the President vetoes me, I have to go back to Congress and they vote on me again, and by that time you’re so old… Boy: By that time it’s very unlikely that you’ll become a law. It’s not easy to become a law, is it? Bill: No! But how I hope and I pray that I will, But today I am still just a bill. Congressman: He signed you, Bill! Now you’re a law! Bill: Oh yes!!!
Well like all legal questions the specifics vary.  Generally, second degree murder is a lesser and included charge to first degree murder. So is manslaughter. What that means is that the state can charge the accused with first degree murder, and the jury can convict on a lesser and included charge if it turns out that the state doesn't prove all the elements of first degree murder.
If you’re in favor of tolerance, should you tolerate intolerance? If you say you want to tolerate “all” views, how do you deal with intolerant views? Really, there’s no *real* paradox, because pro-tolerance people are *really* anti-intolerance people and the whole argument is really just semantic bullshit.
It’s not just for LEOs. It’s for any government official performing their governmental duties. It comes in to play with law enforcement a lot, though, as damages do occur in pursuit of criminals and such; for example the case in Denver a few years back. Cops chased an armed shoplifting suspect and he holed himself up in a random house who’s owners were not home. Police destroyed the hell out of this person’s home in pursuit of a shoplifting suspect and were ruled to be not liable for the damages due to them occurring during a pursuit of a dangerous individual. When stuff gets destroyed by cops in their line of duty, the owners are usually still gonna be pretty mad about it. Being told to kick rocks and that the city/department responsible for the damage won’t be reimbursing you can be quite infuriating
I’m no lawyer, but I read it as them asking if you ever went back and enrolled at the school a second time, after your experience that you’re trying to have the loans forgiven for. Like, if you enrolled and studied there for a year but didn’t finish the degree and you’re trying to have the loans forgiven for that, they want to know if you went back a year later to finish the degree at the same school?  Attempted to edit for clarity
Surely that's just something to look up - which part warrants explaining?      >death caused by a person accidentally while performing a legal act without negligence or intent to harm.      I.e. you go for a swim and, overestimating your own abilities, drown. You go spelunking and get lost, never to return to the surface. You accidentally overdose on prescription medication and never wake up again.
In the United States Senate, a Senator can talk as long as they want unless sixty Senators vote to make them stop. Talking for a long time delays voting on bills. Voting to end a debate is called cloture.  It used to be that Senators had to actually keep taking to prevent a vote, which limited how much they could delay anything, but in the 70s, they changed to a two track system where just threatening to filibuster a bill means that the Senate won't try to hold a vote on it.  Effectively, any one Senator can prevent a bill from passing unless sixty Senators want it to pass.
There are a lot of issues that contribute to this, some if it's policy related, some of it isn't. First, DAs are an elected position and the seat can be bought for practically nothing. Many DA seats have been taken over by activists who will drop criminal charges depending on who it is. Because of this, people feel like they have a chance to get away with it. Then there's the issue in some cities in California having a rule where any petty theft under $995 will not be pursued. This has lead to people shoplifting on mass because they know they can get away with it. To add, being stuck in your house without a job can really tax on people. This is why a lot of people were going out and marching because despite covid, the marches themselves were not really policed in spite of people being really close to one another. This promoted people to be activists even when they didn't believe or really understand what was going on. Now that the activism has slowed down due to the election being over, people are still used to wondering the streets and given that they've been told they live in a racist system and that capitalism is evil, it's not a surprise that many people would vandalize places in these cities. Although the weather isn't as much of a factor, it is getting nicer out so people are going out more. A lot of crime is spontaneous, you see a house, no one is watching, you wrap your head in a shirt and break in to steal some shit. Not to mention that covid killed a lot of jobs and now that people have been not working for several months, people have decided that they don't want to work, which has caused a labor shortage. This leads to people being overworked because the jobs they do still demand work from them only now there's less help, and that causes stress, frustration, and that might be channeled from the previous point on being an activist. It can also just result in fights breaking out, people are on edge and there's a lot of division in the country right now. And no, it's not just the summer, places like NYC have a jump in crime %22 compared to this time last year. Although there are environmental factors like covid and the fact that it's not winter, it's mainly just bad policy.
ATM robberies are definitely a thing. Doing it on a larger scale with a huge wire transfer is more difficult.  You’d need to be sophisticated enough to know who has enough money to bother kidnapping, and have a secure and anonymous method to transfer the funds established in advance. Then you’d have to actually pull it off, and keep the person against their will long enough for the funds to clear and for you to make the additional moves required to launder the money before they contact the police. It’s a complicated and highly organized crime beyond the scope of your typical junkie.
If police use the "Blue Flu" excuse, then there is less police presence on the streets.  Less traffic stops and tickets.  Less arrests.  Less investigation of major crimes.  It takes longer for police to arrive at an incident, like a traffic accident. If air-traffic controllers tried the same thing, plane would be slamming into each other, into buildings, into the ground, etc. Big difference.
If you only trust the armorer or prop master, you have a single point of failure, if they screw up and you don't take responsibility for safety, someone gets shot. Prop master's are not perfect, I briefly worked ot set design for a theater and while I was there someone got cut on a knife because the prop master have them a sharp one instead of a dull prop knife. When you are doing something thousands of times, you will make a mistake. What Baldwin should have done was to check the gun when he received it. Actors have a responsibility for their props, especially when they are weapons. Obviously he had to aim it for the scene, but in general you should never aim a gun, unloaded or not at anyone. Even if you are 99.99% sure it's safe, that's way to risky to do. For comparison, skydiving is a viewed as risky, but it is 99.9999% safe. The question is that: do you trust the armorer enough to blindly put your or someone elses life at stake by not doing a 5 second check of your gun?
So here is an argument that people have been having.    When does life start? Does it start when the baby takes its first breath, like it says in the Bible?  Does it start when the brain finally starts sending signals other than the standard functions?  Is it when the heart just starts beating?  Is it when the shape of a human starts forming?  How about when a sperm and egg meet.  What about the act of sex. Can that be life?  What about the decision to have a child. Can this be where life starts  So after you find out what time life starts, are you willing to kill it? It is a child, a new human being that has not done any harm or committed any sin. Now here are your 'What if'  questions.    What if carrying the child will cause the mother to die. What if it was not the mothers choice What if the child will be deformed and live a [painful life.](https://youtu.be/fqnoGDQ2i2k) What if being pregnant will hurt the [mother's image](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/11/victorias-secret-ed-razek-comments/amp) What if it is a child of rape What if it is a child that is wanted, [but could not be cared for](http://adopt.org/what-foster-care#:~:text=What%20the%20foster%20care%20system,of%20reasons%2C%20care%20for%20them.) What if the mother was [5 years old](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lina_Medina) What if everyone is scared to have this child, but everything would turn out all right for everyone, and they would be happy and healthy their entire lives.
Let's start with the simplest attack, and work up to the more complex. Alice owns a bank.  Bob somehow gains access ( dumpster diving for passwords on paper, or threatening Alice employee, etc ).  Bob then can steal information,  This is known as an ACCESS ATTACK.  The downside ( from Bob's point of view  ) is that Bob has information, but he has to engage in some second activity to monetize it. Suppose Bob wants to do a bit more, particularly if he wants to damage Alice's bank.  He goes to his stockbroker, buys puts ( contracts that guarantee the sale of a stock at a certain price ) then changes Alices web page.  Bob has graduated from reading data to writing data.  This is known as a MODIFICATION ATTACK. When the world reads that Alice's web page that now openly supports Stormfront, her stock tanks, and Bob buys the stock at a low price, invokes the contract with his broker, and sells at a high price.  This is riskier than a simple access attack because there are now clear traces showing how Bob profited.  There is also the downside that Alice will be very aware that she has been attacked, and this will lead her to harden her defenses, and to call the cops. So Bob may add a new wrinkle.  He not only modifies information in Alice's database, but he then defrauds Alice directly, using her corrupted data against her.   **It is this direct, post-modification contact that make Bob's actions a REPUDIATION ATTACK**. Bob, in preparation for the attack, took out a loan with Alice's bank.  When he does his modification attack, he changes Alice's records to show that he paid off the loan.  When Alice's bank requests the regular monthly payment from Bob, Bob calls up Alice's customer service, and informs them that they made a mistake.  They check their records, and decide that the loan is indeed paid off. So Bob walks away with free money.    The upside of the repudiation attack is that if Bob has done it skillfully, Alice may never know.  Bob may be able to do it multiple times. The downside - from Bob's point of view - of a repudiation attack is that he has to give up some contact information to Alice.  If Alice's security people are on their toes, they might be able to trap Bob. Suppose that Charlie, Alice's data security officer, is indeed on his toes.  Prior to Bob's attack, Charlie wrote a maintenance program that runs in the background, checking all alleged payments.   Any time a payment is recorded as having been made, Charlie's program attempts to match the payment with ACH records from whichever bank was the other party in the transfer. Any time that the maintenance program detects a problem, it sends a text message to Charlie.  When Bob commits his modification attack, Charlie knows about it within minutes. Charlie contacts Dave, the agent who works in the financial crimes division of the local FBI office.  Charlie has Bob's telephone number from the call to customer service, and Bob's social security number and home address from the loan application.  Dave then gets a warrant to search Bob's premises. Dave then goes...well, we are getting a bit off topic now.  We will leave Dave and Bob to their cat and mouse games.  The important point here is that a repudiation attack involves post-attack involvement with the victim, and therefore can be very risky.
It depends on the state. Some states don’t have degrees. Texas for instance just has regular and capital murder. But typically it depends on if it was premeditated, the circumstances surrounding the murder, like were you also committing another felony at the time, and who was killed, if it was a kid or a cop or multiple people that kicks it up a degree.
Grades are not out of someone's control. Post secondary education is for adults. If they need help they need to seek it out, it is not the responsibility of the professor for the students to pass. The university will dismiss these students because the low grades are an indication of their work ethic and reflect poorly on the university.
Essentially, the difference is in the actual meat of the argument. Let me give an example. If I said "I have COVID because my doctor said I do," that would be an appeal to authority. The argument for why I have COVID in this case is that somebody with authority (the doctor) said it. I am appealing to my opponent by using the authority of someone as my argument. However, if I said "I have COVID because my doctor gave me a test that detected the virus in my body," that's not an appeal to authority because my argument hinges on my positive COVID test as evidence, not on the credentials of the doctor.
Weapon laws have a suspicious amount of correlation to movies. When the 80s ninja movies craze happened, ninja weapons started getting banned left and right. All over the western world. Nunchucks, throwing stars, and so on. When mob movies were big, brass knuckles and sops and switchblades were banned. I'm surprised it's taken this long for people to go after firearm suppressors. Now, all of those are novelty items. For the most part, they're less practical to own and use than guns. A switchblade isn't of major utility, and no large group really cares about them. Guns, however, are significant in many sports and recreational activities, and also significant to culture. This has preserved them at least for now.
The rationale for a jury trial is that the state itself isn't trustworthy enough to guarantee a fair trial. A jury of one's peers is necessary to ensure a just outcome. By extension, if the jury was only permitted to include people who've enjoyed the kind of life that allowed them to go to law school and become well versed in law, the demographic of the typical juror would be very different from the demographics of most people on trial.
Criminal allegations means they may have done it. If they are found guilty, they are removed from office.
they get both.  There are two court systems working in parellel, criminal court and civil court. They have different standards. In criminal court, the government brings a prosecution on behalf of a complaining witness. the punishments can be financial, but they can also be jail time or probation. Only the state has the legal authority to deprive you of your liberty. in civil court, it's always financial since a private citizen can not legally detain another private citizen.  In criminal court, the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt, in civil court it's more likely than not or criminal court is 100%, civil court is 51%. The most famous example of this is oj simpson, he won in criminal court and avoided jail time, but he lost in civil court and had to pay the families.
This is for the US: Trials by jury are guaranteed if the imprisonment sentence can be longer than six months, or a certain amount of fine can be levied or things like suspension of driving privileges for longer than X days. If it falls underneath these thresholds it is left to the state whether a jury trial is needed or not; It can be requested by the defendant but may be denied. For things that are fine-only like with traffic tickets you'll very likely get a bench trial (judge), as well as in some civil cases. This is to balance between the right to jury trial, and the right to a speedy trial. If every speeding ticket needed to get run through 12 people with unanimous vote to convict before they get fined, the system would bog down Even more than it already is. There also is a desire to minimise costs, and jurors are paid for their time and travel, so if you hold jury trial days on say just Monday Wednesday Friday each week and just slog through all the petty stuff on the other days you keep the system moving and reduce jury costs by 40%.
The people who make and interpret laws in the United States believe that a Judge saying "you aren't allowed to disrupt the court by doing or saying anything that isn't appropriate" doesn't count as a violation of the First Amendment.
Executing a Death Sentence comes with a lot of built in safety Rails to enable for appeals/retrials  and reevaluations of cases.this is because unlike with other sentences, a Death Sentence is irreversible once done(duh). the State wants to be absolutely sure that if they have to go thru with this they are executing the right person. It's not uncommon that a rushed execution leads to at a later point the discovery of new evidence that would have exonerated the now Dead person. so it's either do it with perfect accuracy, or you should probably not execute people at all.
Essentially our constitution states that any power not specifically granted to the federal government is reserved for the individual states  So sometimes we get conflicting laws like marijuana is illegal on the federal level but many states have legalized its use or even more have at least decriminalized it  It can get confusing and is a legal grey area until our judicial system clarifies who and what will be the prevailing law Also states or federal law may be more or less restrictive than the other
They're usually not, it's usually these exceptions you hear about precisely because they are exceptions. With something like a pool, you are required to take basic precautions, like locking the fence or covering it because it is an enticement, called an 'attractive nuisance and danger to children, but if you've done fairly normal things, you're not responsible. For your home itself, its mostly down to whether or not the thing that hurt a trespasser would have also hurt a normal visitor. You're generally not liable for a trespasser hurting themselves, but if its from something negligent that would have hurt anyone, you might be. Like if the front steps of your house collapse or a statue falls off the roof on their head... it did happen to a trespasser, but it could have just as easily been the mailman, so you may be liable because you've got some responsibility. The story people like to tell about a thief falling through the roof then suing is pretty unlikely, because that's not a normal responsibility you'd have.    That's what it comes down to, if your 3 y/o niece was visiting and snuck into the pool and died, you're responsible. Same applies to the uninvited 3 y/o next door.    But if the 3 y/o's mom has to open the gate to let the 3 y/o in, it doesn't apply.
Usually it means that you have a number to call at a certain time every evening.  It should be on your jury summons.  You call that number, and it will either tell you the range of juror numbers (which will also be on your summons) that have to appear.  Or, some systems you punch in your number and it will tell you if you need to appear.
The idea is that if a store closes at 11 pm, all business should be concluded by 11 pm.  If you walk in at 10:30 you can probably do that, but if you walk in at 10:59 you probably can't. Employees are paid to close the store down, but they still want to go home.  They are tired after a full shift and they still have work to do to get the store closed and ready for the next day.  There are some things that you _can't_ do until the doors are locked, so if a customer is there after closing, they are going to have to stay later than they want to take care of that customer and then finish closing duties. It is rude to expect employees to stay later than they have to because you couldn't be bothered to show up and conclude your business during opening hours.
Because it's brutal, cruel, unethical, immoral, inhuman and utterly ineffective as a deterrent.
It depends on the country you are in, but most places are very, very concerned about not giving the military law enforcement powers. In the US the Posse Comitatus Act explicitly forbids the US military from doing any sort of law enforcement in peace times. There are some edge cases like military police policing people in the military and to some very limited degree civilians on military installations , but not much else. There is also the coast guard which is explicitly not military in peace time and does law enforcement, but becomes military in war times.  Other countries have less strict difference between military and law enforcement. Gendarmeries exist in many countries under different names such as "Carabinieri" (Italy) or "Marechaussee" (Netherlands) and they are a branch of the miliary whose purpose is law enforcement. The reason why many countries don't want to mix up their regular military and their police is that it can lead to very bad things as far as the rights of citizens are concerned it is however a common feature of dictatorships especially military dictatorships.
Objection-Overruled: Your objection is invalid. This is bad for Objector. Objection-Sustained: Your objection is valid. This is good for Objector.
Well, there isn't a law against invading other countries so the President launching one can't be giving an "illegal order." If Congress believes such an action is unjustified, they have tools at their disposal to deal with a President taking them. If they do not, then that is tacit justification of said action.
There's a phenomenon called "scary black gun syndrome" where the caliber and other factors are less important than how the gun looks when it comes to regulation. It's basically the same thing you get when people attempt to regulate anything they don't understand at all.
Here is the best description I have seen on this topic: Gayle Williams writes: Great summary posted about the Rittenhouse trial.. “I have watched the whole Rittenhouse case.  The Jury is in deliberation now.  I didn't know that Kyle put out a dumpster fire that was being rolled down to a gas station to blow up, with people all around. I didn't know that the Police were told to stand down as businesses were destroyed.  I didn't know that Kyles Dad, Grandma and Friends all lived in Kenosha, 20 minutes from where he resided with his Mom part time in Illinois.  I didn't know that Joseph Rosenbaum knocked him down twice and then attempted to kick him with lethal force to the head.  I didn't know that Huber had hit him in the head 2x with a skateboard.  I didn't know Gaige Grosskreutz, a felon in possession of firearm, aimed his gun at Kyle first, as he admitted on the stand.  I also didn't know that in the State of Wisconsin, it is legal for Kyle to have a gun, even at 17 (which was why the gun charge was dismissed).  I didn't know that Kyle did not cross state lines with a gun he wasn't supposed to have. The rightful gun owner did, as he was legally permitted to do.  I also didn't realize that Rosenbaum was a 5 time convicted child rapist and that Huber was a 2 time convicted woman beater. I didn't know that Grosskreutz was a convicted Burglar with an assault on his record also.  IF THE MEDIA DID THEIR JOB... we would ALL have known this! Stop believing the media lies
> How can people just "squat" long enough that they are allowed to be there? If I stopped paying rent, I can't just stay and live there forever for free? Philosophically, it comes from the idea that it's better for the community to have all property in the hands of people who will care for it and improve it.  Imagine that Owner owns a plot of land and just ignores it, but Squatter comes in and builds a house there and Owner doesn't do anything about it.  Squatter has actually provided value to the community and is viewed by the law as deserving the land more than Owner does.  Now, the law still gives Owner a chance to stop it early in the process, but the law also has a principle, called laches, that if you unnecessarily delay in getting the court involved, you forfeit your right to complain. > Hypothetically, if I trekked onto someone's private acreage and was able to go undetected for a set amount of time, that land could just become mine after long enough? Doesn't make sense! No, because one of the requirements for adverse possession under the common law is "notorious and open" possession.  Squatter has to be blatant to anyone near the property that Squatter is in the process of claiming the property for himself.
Many charges have mandatory or even suggested minimum sentences that can be carried out concurrently (at the same time as one another) or consecutively (one after the other).   People are eligible for parole after 1/3 of their sentence in many cases and judges don’t always have the authority to mandate a sentence be carried out without possibility of parole so this can be an end around to ensure someone never gets out
First, it’s important to understand there are two sets of courts - State and Federal. Most States have three “levels” of courts: 1 District Court, 2 Court of Appeals, and 3 Supreme Court. (There is also a magistrate court under the district court, think traffic tickets, but that’s getting pretty complex.) There are also three “levels” of Courts on the Federal Level also. 1 District, 2 Appeals Court, 3 US Supreme Court.  The US is split into 13 different regions, and each region has a Court of Appeals. So, if you had a Federal Case, first you would take it to the Federal District Court. Then, if you didn’t like the outcome, you would appeal it to the Appeals court in your region. Finally, you would take it to the US Supreme Court after the court of appeals. TL/DR: There are three levels of Courts, it is the middle one.
Well, if no one can figure out that it’s the defendant doing it, then they people would probably just keep getting repacked by the judicial system, the trial might need to be restarted once or twice. But in reality, people would notice the pattern, and chances are people involved in the trial would start to be placed under increased security/identity protection.
They are strict, deadly abusive and based on religion. One can be easily stoned to death for some medieval-morale reasons. These laws keep everyone in fear, which leads to many people start enforcing them, trying to not be found guilty for lack of support
US Federal courts do not allow cameras in their court rooms. Other US courts have various policies, some allow cameras, and some do not. When cameras are not allowed, the media uses a sketch artist, because people like pictures with their news.
ASD tends to cause difficulties with reading people and finding the socially appropriate expressions, but there’s no lack of empathy. Sociopathy can include a knack for social interaction, but there’s no empathy; someone on the autistic spectrum might be awkward or not, but they’ll likely be loyal to their own detriment, a sociopath sees you as a tool of convenience to be discarded when no longer needed. There’s no connection between the two, that I know of.
You are not allowed to pass to your teammate who is closer to the opponent's goal than any defender (not including their goalie).
>How is that allowed to happen?      It's not.      >So I see videos about criminals who have loads of evidence stacked against them but after their interrogation their lawyers devise a story to try and get them out of it, even when it’s obviously fake.      Telling a story is not evidence. If you have "evidence stacked against you" then you or your lawyer better have something more substantial than a story as a defense strategy.         Also keep in mind that one only becomes a criminal *after* a guilty verdict. Guilt is determined by the court, not before.
You are innocent until proven guilty. So people who are arrested and put in jail pending trial are technically innocent people held captive against their will. But it might be hard to just let arrested people free until their trial. But at least jail can only do the least amount of effort required to keep them until trial. And in some cases the least invacive way to make sure people show up to their trial is not to put them in jail but instead put their possesions in jail. This is what bail is. So instead of spending maybe months in jail awaiting trial because the judge things they will flee if released the judge say that they would be comfortable enough if they left 1000 euros to be returned when they show up to trial. They will probably not want to flee from the trial leaving that much money behind.
That’s actually the point! In a lot of western judicial systems, a prisoner has a chance of release at approximately half way through their sentence. Some judicial systems have the concept of a “whole life tariff,” where the prisoner will serve the remainder of their life without a chance of release. In judicial systems where that doesn’t exist, ridiculously long sentences are used. Sentencing someone to 120 years, meaning they have the chance of release after 60, means they are likely to serve out the remainder of their life before that chance comes up. Alternatively, if that opportunity isn’t to be afforded, a sentence such as 120 years simply offers insurance in the event that the prisoner happens to live a long life.
there are huge differences. "jailbreak" at its core just means you have broken out of the jail iOS puts each app in, allowing it to access more of the system. most jailbreaks do leverage this to gain root access which means you can theoretically do anything, but you have to be very careful with it because modifying the wrong file can render the phone inoperable (like deleting system32 from windows, but worse) even with jailbreak iphones typically remain locked into iOS. the whole boot process is controlled so it can only boot into iOS, and then only into versions of iOS that apple signed for you to install. if you mess up your jailbroken iOS 13 or 14 and want to reinstall it (like you would reinstall windows after deleting system32), apple will instead force you to update to iOS 15 and you'll be stuck there so the things you can do with jailbreak are rather limited. it's been years since anyone has achieved an untethered jailbreak, meaning it boots directly into a jailbroken state. you alwasy boot into stock iOS, open unc0ver, and let it run an exploit to re-jailbreak. nobody has truly eliminated the sideloading restriction either. with a regular account you can only sideload a handful of apps, and you have to re-sign them every 7 days or they stop working so the idea that a jailbroken phone is a bigger security risk than a PC, which has ways to gain full access to everything built in, is silly. the truth is a mix of security theater, misinformed managers, and user-hostility. a lot of companies would love to lock down your desktop experience the same way the do your mobile experience, but they know this would spark outrage. so they only do it on mobile, where people are more used to not having a choice because the idea of phones being general-purpose computers rather than appliances is relatively new. to protect their power over you they spread scary stories about security and malware, which a lot of well-intentioned people sadly believe. so even apps that aren't trying to steal your data or fill your phone with ads end up with restrictions that are allegedly there to protect you
They aren't exactly terms with definitions set in stone, but in general, Practical Shooting is a type of competitive shooting that involves moving and shooting, and how quickly you hit targets is the key.  Tactical Shooting is more like real combat training, and it works a bit differently.  For example, in Practical Shooting, you generally try to hit a target with a single bullet and then move to the next target.  In Tactical Shooting, you train to fire multiple rounds at each target.  In Practical Shooting, taking cover is far less important than with Tactical Shooting.  In Practical Shooting, all that matters is hitting targets, so you use your dominant hand; in Tactical Shooting, you actually practice firing with your off hand, in case you are injured and that's your only option. In sum, Practical Shooting is more like sport, while Tactical Shooting is training a person to really use a firearm in combat.
what type of blacklists? It's a word that means kind of the same thing in a lot of contexts.
We say "The F B I, I R S" etc... But we pronounce NASA "Nasa" and NOAA is usually pronounced "Noah", as if they are proper nouns. Additionally, FBI and IRS are authoritative while NASA and NOAA are research. The different type of organization and the ease of pronouncing it like a word combine to make us more "familiar" with NASA and the like. Art museums don't follow a rule, for example: The MET (NY's Metropolitan Museum of Art) MoMA (The Museum of Modern Art) So I imagine it's just how the press uses it which determines how we say those acronyms.
>What's to stop the kid from just asking for more? The dad saying no. How taxes are distributed is regulated in contracts/laws, not by "hey we need a little more this month"
Going to get removed, but here is your answer. They didn't ban them.  They just made the restrictions so tight that they are effectively banned.  The SCOTUS allowed _reasonable_ restrictions on abortions in _Casey_, and many states have been pushing the limit on what is 'reasonable.' The Texas legislature passed the most restrictive bill in recent memory.  Abortions after 6 weeks are basically forbidden, which means that almost all women will be too far along for an abortion by the time they realize they are pregnant.   Historically, the SCOTUS has struck down laws like this that were overly restrictive, but in this case (in a 5-4 decision) the decided reject an emergency injunction - meaning the law is in effect until the larger case is heard.  So, for now, abortions are banned in Texas in every way that matters.
Commonly known doesn't mean the fbi has jurisdiction.  Fbi by itself can only shut down websites hosted in the united States.   If a website is hosted outside of the US, then fbi need co-operation from other nations and that needs to be coordinated and deals in foreign relations and politics.
Soliciting a minor for sex is a crime, even if you don't actually end up having sex with said minor (which is a different crime). The fact that the 'minors' are not actually children isn't material - the men in question _thought_ they were children, so it is still a crime.  Same as when a person solicits an undercover officer for sex - the fact that the officer isn't actually a prostitute and was never going to have sex for money doesn't change the fact that the John committed a crime just by asking.
The federal government has become involved in trying to stop the problem.  Congress passed the TRACED Act, and now the FCC is taking action against robocallers/spoofers and requiring phone companies to take action to stop the calls.  Here's  their site if you're  interested in reading about what's  going on.  https://www.fcc.gov/spoofed-robocalls
Trials are not automatically redone if the jury is hung.  The Prosecutor has the **option** to try the case again, but they only do this when they think they do things differently to get a different result.  Sometimes prosecutors do bad things, retrying cases to cover up that they may have done a bad thing before in charging a person without adequate evidence.
Bormann was missing at the time of the trial and only later declared officially dead. Hitlers death had been confirmed though. It makes sense to put a person on trial when you don't know if they are dead or alive, but less to put a dead person on trial.
"The US government is asking the court to declare the abortion law “invalid, null, and void,” and bar Texas from enforcing it in any way." So they want the court to strike down the law
In the US, they are federal law enforcement.  They are not on most flights.  They use intelligence to prioritize which flights to put agents on.  The airlines aren't in charge of any of this, the rules are set by their regulator, the FAA.  They can use lethal force.  The pilot is in charge of the plane and the flight, the air marshals aren't involved with that.
Doctors are not required to accept all patients, any more than lawyers are required to accept any criminal that calls them up. One thing professionals factor into business decisions is "how much will it cost, and what will I get paid?".  Medicare pays less and costs much more in terms of paperwork, presuming that actually providing the medical care costs the same.
Satan doesn't punish sinners in hell in the Christian Bible. He pretty much doesn't exist in the Bible as written. Most of what we associate with Satan, the idea that hell is a fiery place that sinners are tortured in by demons, came from the later book Dante's Inferno and a bunch of miscellaneous folklore. You are correct that much of the stories we tell about the devil don't really seem to make sense in the context of God as portrayed in the Bible.
False advertising needs to be demonstrably false, which is harder said than done. Products will make claims that are so vague that they can't be proven to be false. If a product says that it *can* cure baldness, but only cures 2% of users, it still lives up to its claim. It's misleading, but not false. To further this, many adds will contain small print disclaimers that elaborate on their claims. One good example is the advertisement for mobile games. You will often see the small print *not actual gameplay.* With this disclaimer, they can show something completely unlike the game in the ad. That being said, there is probably a lot of illegal advertising, but no one has taken the time to take these companies to court. The law does not work automatically, it requires human intervention.
In soccer, as well as many other sports, the offside rule is meant to keep play flowing and force players to use the field. Without the offside rule, all the offensive players would flood the box at all times, and thus the defense would have to crowd the box. The game would be a wild scramble from box to box. With the offside, the attacking team has to use skill to get the box. Also, it encourages the defense to be a bit more aggressive.
I mean, committing crimes in countries without the death penalty usually means life in prison, so that's not much better for most folks. But most crimes aren't done by people thinking about the long-term consequences of their actions or who take "what happens if I get caught?" into consideration. Going to another country to be a thief doesn't seem very likely at all.
The person serving the subpoena isn't just some rando, they are people legally authorized to serve process. If the person lies and says that they were not served then the person who served them testifies they *were* served. Perjury is a crime so that probably won't go over very well...
They do it all the time.  Sometimes they pay for the patents, and sometimes they just make cheap knock-offs.  There are plenty of AK-47s made in the USA.
Georgia charges people a bit differently than most other states.  In Georgia, each felony murder charge requires a separate, underlying felony conviction.  So for each underlying felony the jury is asked two questions: 1 - Did this person commit the underlying felony? 2 - If yes, did someone unlawfully die as a result? In the Arbery case, there were multiple underlying felonies, so each underlying felony also generated an additional felony murder charge.   Although each felony murder is listed as a separate charge, its not really correct to say that they're being convicted of multiple murders.  Each felony murder in this case is acting more as an enhancement to the underlying felony than it is its own, stand alone crime.
The legal system is flawed and as a matter of fact does sometimes convict innocent people who are later found to be innocent, sometimes after they've been executed. One might say "yeah but what about when we're REALLY sure" - well we shouldn't be executing ANYONE unless we're REALLY sure, right?
Because out-of-staters are more likely to pay the fine than return to contest a citation in court.  Easy money.
Because it's a national park, crimes committed on it cannot be tried in state courts, they have to be tried in federal courts. Under the constitution, the jury for these trials need to consist of individuals from both the court district and state the crime was committed in. That small area of the park that extends outside the borders of Wyoming are still part of a Wyoming court district, but part of the state of Montana or Idaho. Therefore, the jury would need to come from that specific small piece of land on which nobody lives, and therefore a jury would not be able to be found and the trial could not occur. In practice, there would probably be a quick decision by the Supreme Court expanding the area that the jury could be assembled from and the case would proceed normally.
I was told once that there are three reasons that someone murders, or the 3 Ps: - Passion:  Something happens that overwhelms them with rage/fear and they act out without thinking - Profit:  They stand to gain something with the other person dead. - Pathology:  They have an illness or compulsion that drives them to kill.
I don’t understand your question. Why is war allowed?  What would you do to prevent it- attack them?   The country getting attacked doesn’t really allow it. They have to either surrender or fight back.
that's just how it is in many US cities. big cities have a lot of poverty and thus a lot of crime. police can't be everywhere at once, unless a violent crime is being committed they aren't going to rush over there guns blazing.
It is just outrage.  Like crt, ask them about it and they can’t explain it at all.  They just know they are suppose to be angry.   Fauci biggest error was being a scientist.  He modified his guidance as new data and research came in.  Can’t use science as a basis for guidance when one side is very anti-science.
I guess most gun violence is emotional and reactionary, it's the difference between pulling a gun from a concealed place and shooting, and driving home, grabbing a rifle, finding a suitable location to shoot from etc. There is violence with rifles but it tends to be more planned out and so less frequent. You'll also need more skill to land a sniper shot than if you shot at someone point blank
Most everything we think of as "war crimes" could be considered more of international gentleman's agreements. They're things we don't want done to our guys, so we agree to not do them to other nations' guys.
Well, in the modern legal system, they’re now associating sex offense as mental illness. So, from a lawyers point of view, you can get an easy cop out from a charge by saying your client is mentally ill, as you can’t really disprove that they’re not. So the offender will only be served a 16th of the punishment they would’ve received. It’s unfortunate, but that’s how it is. Hope this helps.
The US Supreme Court decided that since people make mistakes, particularly cops, there should be a whoopsie card that can be played sometimes in civil court to protect the cop (or other public entity). Qualified Immunity can apply to any person acting under “color of law” to include school teachers, administrators, firefighters, and elected officials( and way more). Obviously it’s not a real card, but a theory and legal defense. You get the idea. The card can only be played in civil court, not criminal court. It can be requested to be played (by the cop or other person getting sued) and a judge (or judges) has to agree that it can be played.  The card can only played if someone’s civil rights were actually violated and those rights were not “clearly established” by law or legal precedent (precedent meaning it has been addressed in court before and a court made a legal decision on it already). The card, when allowed to be played in court, says that, yes, a cop or some other public entity screwed up and made a mistake and violated someone’s civil rights. That  person that violated the rights won’t be held liable in a federal civil court (immune from lawsuit) because the screw up was something that was not clearly established already. In essence, that person made a reasonable mistake.  When the Supreme Court came up with the idea of Qualified Immunity, it said that the idea was to protect people doing their jobs in good faith from being sued frivolously all the time. Meaning, a cop or some other public figure can do their jobs without being afraid of getting sued for anything and everything. Otherwise those public figures would not be able to do their job because they would get sued in civil court all the time for stupid stuff. The Supreme Court said that QI is not intended to be a blanket of protection for everything and does not cover cops (or others) who knowingly violate someone’s rights or reasonably should have known that those rights were clearly established.  A lot of times this gets brought up in use of force cases where the question is whether a cop used excessive force. A lot of people get confused about QI and say the courts require that the exact situation has happened before and been addressed in court. Not really the case. The right to be free from excessive force (what the courts have said is considered a seizure under the 4th Amendment) has already been clearly established.  QI is also often confused for indemnity. Indemnity or indemnification is separate and protects cops or other “color of law actors” from being held personally liable. That means if you sue a cop for something and are awarded money, that money is not paid by the cop directly. It’s usually paid by an insurance company that the police department pays for a policy to cover them. Like doctors who have to have malpractice insurance. If you sue a doctor, that money comes from their insurance company.  That’s a super broad explanation, there is a lot more to it but hope that helps.
Lethal dosage is calculated in terms of the LD50. This is the dose that statistically should kill half of the test subjects it's administered to based on body weight.  Since we obviously can't test lethality of something on humans, we use laboratory animals like mice whose biology is well known and can be compared to ours. Say you take a population of ten mice whose body weight is each 1kg. You find out after repeated trials that it takes a dose of 100mg to kill an average of five mice each time. This means the LD50 of the poison is 100mg/kg.  Scaling that up, we can say it would statistically take a 10,000mg dose to kill half of a population of 100kg humans. That would be about ten grams of poison, which isn't terribly toxic. One of the most potent toxins on earth- botulinum- has an LD50 in the nanogram (1 billionth of a gram) range.
FBI don't generally get involved in missing persons cases unless there is suspected kidnapping or person has crossed state lines, most of the missing people turn up in a few hours and adults have the right to disappear.
Its very rare that a prosecutor is able to appeal something in the US.  The following issues tend to be more academic than anything else.  Yes, they do occasionally happen, but the vast majority of prosecutors will go their entire careers without ever having filed an appeal.  In the exceedingly rare occasion when a prosecutor does file an appeal, its typically a once in a lifetime kind of deal. 1) As far as sentencing goes, they can only appeal a sentence in which there is some obvious legal error.  This would be a case in which a sentence deviates from some sort of mandatory sentence - IE, the sentence is below a mandatory minimum sentence or falls outside of mandatory sentencing guidelines.  Prosecutors cannot appeal a sentence simply because they don't like it. 2) Prosecutors cannot appeal a jury verdict. 3) Prosecutors cannot appeal a judge's dismissal unless that dismissal was due to a misapplication of the relevant law.  This would be something like the judge ruling that the law in question was unconstitutional or ruling that the indictment against the defendant didn't state a cause of action when it did.   4) Prosecutors can appeal certain pre-trial procedural issues, such as the admissibility of evidence.  This has to happen before the trial actually starts.  Once the trial starts the prosecution has effectively waived any right it may have had to appeal pre-trial rulings.   Again, a prosecution appeal of a pre-trial ruling is *much* rarer than it sounds.  Defendants don't have any obligation to the court and typically appeal any appealable issue, even if they don't have a good faith basis for the appeal.  Prosecutors *do* have obligations to the court and cannot appeal a pre-trial ruling unless they have a strong, good faith basis for believing that the ruling was in error and that the ruling *will* have effect the outcome of the trial.   In other words, for a prosecutor to challenge a pre-trial ruling the judge had to get it really, incredibly wrong *and* it had to be concerning a major issue in the case, such as if a key witness would be allowed to testify.
The relevant bit of the bill appears to be Part 2, section 10.3: >Where a refugee has entered or is present in the United Kingdom unlawfully, the additional requirement is that they can show good cause for their unlawful entry or presence. There are some lawful ways to enter a country - for example you might be legally in the UK when the situation in your home country changes, you might be eligible for a visa or you might seek asylum at an embassy or consulate. But there are any number of reasons why these might not be possible for someone. If there's no feasible way of entering the UK legally to claim asylum, you potentially have good reason to enter the country "irregularly" (it would normally be "unlawful" if it weren't for the justification). This contrasts, for example, with someone who has entered the country illegally and then at some time in the future decides to claim asylum. Now you might spot several issues with this. For example, let's say you're an Afghan woman who has been working unlawfully in the UK. Now the Taliban have taken over you decide, reasonably enough, to seek asylum. But a court is unlikely to decide that you had good reason to be in the UK. So are we going to deny this woman asylum and deport her back to Taliban run Afghanistan? If you've just arrived in the UK and you're trying to claim you had good reason to enter the UK irregularly, you might face questions over whether you had any other options, including the possibly tricky question of whether you could have claimed asylum anywhere else without breaking any laws (why did you come to the *UK*?). This is combined with greater penalties for unlawful entry, meaning that if you can't show "good cause" you're not only going to be inadmissible for asylum but face harsher punishment. *(Made a few edits for clarity and to cover situations where people could claim asylum while following regular border rules.)*
The eviction moratorium was a step taken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year to try to limit the spread of COVID. It forbade landlords in areas with high transmission rates from evicting tenants due to nonpayment of rent, which was an issue because so many Americans had lost their jobs and were struggling to make ends meet (all rent payments would be due at the end of the pandemic or when the moratorium expired). While this was great news for renters in those places who were struggling financially, it was bad for the landlords who relied on that income to support themselves.  The Supreme Court recently ruled that the CDC had overstepped its authority by issuing the order and have overturned it. Some states and cities have their own eviction moratoriums in place and those still stand, but the federal protections have been killed. It’s possible that a new federal eviction moratorium could happen, but it would have to go through Congress first.
Well, understand that "Slumlord" is a derogatory term used as catch all for bad landlords, it's not like there is a course in business school on slumlording.  But the term generally refers to the practice of renting low quality housing to low-income people and taking advantage of their desperation to avoid expense, for example necessary repairs, pest control, or preventative maintenance.  In other words, if you rent out a delipidated building and intentionally neglect any sort of required maintenance to the home with the knowledge that your tenants cannot find better housing so they are forced to accept below-standard living conditions, you are a slumlord.
A directed verdict is when a judge decides that based on the law the jury should not be asked to decide the case.  For example, if you are accused of murdering Joe Smith and Joe walks into court and says "What's this all about, I'm not dead".  The person not being dead is an absolute defense against murdering them, it doesn't matter what the other evidence is.  If it was a case of mistaken identity and now it seems you murdered somebody else, well that's another case and you'll have to be charged with that crime and have another trial. In Kyle Rittenhouse's case, Kyle claims he shot someone in self defense.  The person didn't die and testified that he had raised his own gun and advanced upon Rittenhouse.  While this strengthens the "self defense" claim, it might not be the "matter of law" sort of thing that would lead to a directed verdict.
Taking a guilty plea isn't a spur-of-the-moment decision. It's generally done as an agreement between the state and the accused as a way of lessening punishment. And on the flip-side, pleading not guilty doesn't mean you have to prove your innocence. It means you are forcing the state to prove your guilt. It's in their best interest to enforce the law (and the cops/prosecutors' best interests to have the appearance of actually catching crooks), so will make their case if they really feel you did it. If you really are innocent, the theory goes that they will not have the necessary evidence to convince the jury, and you get to walk away.
Basically, you don't want a country to use your diplomats as hostages or pawns, doing things like "You aren't buying imports from my country anymore? Well... oh no, it looks like your diplomat double parked in a super deadly danger zone, which we just created, and now she will be sent to jail for a hundred years. Perhaps you may want to reconsider your stance on imports from my country?" So, there's an agreement that diplomats are immune to criminal charges, to keep them from being used as pawns that way. If a diplomat causes an international incident, an actual crime that can be proven, then it becomes an issue for the two countries involved to resolve directly, rather than just the police. So basically, if a top diplomat commits a crime, they can't be arrested without potentially really pissing off another country, possibly starting a war. Now, if there is actual evidence and the two countries are on good terms, they will usually be able to work out a proper deal of "Oh shit, our diplomat killed someone. Yeah, she's going to jail. Sorry." but this becomes complicated if the two countries don't get along, because getting them to agree on how to handle it becomes nearly impossible.
You’re a young, dumb kid. You and your friends are at target and you pocket a pack of gum. You’re never caught, you and your friends laugh about it for years. End of story, right?  Wrong… 35 years later you have a family, a good job, you’ve never been in trouble with the law. But the police show up to your house on a Saturday morning. One of your friends told that story to someone who works for corporate Target and now they’re pressing charges. You’re charged with theft and ordered to pay back the damages+35 years of interest or spend 5 years in prison… all for a pack of gum you stole when you were 13.
>When workers go on strike, I've heard that continuing to support the business is crossing the picket line and not supportive of the workers. For example, continuing to order Amazon products when the workers are on strike. >But wouldn't continuing to order Amazon products make it more urgent for Amazon to respond to the workers demands? Like if Amazon was so overwhelmed by product purchases and couldn't get them processed/packaged/shipped/delivered because there were no workers, wouldn't that show them how necessary and important the workers are? Like how when nurses go on strike the patients continue to need medical assistance and the hospitals quickly can get overwhelmed. >I'm in a union myself but the union I'm in isn't modeled like this and there's not really a "picket line" to cross so I don't totally understand. Thanks!         These are two entirely different strikes, different goals and different proverbial picket lines that have nothing to do with each other.   A worker not striking is not supporting their fellow workers in their demands for higher wages. The business is less inclined to care about that strike if *enough* work gets done.    A customer shopping at <business> is not supporting their fellow customers in their efforts to decreases <business>'s influence and power. The business is less inclined to care about that strike if *enough* customers still frequent them.
Animal welfare is regulated at the state, not Federal level.   There is no requirement for Congress to name their acts in any particular manner.  Sometimes Congress gives the acts that it passes names that are directly related to what the act does.  Sometimes they don't.  The Animal Welfare Act was not designed to regulate animal welfare.   The Animal Welfare Act came about because the 1960's pet industry would sell off excess pets, mostly cats and dogs, to research facilities.  So if your local 1960's pet shop was selling kittens, once those kittens got too old to sell they would be shipped off to a medical lab.  The Animal Welfare Act was designed to stop that. All the act does is to prohibit that practice and to establish a regulatory framework under which medical labs can be inspected to ensure that they're not using old pet animals for experimentation.  It only covers animals that were widely being sold as pets in the 1960's - most animals are not covered by it. Its not unusual for things like that to be regulated at the state level in the US.  The Federal Government rarely gets involved in traditional law enforcement actions and animal welfare/cruelty is a traditional law enforcement action.
Basically, it was a way for some politicians to grandstand while placating some of the teeming masses.  As you noted, it doesn't really make any practical sense.  But, a few politicians gained favor (and votes) by vowing to "protect" people from "dangerous sexual predators" by forever keeping a watch over those convicted sex offenders.  In sum, the reason is "politics."
Going to get removed, but here is your answer. They didn't ban them. They just made the restrictions so tight that they are effectively banned.

So, for now, abortions are banned in Texas in every way that matters.
Baseball is a sport where a lot of power is implied to the umpiring crew to make judgment calls that determine the outcome of scoring plays in a relatively low scoring sport  *(more so than any other sport)  Example - bases loaded - in a game tied 1-1 if an umpire calls strike three on a questionable pitch - it can completely change the outcome of a game.  Compared to in NBA - if a referee calls (or doesn't) call a foul it can be the difference of 2 or 3 points in a game that ends up with a score like 102 to 99. That foul alone does not decide the impact of the game nearly as much. In football - if a referee blows a call, in many cases the coach has an opportunity to challenge the play with instant replay *(but in MLB there are many judgment calls that are not reviewable by replay. Like balls and strikes) Because the umpires have so much impact on the outcome with fewer chances for the coaches to properly appeal their decisions, there are a lot more heated arguments.
> Wouldn't it be pretty easy for eg police to find the interviewer and ask for the names of said criminal? Yup, and any smart interviewer would simply reply with "Please direct all inquiries to the production company's legal counsel" who would then reply to the police "We respectfully decline to provide any information. Have a nice day." In the US (and many other countries) you cannot be compelled to give information to the police.
Yes, the defendant can use the 5th Amendment in the USA to not incriminate themselves but if they choose to testify on behalf of the defense, they have no choice but to answer the prosecution's questions. It's all or nothing. Either they do not testify or they testify to both the defense and prosecution.  The prosecution is allowed to cross examine every witness the defense calls.
So the DEA doesn’t set the drug schedule levels, that is done by Health and Human Services (HHS).  The DEA is the enforcement arm and has no say in the eval.  The last time that list was updated/ examined was during Regan hence why none of it makes sense, cuz it’s politically driven not scientifically.  Why haven’t the feds legalized it? Ask the GOP. Conservative platform has viewed pot as some gateway drug to harder substances cuz of their political God, Regan.
Presumably because whilst that couple are at odds with each other, they could/can easily turn on the respective officer in a bid to protect one another
Roe v Wade was a court case in 1973 that reached the Supreme Court of the United States, and ruled that women in the United States have a fundamental right to get abortions, and that states can't overly regulate abortions to the point of effectively banning them.  Texas just passed a law that many people feel does just that, placing so many regulations on abortion that it may as well be illegal.  Some people fear that this is a step towards trying to get this law in front of the Supreme Court, which currently has a conservative majority, and that they could use that to make it legal for all states to heavily regulate abortion to the point where it would be effectively banned.
By "brutally tortured", one assumes you mean physical assaults and trauma to the body. Simply and bluntly put, the human body is incredibly resilient in terms of the damage it can take, and still be able to survive.  So long as blood loss is minimized, and the effects of shock mitigated, it is frightening to consider how long a person could actually survive, imo.
Decriminalization does not make it legal. Decriminalization makes it not a crime to have/use the thing (using illicit drugs as an example) while producing and selling is still a crime.  Legalization would make it "OK" to produce and distribute it.
It was discovered that he shot those folks in self-defense, and the prosecutor didn't do a great job.
It's because the f test is a ratio, and has no negative components. The f statistic is a ratio of 2 variances, and you cannot have a negative variance. If all you care about is whether they are not different from eachother, the ratio would be simply 1. Therefore, since we only care if the ratio is close enough to be 1 to 1, and the F distribution cannot be negative, then you would only use a 1 sided test because anything close to the 0 would make you say that the variances are extremely similar. Any ratio of variances beyond the upper limit would make you fail to reject the null hypothesis and say that the variances are not statistically likely to be equal. Edit: then again I might be wrong.
In it's simplest form; the Federal government cannot specifically target a given religion for special privileges, or deny that religion those privileges, on the basis of religion alone. This is pretty strictly enforced by the 1st Amendment, and is reinforced by the 14th. There's nothing wrong with a member of Congress professing their faith, or using their faith as a means to "guide their decision-making process" (i.e. get elected in more religious areas of the country), as their speech cannot be abridged, and their association with members of the same faith cannot be abridged.
It's not so much that it was his fault directly as it was a predictable consequence of his actions and the environment he fosters at his concerts. He first encouraged people to jump the fence for the concert, which increased attendance beyond the venue's capacity. This is important because venues are carefully (well, ideally at least) rated by the fire department to determine how many can safely fit. It's hard to explain in a short reddit comment, but overcrowding can easily lead to a [crowd crush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_collapses_and_crushes), where a large group of people begins to behave like a singular fluid mass and it becomes impossible for any individual to move normally. This commonly results in tramplings and suffocations, which is what killed all those people at Astroworld.  Scott also encourages his audiences to "rage," which contributes to a culture of ignoring serious issues. At Astroworld, he continued to encourage this behavior even when an ambulance was making its way through the crowd. Although, in his defense, ambulances are not entirely uncommon at large events and he probably didn't fully understand what was happening. My understanding is that this is not the first time something like this has happened at a Travis Scott concert, it's just the most severe incident, and that many other artists are much more conscientious about monitoring the crowds at their shows. So that's why everyone is mad at him.
Exactly what you’d expect, though (I can’t recall) I’m pretty sure their fingerprints are different. They use each other‘s names when being arrested, creating general confusion. The other one gets summoned to court, and comes in and claims it wasn’t him it was his twin brother. It takes awhile to get sorted. True story: Two twin brothers, both with bad raps, got busted for committing a crime together. It created such a problem at the local jail, that they moved one to a different facility in a neighboring parish (county).  At the next court date, they both appear before the judge and we notice that one of them got a prison tat’ of a cross right between his eyes. After court we all remarked, “Problem solved.”  I saw them both a few times after that for various court appearances, but at no time did the second brother get a matching tattoo. It is of no benefit to them in the long run, since it just delays the proceedings. In another case, it was two twin sisters. But only one of them had a criminal history. She kept using the “innocent“ sister‘s name and identification during arrests. The twin sister is probably still filing expungements and fighting with bureaucracy to keep her own name clear. But, after a time, because the criminal sister still operates in the same general locale, local law-enforcement became aware of the situation, and would realize the twin was telling the truth. What was more shocking is that the criminal sister looked like crap whenever she came to court, while the innocent one was always impeccably dressed and coherent. It became easy to tell them apart, and I only personally came across the two on one occasion. (25 years; Criminal Trial Attorney). 🚀
My understanding is that torture, for the most part, is a gamble. People will say anything to stop been tortured and if they are eventually free, an enemy would have been made of them. I remember reading an interesting line in A Man for All Seasons by Robert Bolt. It goes like "Every man has a price...make a man suffer then wait for him to beg for his freedom." In the end, the protagonist chose to die than compromise.
We don't know.  Currently it can't cure anything.  There is a lot of thinking that it can do this or that or fix this or that or whatever, but none of it has really panned out yet.   They've been talking about stem cells fixing spinal cord injuries for as long as I can remember, but so far, no fix.
So, what's the question?  This seems like an explanation in search of a request.
I think they do it for a few reasons: Publicity: They want people to know they exist. Legitimacy: They aren't just a ragtag group of thugs, they are an organization with some level of professionalism that is important enough to be interviewed. The human side: They want to show that they are people too. This might garner some sympathy from the public. They also ensure the leaking is kept to a minimum. Sometimes they will take the interviewer to an unknown location. They closely monitor what is recorded, etc.
Most of the ones that got cought did it either for pleasure (psychos with a power fetish), because they were crazy (mostly religious delusions like "god told me to kill them all") or because they had some sort of trauma that they projected onto a group of people (e.g. mommy hit them so now they kill women that look like mommy).
We can't measure intent. Anyone can lie and say "I didn't mean to crash my car into that nun!"  even if they actually intended murder.  We can measure outcome. A nun was killed by a drunk driver.
Proving an allegation of that level of severity would require a lot of strong evidence; if you jail someone over it before you have that evidence ready, you risk utterly botching the investigation or subsequent court proceedings and having the person walk away on technicalities. Given the number of defendants charged/arrested/facing trial/convicted, it's likely quite a few of them have been/will add more information through interrogation/interview that will potentially build up evidence as well. When you're talking about 500+ defendants, it's going to take a while to sort through everything they say and corroborate/disprove things. This applies especially when the people concerned are high-ranking public figures are involved, or wealthy citizens who can afford top notch legal support, and when a misstep could end up further fueling political violence/extremism. Federal prosecutors in particular tend not to file charges/order an arrest until they are absolutely certain a conviction will occur.
Why don’t you call the police non-emergency line and ask?
Technically the floor of a congress is NOT a place with full freedom of speech. There is a system called "parliamentary rules" that dictates who can speak when and, often, what they are allowed to speak about. These rules are a little different for every lawmaking body, but there are some common ideas. The House Speaker in Texas is able to set parliamentary rules so long as procedures are followed. That can include defining what counts as acceptable speech. The procedures to change the rules might require a vote, but if the vote passes then that's that.
It came down to OJ’s defense team making the cops look so racist that the jury couldn’t believe the mountain of evidence they put forth.
To ensure that they get a fair trial, that the investigation is carried out in accordance with the law, that mitigating circumstances are taken into account during sentencing etc.
Sometimes, the property / homeowner is forced to pay out of pocket themselves. Established case law typically means they aren't entitled to be compensated, because the police were acting to preserve the safety of the public.
It’s unusual. There’s a rule against cruel and unusual punishment. It’s on that famous piece of paper. The Bill of Rights. Or was it parchment? Anyway, the cleanup from that would be gruesome and traumatizing for the janitorial staff. People in favor of capital punishment want to make sure that they at least appear as far from barbarism as possible, so that the public will continue to support their barbaric practice.
It is illegal to have an open container in the vehicle regardless of who it belongs to because the officer has no way to verify who actually was drinking it or not.     Being an intoxicated passenger is not illegal assuming they are intoxicated on a legal substance, but it doesn't matter who's holding the container, having it open and in the vehicle at all is illegal.
Rule 2 forbids questions about politics and law.
Suspension of disbelief is a core principle of fiction. It's the idea that something is not realistic or even possible at all, but you're willing to look past that because it's still fun, interesting etc. "Suspend me in disbelief" is a play on words that suggests the author is looking for something very immersive, like well-written fantasy with strong internal consistency.
The separation of Church and State comes from two clauses in the First Amendment: you can't establish a state religion (which would include naming an existing religion to be a state religion), and you can't prohibit anyone from exercising their faith. And that's pretty much it. Representatives don't have to pretend to be atheists.
Well, you see sweety, it's when someone like me, a man, explains something blatantly obvious or simply not understood in a condescending way to someone less intellectually inclined, such as a woman, as if they have no way of understanding even the most basic of concepts, as they do. Now, hun, this can also be done without prompt from the lower IQ girl. Many men, such as myself, understand that females don't grasp things as quickly as man and we know that we have to teach them.  Basically, it's teaching the dumb how to be less dumb by being more like the geniuses.  You get it now, baby. By the way, you're so much smarter than other girls and that ass is FIIIINE
There have been cases where police, wanting to search a phone during a traffic stop, have been able to just hold it up to the persons face and have it unlock. Whether this is legal or not is still being chewed over, but at least at a practical level it’s very easy to get around biometric security if the person is physically present. Another issue with biometrics - if somehow the biometric data is compromised and able to be replicated there’s no way for the user to change their biometric. I see u/cherryreddit mentioned Angela Merkel’s fingerprint - from now on she can’t use that biometric on anything, the information is compromised and able to be replicated. Compare to having a password compromised where you can quickly change it.
They are, but RF scanning equipment for this purpose is expensive.  Criminal Justice budgets are stretched already, so many facilities may not have them.
Ultimately, it's about money.  Criminal trials can cost a lot of money--sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars, for a single trial.  If every single accused criminal in America went to trial, the nation simply couldn't afford it.  If the government can get the criminal to admit guilt, accept some punishment, and avoid a trial, then some justice is served, and the taxpayers don't have to pay as much money.  It's not a perfect system, but like most things in life, in the end, it's all about the Benjamins.
Could they? Yes. Will they? Nope, you’ll just continue to add charges to your list.
The jury is responsible for deciding which charges the suspect is guilty of, if any. The judge then decides how serious the sentencing will be based on that. So if the jury says a guy is innocent of a million charges, the judge doesn't get to sentence the person. If the jury says the person is guilty on one charge, the judge gets to issue a sentence based on what the law says a person can be sentenced to for that crime.
They don't. The companies that own the media are the ones spending time and resources on finding the people pirating their media, not the government.
Occam's razor is a sort of statistical rule - the fewer things you must assume, the more likely your explanation is. For an example, let's imagine you have an uncle who is a known alcoholic and who is known to spend lots of money on gambling when drunk. He is also known to lie to hide this. This uncle shows up to your house, reeking of booze, and asking for money. He claims his wallet was stolen and he fell in a puddle of whiskey. Is this possible? Sure. But you're assuming that his wallet was stolen, and you're assuming that he's telling the truth, and you're assuming that he also happened to fall in a puddle of booze. These are unrelated assumptions - each is improbable and each one unlikely. Or maybe he just relapsed. The only major assumption you make here is that he relapsed. Everything else is probable following that. This explanation is therefore more probable.
Police are local/municipal law enforcement that enforce state and local laws. FBI is the federal law enforcement agency, that enforced federal crime. There may be times where local police and FBI cooperate because of joint jurisdiction (say a gang that's selling drugs imported from elsewhere, involved in local shootings, money laundering/tax evasion, etc.) CIA is foreign intelligence (ie. spies). They operate outside the U.S.
They don't get to jail you if they *think* you're lying.  Your disability status won't be determined by your application.  You'll have to show proof (doctors tests and results) to confirm.
It’s just tradition, and shows respect to the judge but also serves to draw focus to the matters at hand and quiet the room.
Laws are enforced by the government and police force. In the past, laws would have been enforced formally or informally by other members of your community. If I get together with a bunch of people, we could all decide that stealing is wrong. We could then agree on a punishment for stealing. If someone tries to steal, the rest of the society would band together to enforce this punishment. I'm incentivized to not steal because the consequences of stealing are worse than the benefits I'd gain.
A good plot twists hides the important things in the details. E.g. on the first day the narrator walks a trail and takes 10 mins, the next day they start walking when the bell strikes 3, then barely made it in time at the end of the trail to a 3:30 tea party. The author could make some spectacle at the tea party to distract you from the time. They've hidden the fact that the narrator must have done something in that 20 mins in the story without drawing your attention. Once you know what happens in the 20 mins,  that 20 mins will stick out like a sore thumb because now you know to look for it. A bad plot twist just comes out from nowhere and is a deus ex machina.
You have to keep some kind of documentation to keep up with the details of large scale operations or specific well vetted violent crimes. You could leave a trail of fake documentation that could somehow call it all into question or to back up a later claim, but you'd have to be knowledgeable in police protocol and smart enough to think that many moves ahead and most criminals are not as smart as they may seem. It takes a a lack of empathy and emotional intelligence to hurt other people. They aren't usually smart enough to think of something that would get them out of everything and also lone up with timelines and other evidences, and if they are they'd have movies made about them again and again
I really doubt that this could be described with out adding in some bias. The gist of it is during rioting in Kenosha, WI one of Kyle’s friends was asked to provide security to a local business so that they would not have anymore property damage. Kyle was there to provide security and medical help if needed. During the night Kyle headed to a different location that the owners had to help with putting out fires. It was at this time he had some sort of run in with a Joshua Zaminski and Joseph Rosenbaum. Zaminski fired a shot in the air while Rosenbaum grabbed for Kyle’s rifle it was at this time that Kyle fired four shots hitting and killing Rosenbaum. A crowd was now gathering and started to chase Kyle. Kyle started to flee trying to turn himself into the police. He fell while running, was kicked in the head by an unsend assailant, he deflected a hit with a skate board by Anthony Huber. Huber also tried to wrestle the rifle away from Kyle, however Kyle fired one more time striking and killing Huber. It was when Kyle was getting up that a Mr. Grosskreutz approached Kyle. Kyle pointed his rifle at Grosskreutz but did not fire as Grosskreutz had his hands up. Grosskreutz then raised a pistol at Kyle who fired first hitting Grosskreutz in the arm. Kyle then left the scene looking to turn himself in. Kenosha police did not take him in, but the next morning he turned himself into the Antioch police.  With all that said the state had basically charged Kyle with murder for the two men he shot, attempted murd for Mr. Grosskreutz, reckless endangerment for firing a weapon at Grosskreutz, illegal possession  of a weapon by a minor, curfew violation. Those are things I remember off the top of my head. Kyle has claimed that he acted in self defense. So this trial is to determine Kyle’s guilt or innocence in this shooting.
traditionally, sensors can engage in unlimited debate. Unlimited by logic or time. The session of the senate is limited by time so if there is a fillibuster then nothing else gets done for the duration. Imagine if you went to a buffet limited by time. Instead of eating you decide to engage in a rhetorical debate about forks versus chopsticks. At the end, you leave hungry and still nobody cares about chopsticks versus forks. Some of the more bizarre tactics used in the past were reading cookbooks, phone books, and Dr Seuss.
Answer: It depends on what the restraining order says and how far apart you will be from them. If you are in a building that has multiple businesses in it and you have legitimate business in one that is not where the complaint is, you should be fine. However, if you are in some place like a Walmart or a bar, restaurant or nightclub, you must leave because there is the possibility that you may violate the order. There may be nothing that says that in the order specifically, but, if the complaintant went to the effort of getting the restraining order and the court issued it, it would be in your best interest to leave. Basically, you must adhere to the spirit of the law, which is that you are to stay a reasonable distance away from the complaintant. It's better to leave then end up in jail.
“Do you solemnly affirm that the testimony you are about to give…” you don’t have to put your hand in anything. Just raise one.
For the best answer, you should talk to a lawyer. The laws surrounding this can be different in every city, let alone every state, country, or other legal subdivision of power.  But in general, if your name was on the lease you are equally responsible for that debt. If you contact the person you owe money and explain the story, they *may* choose to set up some kind of alternate arrangement, especially if you can somehow coerce the other person to pay some or all of the debt.  But in general, the agreement on paper is what matters and verbal agreements do not hold much legal power. Depending on your current employment situation it *might* still be true that he has more responsibility than you.  But the right way to go about this involves a lawyer. They know the law, know what you are liable for, and may know what legal remedies you have. This is particularly advantageous for you if you have a lawyer and your ex doesn't.  But getting a lawyer doesn't guarantee you don't have to pay anything. It only guarantees somebody who is more likely to understand your legal options is on the hook to help you navigate.
Almost every civilized society has done away with the death penalty because it’s entirely possible that you’ll falsely convict someone, and if you’ve already executed them, you can’t un-execute them. In those few countries that still execute people, they have mandatory appeals and reviews of sentences, to try to cut down on the possibility of the state murdering an innocent person.
Answer: Keep in mind this is coming from someone without any formal legal background. This is a write up with facts from the trial.  Rittenhouse is a 17-year-old dude from Illinois. I forget what city, but it is quite close to the IL-WI border. He's worked in Kenosha, he has family and friends who live in Kenosha. I believe he said he gave money to an older friend of his (Dominic Black) to buy an AR rifle. This firearm never left the state of Wisconsin and was only ever possessed by Rittenhouse when Black was also present. On the 25th, Rittenhouse was given the rifle by Black. Rittenhouse was not an EMT, however was an EMT cadet with his local fire department and had some basic EMT and medical training. He and several friends went to Kenosha essentially to look after the community after seeing the destruction the night before due to riots occurring because of the Jacob Blake shooting. An owner of a used car lot called Car Source asked for protection (from people he knew and ultimately became Rittenhouse and his friends) of his business after seeing every car burned at another location. They agreed and mostly remained around this location. During the day, Rittenhouse got a sling for his rifle so it was attached to his body. This made it so he would not have to set the rifle down or be able to be stolen while he gave someone medical attention or handled a fire extinguisher. Later, a police line essentially moved them from the Car Source. During the night, Rittenhouse and his accomplices put out dumpster fires and gave medical attention to some people with minor injuries. A man, Rosenbaum, was seen being very aggressive towards Rittenhouse and his accomplices. Rosenbaum even made threats at Rittenhouse twice. One time where he said something close to "if I catch you alone I'll kill you." He also yelled (as a white man) "shoot me n•••a! shoot me n•••a!" At other similarly armed men. Rosenbaum also becomes angry and aggressive when a dumpster fire is put out. Later, Rittenhouse believes he is walking with a friend, but loses him, making him alone. The first shots: Rittenhouse, alone, finds himself being chased by Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum yells "fuck you!" at him and throws what I believe is an empty plastic bag in his direction. A man nearby shoots 2 rounds into the air. Rittenhouse reacts, unsure where they came from, he turns towards Rosenbaum, who is charging Rittenhouse, and Rittenhouse points his rifle at Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum does not stop. Rittenhouse runs again, to find himself somewhat cornered because of some parked cars and other protestors. Rittenhouse stops when cornered and turns around, once turned around, Rosenbaum lunges at Rittenhouse, grabbing for his rifle. Rittenhouse fires 4 rounds very quickly one after another. These rounds killed Rosenbaum. You may hear that Rosenbaum was shot in the back. Although true, this is misleading. This round goes into his back entering his body closer to his head and the bullet goes down his body as if he was shot from above. This shot goes into his back this way because Rosenbaum is horizontal as he lunges at Rittenhouse and his body is lower than the rifle when this bullet is shot. I hope that makes sense. Rittenhouse stays for a brief second, and calls his friend, Black, for a few seconds to tell him he shot someone because he had to. His call was cut short when a mob begin to chase him while threatening him and throwing things at him. Of course, Rittenhouse runs away. Rittenhouse begins running towards the police line to turn himself in. After running down the street followed by a mob of angry, aggressive, and threatening demonstrators, Rittenhouse trips and falls due to being lightheaded from a combination of running and being struck in the head by a concrete rock. When having fallen down, an unknown man kicks Rittenhouse in the face. Rittenhouse fires 2 shots at him as he is being kicked, both miss, this man runs away. Very shortly after, Rittenhouse is struck in the back of the neck/upper back with a skateboard by a man named Huber. Huber sort of runs over Rittenhouse's prone body after this, while also grabbing for Rittenhouse's rifle. Rittenhouse fires a round into his chest as Huber is on top of him, proving fatal for Huber. Simultaneously, another man, Grosskreutz is running after Rittenhouse as well. Grosskreutz also has an illegally possessed handgun in his hand. Grosskreutz stops advancing towards Rittenhouse (once he is around 3-4 feet away) because of Rittenhouse's shot at Huber. This causes Grosskreutz to stop and put his hands up, still keeping his handgun in his hand. Rittenhouse sees him quickly after shooting Huber and points his rifle at Grosskreutz, which is also why Grosskreutz put his hands up. However, I believe (based on video) that since Grosskreutz stops and puts his hands up, Rittenhouse begins to slightly lower his rifle. Grosskreutz testified that Rittenhosue "reracked" (also known as rechambering) the rifle at this time. Rittenhouse disputed this in court and I believe video evidence shows that this never happened. Once Rittenhouse sort of slightly lowers his rifle, Grosskreutz (to his own admission and testimony) lunges at Rittenhouse and points his handgun at Rittenhouse's head. Rittenhouse is quick enough to shoot Grosskreutz before Grosskreutz is able to advance any further. He hits Grosskreutz's bicep, damaging his arm severely. Grosskreutz runs away seeking medical attention and lives to tell the story. For this shooting, I want to emphasize (because this is pretty key) that Grosskreutz admitted in his testimony that Rittenhouse did not shoot him until he lunged at Rittenhouse, dropped his arms, and pointed his handgun at Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse gets up and advances towards the police, putting his hands up when he approaches trying to turn himself in. The officer (who is in his squad car) who is being approached by Rittenhouse, orders Rittenhouse to stay back, pepper sprays Rittenhouse, and tells Rittenhouse to go home. Rittenhouse goes home in Illinois where he explained to his mother what happened. Rittenhouse goes to his local police station to turn himself in, driven by his mother. He arrives at the police station less than an hour after the shooting. The big thing part comes in protecting self defense as this case could cause precedent.
Marijuana being illegal in the US was mostly done as a way of making it easier to arrest black people, or counterculture rebels, who were more likely to smoke marijuana than tobacco. They couldn't make it illegal to be a hippie, or to be black, but they could make it illegal to smoke marijuana and arrest people in those communities. Likewise, the idea that tobacco was bad for your health didn't become common knowledge until a point in which a majority of people were already smoking tobacco. They didn't want to ban something they were addicted to already.
That's not an actual legal principle, but the idea is that if two people go to court over ownership of an item, the holder only has to say "I own this and I've always owned this."  The non-holder will have to prove that they truly owned the item, that their item was the same item as the one currently possessed, and that the item unlawfully ended up in the possession of the other person.  Unless there's really good evidence (receipts, serial numbers, eyewitness testimony, security cameras, etc.), the non-holder will have a hard time meeting the burden of proof.  When it's just he-says-she-says, the holder wins by default.
Everyone would leave, and you’re supreme glorious leader of a plot of untilled dirt. Dictatorships need both a ruling class and a class to be ruled.  The underclass is exploited to enrich the ruling class and ensure their loyalty to the “cause”.  With nobody left to do any work, it would immediately crumble. That’s why North Korean and East German guards watch their own side of the border, not the enemy side.
Age of consent is basically the definition of age from which person is able to consent. Meaning that people below the age of consent cant actually consent to sex. Where I am from, 16 would be above the age of consent for 18 year old, however it isnt true for every country.
Gas chambers come in both types known as poison gas chambers or asphyxiant gas chambers. But, in general, gas chambers are complex and inefficient, regardless of which type you use. In the US, there have only been 11 executions by gas chamber since 1976.
Some people are under the impression that all illegal things are crimes. Not true. Crimes are specifically those offenses that can land you in jail. Things like traffic tickets are what you could call a "civil infraction" and are only punishable with fines and other less severe consequences. So to take possession of marijuana, for instance, decriminalizing it would turn it from something they could arrest you for, into something you'd get ticketed for.
Because there's no such thing. A [polygraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph) is a device that measures several physiological indicators such as heart rate and blood pressure, which ostensibly can be used to detect lies.... except that it can't. It's basically used as a tactic to extract a confession. See [this Adam Ruins Everything clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyDMoGjKvNk).
They aren't legally allowed to share anything, legal professional privilege (sometimes called attorney client privilege) protects all communications between a professional legal adviser (a solicitor, barrister or attorney) and their clients from being disclosed without the permission of the client. The privilege is that of the client and not that of the lawyer. So if you sent your lawyer a letter with details of all of your crimes in order to secure legal advice, they cannot release that without your permission.
How black were you going when you got stopped?
Self-litigants may... * have a lack of knowledge, experience, insight * have a lack of cool-headed objectivity about their own case
Last Week Tonight with John Oliver has a fantastic video on this, but here's the TL;DW version: When a person is charged with a crime, the state must ensure a fair and open trial. The defendant is owed a jury of their peers, due process, etc. In civil asset forfeiture, the government charges *your stuff* with a crime. Since intimate objects aren't people, the government can pull a lot of legal shenanigans.
By using legalese, basically. Rather than outright banning abortions after six weeks, the Texas law just allows any Texas resident with "no vested interest" to sue a doctor or clinic who aids with an abortion after the six-week link. So it's not actually the government of the State that's preventing the abortion occurring, it's just random "concerned citizens" who are doing that, and thus Roe vs Wade does not apply. This is obviously arrant sophistry and is undergoing challenge in the courts, AFAIK, but no outcome as yet.
The FDA is responsible for protecting public health by making sure food and drugs are safe for consumption, the CDC focuses on disease prevention and research.  They're very different and there's not much that would make them even appear similar.
Libel.  If you're basically saying that this is X case and person Y said or did thing Z then person Y can sue you for libel if they didn't.  A disclaimer at the start of the episode can be pointed to so that it is clear this wasn't intended to say that person Y said or did thing Z. Also, while often inspired by things that actually happened, or wanting to kind of explore an idea from a case more closely (say the OJ thing where a murderer writes a book about it after being acquitted), they usually don't actually want to follow the real details of a case as they are not trying to be a true crime show.
It sounds worse than it is. In the Westminster system of parliament, you having to dissolve the parliament prior to having an election. In sense, the Queen (or Governor General) fires all the members of parliament. Keep in mind, the Queen or the GC does not do so unless the Primer Minister asks (in recent times). In order to replace those members, there needs to be an election. Now, the those who were "fired" can run for election and be re-elected, or new MPs can take their place. The whole procedure is more symbolic than anything else. Now, you may ask how the country can still exist without current members of Parliament? In reality, most of the government is run by the departments, and those remain unchanged. Parliament only meets a few times a year, so this period of dissolved parliament might go unnoticed in terms of actually running the country. Even after the election, the Parliament probably won't meet for official business until a few weeks afterwards. So, whenever you hear that parliament was dissolved, it only means that the first step was taken for a upcoming election.
He was convicted of felony murder. If you are engaged in the commission of a felony offense and someone dies during the commission of that felony you are guilty of the crime of felony murder, irrespective of your intent.
Pleading "not guilty" is largely just a formality; a lot of these legal matters (including making a plea deal, if appropriate) either can't or just don't happen until after court proceedings actually begin, and that usually starts with a hearing where you enter an initial plea. Not to mention; the state has legal limits placed upon it, such that if their evidence is collected unlawfully the defendant has the ability to render that evidence inadmissible at trial. It is not enough for the state to *know* that a person is guilty; they have to prove it along strictly defined procedural grounds.
They do it in case one of the other sentences is overturned later on. So if you go out and murder three people and are found guilty you might get three life sentences…. But then an appeals court is like: “ _actually_ …with this first murder the cops mishandled the evidence… so we’re throwing it out.” Well… if you didn’t have those other two life sentences we’d have to let you out of prison. As it is though- you can stay in prison and serve out your second life sentence instead and we don’t need to bother re-trying you on the first one
Newspaper editor here. This is actually not best practice except where it's part of the story—for example, if there is a racial element to a crime, or a description of a wanted person still being sought. Of course, whether race is part of a story can often be a hotly debated topic. This also feeds into a larger discussion happening in journalism right now about how we handle crime reporting generally. For example, many newspapers are simply not running the press releases we get from law enforcement about arrests for minor crimes, especially before a conviction.
>Aren't there requirements to remove firing pins in assault rifles when crossing state lines? No. >how an underaged kid crossed state lines with an assault rifle Its lawful to travel between different states in the US.  In his case, he lived in an urban area divided by the Illinois/Wisconsin border.  It was a ~20 minute drive from his house to where the incident took place and he had a part time job that he worked nearby. >Are there videos of this? Plenty. >I'm clueless. Please help. There were riots in Kenosha that had caused significant damage to a car dealership the night before the incident occurred.  The owner of the car dealership asked a family friend to help clean up and protect the dealership on the following night.  The family friend was Rittenhouse's friend and asked him to help. When Rittenhouse showed up he was surrounded by rioters.  One of them, a convicted 9 time child molester with a history of serious mental illness who had been released from a psychiatric hospital that morning, charged Rittenhouse and grabbed his gun.  Rittenhouse shot him. A mob then chased Rittenhouse several blocks.  He was then knocked to the ground by a second rioter with a history of violent crime.  While he was on the ground, a third rioter began beating him with a skateboard.  The third rioter then grabbed his gun, at which point Rittenhouse shot him. A forth rioter was carrying a Glock.  Rittenhouse pointed his gun at the forth rioter, at which point the forth rioter put his hands up as if to surrender.  When Rittenhouse lowered his gun, the forth rioter began aiming the Glock at him, at which point Rittenhouse shot him. Every step of this was documented on video, all of which is readily available on the internet.  Its one of the clearest cut self defense cases in US history.  Under normal circumstances the prosecutor would be disbarred for bringing it.  He still might be.
The defendant will declare bankruptcy, and the assets will be sold and given to the plaintiff, then the rest of the debt will be wiped off.
It's a call for reallocating money spent on police to other agencies that could deal with the problems. It varies to different degrees on how to "defund" them to from reducing funding to completely abolishing police forces. It's because 9/10 calls for police are non-violent encounters and a police officer's skillset are not often in sync with many of the social interactions that they deal with. A lot of the times it asks for them to shift to funding of social services to improve to reduce the need for police in general, such as helping mental health and homelessness.
Because the law is very clear and simple - any male between the age of 18 to 25 must register for Selective Service. The purpose of Selective Service isn't to screen people for military service outright, it is to have a database or registry of people who can be summoned to *report* for screening if there were a serious need for more people in the military. Just registering for Selective Service does not mean you are qualified or eligible to serve in the military. Also you say you "wouldn't be able to" get past a phone call with a recruiter, which implies that you haven't tried? There are waivers for all sorts of medical conditions in the military, so just because on paper your "minor medical condition" disqualifies you, that doesn't actually mean you would be disqualified.
Yeah, contempt of court can lead to fines and spending time in jail until you comply. In civil trials they can also assume an adverse inference. Basically, if you don't hand over the evidence the judge/jury can assume it would show you're in the wrong.
They kept the sample cards indexed by various print characteristics, and manually compared them. A blind search on a fingerprint with no other details was practically impossible and would involve trained staff examining them one by one. If they had a list of suspects or other evidence to go on it would help to confirm or eliminate suspects, but it wasn't intended to be a "find this print amongst the millions" system.
Example: Company A is selling services to company B outside of their permitted region.  Company A is subject to punitive action. vs Employee A is selling services to company B outside of their permitted region (which is prohibited by the policy of his employer, Company A) .  Employee A is subject to punitive action.
The same way the last official declared war was WWII. Officially declaring war gets messy quick, so the president uses executive orders to effectively declare war and move troops without Congress officially getting their hands dirty.
Officially? A lawmakers job is to author/sponsor bills. Those bills are then considered by the relevant subcommittee. That group is the first to look at the bill and can either kill it or pass it on to the full legislative body for a vote. Gosar was stripped of his committee assignments, so he can no longer influence what bills are considered and the conversation around them. Gosar is not a serious lawmaker, so this probably doesn't affect his day to day  Unofficially? Censure carries a sense of shame. Something Republicans no longer have. Gosar has already reposted the video that lead to his censure in the first place. He'll fundraise off of it and make money.
Pot doesn’t enhance an athlete’s performance, it just enhances the parties they go to after the game.  The only reason it’s a banned substance is that it’s still illegal in some states and federally.
It speaks to intent, and ability to stop. Drug addicts made a mistake getting addicted to drugs and aren't thinking clearly; the drug dealer knows full well what they're doing, and knows it's going to hurt people, but they do it anyway.  It's... Simplified.
labor unions are a great place to practice extortion - you moblize a large amount of people at once   - Instant influence   - set up infrastrcutre, they usually of their own offices, also legal departments or lawyers on retainer.   so basically you can extort business owners for "protection fees" becuase with the union under your control you can take their workforce away or break any condition negotiations in an instant, or imagen you´re building a building or housing block and suddently the union is "well, some of the concrete that was due today might come next week due to you being short on union fees" also there are important unions like dock workers, truck drivers, sanitary services which allow you to automatically gain access to transport, customs control, building access, city infrastrcutre access.  Its basically a gold mind for organized crime,
Supposing you catch someone in the act with a knife to their throat or something, it would be great if there was some incentive for them to give up rather than go ahead with the killing because it was the same punishment either way.  Beyond that there is a general principle that the punishment should fit the crime, that the penalty should scale roughly with the harm inflicted. Actually killing someone is worse than just trying, so the penalty should be less.
He did some stuff.  He was charged with some crimes, and plans a self-defense justifications for his actions.  Both sides will present evidence to a jury in a proceeding controlled by an impartial expert judge.  After the jury decides, there may be appeals by either side if they don't like the outcome. It will take 2-5 years to settle out, but it's a complex process to maximize fairness.
They are not admissible as evidence of anything. They are just a scare tactic used in interrogations (in the US). Their effectiveness as such is built on the myth that they are accurate.
Depends on the crime. In a friend's case, she had no reason to know that getting a haircut without the express permission of her father or husband was even illegal.  No, she wasn't arrested. Most of the local police don't know about that law either.
There is supposed to be some level of consistency, equal application of law for all. So if a precedent has been set, was thought out and decided and had withstood time and appeals, then it’s a good ruling to look at for guiding future rulings in similar cases.
Its too easy to get emotionally invested in your own case, and to make bad legal decisions as a result. In theory, having a lawyer that's detached from the situation will result in you making smarter legal decisions.
Depends on the circumstances and the charges. If it's just a traffic ticket, the judge will tell you to pay X fine and that's it.  If it's a criminal matter, the judge may pick a separate date for the sentencing hearing. Then proceed to the next case.
The United States Constitution prohibits "ex post facto" law.  This means that the government isn't allowed to make *retroactive* changes to the law.  (Otherwise, if the government didn't like you--like, say, if you were a political candidate in the opposition party--they could just outlaw something you'd already done and then arrest you for it.) What matters legally is whether a person's behavior was criminal *at the time they performed it*. Sometimes the state governor or national president will pardon people who are in prison for things that are no longer crimes, but pardoning is an executive action and not a legislative one.  In fact, legally speaking, accepting a pardon is a confession of guilt: someone cannot be pardoned for behavior that was not criminal.
Like most laws, "It seemed like a good idea at the time."  There is no requirement that laws be logically constructed, and many are the results of specific historical issues. Countries have two competing demographic forces: citizens having children and immigration; to offset the fact that people die every day.  Attempting to control citizens having children is highly problematic, difficult, and has a long track record of ending badly. So, that leaves immigration as the only knob that governments can control.  Immigrants often tend to be younger than the average citizen, and if they can move into the country and then have children it can be doubly beneficial in increasing the young population of a country. Immigrants also might be skilled, and the country they immigrate to gets the benefit of those skills while having paid none of the costs to educate the immigrant.  Another possibility for advantage. On the flip side, some immigrants are refugees from disastrous failed states which have not prepared them with valuable skills. These immigrants can cost more than the benefit they give the society, so governments seek to reduce the number of such immigrants if more desirable ones are available.
Texas can't actually make abortion illegal because that goes against a couple of Supreme Court decisions that prevent states from outlawing abortion. What they are doing instead is trying to work around this prohibition. Instead of the state arresting people for abortion after six weeks (when the fetus has a heartbeat), the state will allow any citizen, who is not a working member of the state (no police, no state attorneys, etc.) to report people who get abortions or assist people getting abortions. These people will essentially sue those procuring abortions and may receive $10,000 for doing so. This reporting people and getting a cash reward is what people are calling a bounty against abortion. This is intended to discourage abortions without making them actually illegal.
The supreme court has ruled on several occasions that "obscenity" is not protected by the First Amendment, including in Roth v. United States (1957), Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964), and Miller v. California (1973).
Such sentences are often the sum of multiple sentences for multiple crimes.    Just because one conviction would result in a life sentence doesn't mean the justice system will ignore any others. This kind of result also may make parole difficult/impossible and reduce the possibility of a single overturned conviction freeing the individual
Laws concerning the detention of suspects vary by state, and *Brooklyn Nine-Nine* is one of the least accurate of all police shows — you should never take it as anything but a comedy produced by people with no experience in law enforcement. That said: In general, there is nothing preventing law enforcement from charging a person after they’ve already been detained and released.
This can be complicated because it depends on what the judge actually declares. In newspapers they don't report the details but the actual ruling might be fairly narrow - ie only parts of the law might be deemed unenforceable. So, in many cases, parts of the law might go into effect while the offending parts cannot be enforced. It almost always never stops here. The lawyers representing the government will appeal any adverse ruling. This then might be argued at the next level of the court system.  The judge cannot order that the law be rewritten (under separation of powers, the judiciary doesn't have the authority to command the legislature to make laws). If the legislative body wishes to pass another bill to better address the issues brought up by the judge, it is up to them.
You can still be fired if you are not doing your job, so if you abuse this and don't do your work, it won't go well. The idea is to give employees flexibility and freedom, which can make one happier in one's job, and thus boost productivity. It's also a massive perk so can help draw in top talent at potentially a lower cost.  I imagine it doesn't work in a lot of industries however.
Prison I work at issues 4 razors a month to inmates. To receive razors the next month a razor must be turned back in. They are nit allowed to buy razors and what is issued is single blade. If open blades are found in their cells it is a weapons charge.
You're going to need to provide actual examples rather than hypothetical ones if you want a real answer. The phenomenon you're talking about is more of a bogeyman created by viral media that misreports complex cases. Judges are generally actually sensible and as far as I can tell, other than a few rare cases, patently absurd litigation *doesn't* make it far in the courts. These meme cases and hysteria about being sued has been around as long as I can remember. I don't believe it's ever constituted an actual problem.
Because that is a poor reason to have a law. "I don't see anything wrong with it" isn't a reason to have a law. "This law address a specific, real problem that exists" is a reason to have a law. So, what is the specific, real problem that exists, that "Voter ID Laws" address? Also consider that, unless this law does absolutely nothing, then the result will be some people that can vote now won't be able to vote after the law is passed. You will be disenfranchising a group of people. On what basis do you disenfranchise them? To gain what?
You are asking a very generic question here. It is not uncommon for software to include its name and version as metadata in the files it creates. Sometimes you might even get some identified that can be traced back to the license or computer it runs on. Even if this metadata is not present or if they are removed there might be certain characteristics about the software that can be identified. For example different CAD software will come up with different tool paths and this might be visible in the manufactured product. Sometimes these might even be deliberately added to make it easier to combat pirates. But it all depends a lot of what specific things the applications make and what you do with it.
Networks and devices can only handle so much bandwidth. Once this capacity has been reached the network will start blocking out requests, or the requests will simply slow down the network to a point of no longer functioning.  A DDoS attack is a distributed denial of service attack which utilizes compromised computers to target another machine with a bunch of requests. If you have a bot army (a bunch of hacked machines) you can effectively DDoS a network or device.
Often it is experience. If you’ve seen a case or similar case 30 times before You’re more familiar with the specific laws in play, and/or how those laws could be interpreted or twisted. Or in the case of a jury trial what kind of perspective that can convince a jury that maybe the defendant didn’t really do what they were charged with. Like getting a reduced sentence because obviously “you didn’t INTEND to do something illegal, it was just an unfortunate accident.” This is why you get different kinds of lawyers, divorce lawyers, insurance lawyers, criminal lawyers, tax lawyers. Because nothing beats them just having experience in the field.
After you call the police, you can help the person to safety.  If you are attacked, you can defend yourself.  The "sneak counter attack" is problematic.
Not a lawyer, but if I recall correctly, 2nd degree is a deliberate murder with prior motive, a crime of opportunity rather than planned in advance. For example you find the neighbor you’ve been feuding with for ages, and there’s a convenient weapon just lying there. Voluntary manslaughter is when you could have taken an action to avoid killing someone, but willingly chose not to - such as swerving or braking to not run over a pedestrian.
Anything you say in the presence of a police officer can be used against you in court. People, especially those without a thorough knowledge of the legal system, can talk themselves into trouble or make statements that may be miscontrued later in court. Generally, the best strategy is to not say anything until you have the opportunity to talk to a lawyer and discuss exactly what information to disclose and how to word your statements. The fifth amendment provides the ability to refuse to answer questions while under arrest and protects you from having to testify against yourself in court. It's important to note that it only protects you from self-incrimination. You can still be subpoenaed to testify against another person.
Starting with civil law, it's law that talks about relationships between people in a community (two private citizens, companies, etc.). Your landlord taking you to court for failing to pay your rent is an example of the landlord using civil law to get money they are owed. Usually the victim has to file a suit against the offender to initiate action. If the landlord is OK with you not paying rent for six months, the state is not going to step in and say "Hey, this guy didn't pay rent for six months, we are going to take him to court for you!"  Criminal law is usually about harsher things - murder, theft, destruction of property, assault. Stuff that, if you commit the crime, the state *will* initiate a suit against you and the possible consequences include jail time and fines and stuff like that.
Because if the burglar doesn't hear the alarm there's every chance that he'll just leave after stealing a lot of your possessions, before police gets there. The main purpose of a residential burglar alarm isn't getting the burglar arrested. It's protecting your property, and the most effective way to that is to scare off the burglar before they have **any** time to pocket valuables
A psychologist is a mental health professional who specializes in testing for and diagnosing mental health issues, disorders. They can be counselors, but not always. They're the ones having you do some tests to figure out what might be bothering you. Counselors specialize in treating those issues through therapy and provide a more general, base level of mental health care that may not necessarily cover disorders. They're the ones you talk to and tell about your issues and can help you work through them. Social workers have a lot of overlap with counselors, and can provide counseling and therapy, but are more focused on getting their patients and their families aid and resources to help them succeed. Social workers help the family sign up for benefits like food stamps, find programs that might provide child care or respite, and just generally has tools to get patients the resources they might need. The three are like three circles in a Venn diagram. There's a lot of overlap, but there's unique differences to all. I'm currently in college to get my degree in mental health Social Work. I will be able to provide counseling and therapy to some degree (less so than a full counselor though,) but also help people get what they need as well. Hope that helps some.
Traditionally it was supposed to represent that justice would be “blind to status” as in not being swayed by power or wealth, etc. I can’t really agree to that tradition being carried today but that’s another story….
Because logic doesn't apply in the American judicial system.  It's the same reason the police can sic a dog on someone who is terrified of dogs, then charge them with assaulting the police dog.
If someone has a medical issue in jail then they'll call the appropriate medical personnel to deal with it. Or not. People die in jail from medical emergencies all the time. It's not a particularly high priority for them, though.
>I always believed you had to comply when served a subpoena. You do. A subpoena is a legal document ordering you to attend and produce something. >If all your refusal does is Possibly get you, at most (?) a year or so if found to be in contempt of court, why would anybody ever be willing to comply with the subpoena? At least in the state of Virginia, generally speaking, >Each day any violation of such court-issued subpoena, court order, or Commission-issued subpoena continues shall be deemed to be **a separate offense**. So each day you don't comply is an additional (up to a) year in jail, up to a $2500 fine, or both.
1) Laws exist that make it harder for LE to use the tools they have. They aren't just monitoring everything (in theory). 2) The resources needed to investigate and follow leads, etc., is more than we spend. 3) They go analog - deaddrops and snail mail, runners, etc. 4) Pay off the government and local officials. 5) Bury the illegal stuff in legal stuff i.e. money laundering, shell corps, offshore accounts, etc. Pay for good lawyers and accountants.
Yes. Once something enters the public domain, it is no longer protected by copyright, and derivative works can be created without permission.
You're able to tell your attorney ANYTHING. You should be honest because your attorney will still fight your case. Even if someone committed a crime, sometimes procedure isn't followed and it's not legal to prosecute because of it. It's not the defense attorneys job to prove you didn't do something. It's the prosecutions job to prove you did.
the point is trust, unless you went out of their way to find it out you were likely told this secret in confidence that you could keep it to yourself.  if your 1st response is "why cant i blackmail you?" then you shouldn't expect people to tell you anything even if you should know. is this sort of mindset that gives validity to the saying:  "the only way 2 people can keep a secret is if one of them is Dead."
That's not the reason for "no cameras".  It's to reduce the benefit to the lawyers behaving badly, saying things because they want them reported on the nightly news, even though the judge tells the jury to ignore them. If you think of the trials that have had cameras, like OJ Simpson, the cameras led to a circus atmosphere, it was very bad. But, the TV reporters need pictures, TV is a visual medium, and artists are literally "the least they can allow" in terms of pictures.
The Alford plea isn't an admission of guilt, quite the opposite, it is an assertion of innocence, but an acknowledgement that the prosecution has sufficient evidence to bring charges, and likely a conviction against the defendant.  This is usually used in plea bargaining to receive a sentence for a lesser charge, while still maintaining the assertion of innocence.  It's a hail Mary type of plea, usually, to avoid a case going to trial and likely being lost.
It depends on the court. If the lawyer can show that they have made a descent effort to contact the defendent then the court may help out. For example by sending the bailif to serve the papers, sending the papers as special delivery mail or nailing the papers to the front door. So by then the papers are considered served even though you might not actually have a signature from the defendent. Avoiding the papers will only delay the court and not avoid it entirely. And if you do not show up for the court then there will be a warrent out for your arrest.
Insurance companies have criteria that need to be met in order to pay for a procedure, medication, etc. In a pre-auth, they’re sent info about the case from the physician’s office. Lab work #’s, what other meds have been tried, that sort of thing, and then if their set criteria are met based on that information from the physician, they’ll approve the procedure, medication, etc.
I watched a bit of Rekieta’s stream on the verdict, he explains it well. If I understood it correctly, they all have a different grade of severity. Depending on circumstances, evidence, the jury etc, you can, for example, be found not guilty on the highest 2 levels of felony murder but guilty on the third and fourth, but in order to get there you need to be charged individually with all the different possible levels. So if the jury dismissed the highest count, they must decide on the next highest and so on until one is not guilty because that would automatically mean any charges below that must also be not guilty. But if you’re found guilty on the most severe count, you’re also guilty of the lesser charges, as these are less severe versions of the more severe crime.
because if people can profit off of incarceration there always be those who try to maximize said profit through unjust incarceration. if we let every single person in jail for weed out at the same time these private prisons stand to lose a lot of money.
Innocent until proven guilty is a legal standard that exists so that the government can’t throw people in jail based on an alleged crime. There’s no such mechanism in the social sphere. The public can have whatever reaction they want, and there’s no legal way to stop people from boycotting or having opinions
Because there are wealthy (or a lot of normal) people in the world willing to pay money for part of that animal. And there are many many poor people in the world willing to risk their lives/prison for the chance of making a lot of money. The only ways to stop poaching would be to eliminate poverty, giving everyone a good enough life that they would never risk that on killing a protected animal. This would be incredibly difficult, especially since there will always be people who just want More. Or to eliminate demand for the product, if you can convince all the people in the world to stop buying it, then there will be no reason to kill for it. Both of these are incredibly difficult challenging things to do. But until you can do both, poaching in some form will continue.
The idea is that these cost money. If the ID itself is free then time must be spent. The documents required may also cost money. Getting a copy of your birth certificate takes months in most places and does have some cost.  Personally I think the bigger issue is places that do not allow people to hand out water to people in line and also have very few voting sites. It can take hours to vote in some places because they limit voting sites.
Can you name another organization that would give an 18 year old a 50-100,000 dollar loan that can't be discharged in bankruptcy very easily? It doesn't make logical sense why we would give an 18 year old a loan that large with no prior history of credit. We don't even trust them enough to let them rent a car.
Decriminalisation - it’s not seen as ok by the police, but the police won’t arrest or prosecute you. Legalisation - it’s accepted as being ok and there is no legal reason against it.
In the US there is a doctrine called "inevitable discovery." If the prosecution can demonstrate that a piece of evidence would have eventually been found legally, a previously-inadmissible piece of evidence can become admissible. Here's an example from the case that established the doctrine at the Supreme Court, Nix v. Williams. Williams was an escaped mental patient who kidnapped and murdered a ten-year old in Iowa in 1968. He surrendered to police a few days later in another county. While being transported back, the detectives asked him to reveal where the body was, and he took them to it. He was later convicted, but the Supreme Court later ruled in 1977 that his right to council (sixth amendment) had been violated and reversed the conviction. At the retrial, the prosecution successfully argued that a search party was already looking in that area and would have found the body with or without Williams' cooperation, and Williams was convicted again. In 1984 the case reached the Supreme Court again and they upheld the decision.
First, under US law the government only gets a single try to prosecute a crime.  If they mess up, the guilty party walks.  This is an incentive for the government to take their time and build a very strong case before they go to trial.  Complicated cases take an especially long time to prepare for.   Second, in very large cases involving wealthy people or corporations, the defense may also delay the trial to get time to prepare, or just to stall the proceedings.   Third, courts tend to be very busy, and it can be difficult to schedule a trial right away, especially if the trial has to occur in a higher level court rather than a local one.
The guillotine is actually a quite modern and humane method of execution. It is quick and reliable. There were some reports from the executions during the French revolution indicating that the persons may have been alive after the executions but these have been debunked, although the myth is still propagated. The guillotine were in use up until 1977 when executions were abolished as a form of punishment in the countries using it. But it is still a method considered for executions even today. The issue with the guillotine is that it is quite bloody which can be quite grusome for the people watching as well as those who have to clean up afterwards. But for the executed it is one of the best way to do it. Other countries used the long drop hanging method which is also instant but does not pierce the skin and therefore is less grusome. The problem with the long drop is that it requires more experience by the executioner as if the length of rope or the weight is wrong then it can result in strangling or decapitation. And today only a handful of people in the world have performed the long drop and none of them can be considered to be experienced. Lethal injection is maybe the best way to perform executions although the process does take a lot longer then other method which can be considered as cruel in itself. Gas chambers is not as reliable and also does take a long time as well as dangerous for the executioners, it is very unpractical way of execution except for mass executions. Firing squads are a very practical easy way of execution by militaries as the tools are readily available. However it is quite unreliable and it is not uncommon for the executed to live for minutes after being shot, maybe only dying from a mercy shot to the head afterwards.
Had a psychology teacher explain it this way and it always stuck with me… /\   this is a **codependent** relationship. Each line represents one person. Each relies on the other for support and stability. If you take either person out, the other will fall.  |\   this is a **dependent** relationship. One person is a self sufficient individual (represented by the vertical line). They can stand on their own with or without the other person. The leaning line is dependent on the other person. If the vertical line is removed the dependent person will fall.  H  this is an **interdependent** relationship. Both people are individuals and can stand on their own without help from the other. If either line is removed, the other line continues to stand on its own. They are joined in the center to show there is mutual respect and support for each other, but are not dependent on the other person. Edit: formatting
There are really two main purposes: First, giving multiple life sentences emphasizes the severity of the crime. Second, and more importantly, giving multiple life sentences ensures that, if one of the convictions is successfully appealed and its sentence vacated, then there are still additional life sentences being served.
Getting one phone call is more of a TV/movie myth. In reality, it all depends on the severity of your charges, and how respectful you have been to your arresting officers. It could be anywhere between 0 and as many as you want, just remember all phone calls can be recorded, and any thing you say can still be used against you in court. You don't necessarily need to even call a lawyer. You can give them a name, name of a firm, or a phone number, or say you want to have an appointed lawyer (public defender) and they will call on your behalf.
They keep everything in storage until after the evildoers are convicted, it's evidence. After that; they spend the money, and destroy the drugs/guns.  Occasionally they recycle things in stings, but that's led to so many mistakes in the past that most departments just destroy it all.
Espionage used by government 'A' against government 'B' is totally fine under government 'A's laws. But if used by government 'B' against government 'A', that's not okay under government 'A's laws.   Simply put, it becomes against a governments laws when used *against* them, even if they use it against other countries.
Back in the day, mirrors were super expensive, like home theater/super car expensive.  For that reason alone you wanted to make sure that the servants were super-careful with them.  The other reason was that people really thought the mirror was a gateway to the next world.  Look at how many stories involve magic mirrors, or going through a mirror to 'the other side.'  Very expensive and powerful mystical object equals a lot of fear and superstition.
So the government knows to stop sending Social Security checks or telling you to show up for jury duty. Also, so your relatives can’t use your name to vote in elections.
Doctors and other professionals are typically paid by you (or indirectly by you through insurance). As such, there is a contract and legal obligation - there is an exchange of benefits. Breaching that legal agreement can be remedied by legal means. Certain professions (like doctors) also have professional promises that are legally enforceable.  There is no such legal contract with politicians. It is a double edged sword. We don't want politicians to engage in openly selling their elected authority (ie they represent their constituents). But that also means the only enforcement is at the voting booth.
When you deal with more organized criminal activity like cartels and terrorist organizations there’s always the risk that the sweep will miss a large portion of the organization.  If you only arrest *some* of the cartel’s upper-echelon of leadership, there’s a significant risk that the surviving members will try to identify the people involved and assassinate them or their associates. Since that’s always a risk, especially in less stable countries, the government enforcers often prefer to remain anonymous when conducting these operations.
Corporations and some other legal constructs are considered to have legal personhood. If a corporation did not have personhood you would not, for example, be able to sue one (or be sued by one). Contrary to popular belief this does not originate in Citizens United v. FEC, that case merely extended the concept of corporate personhood to include unrestricted political campaign contributions.
Usually it loops back to the same court.     It's not that uncommon, an order is issued, probably one of the most common things would be divorce courts. You tell 2 people this is the deal, then there's always some disputes, he was supposed to get the kid every 2nd weekend, but the mom keeps making exceptions or going out of town, or the guy was supposed to pay all school tuition but he didn't pay for the Football team fees and she thinks that's part of school costs etc...     So they actually bring it back to the courts to ensure compliance.    You'll find too many times a judge follows up on actions taken by the department of corrections, or on conditions of parole or whatever...     When it's a government thing, still kind of the same, like a number of times in the Trump era so far there's been a ruling, then non-compliance, then it's come back to that same court where they say 'No no, you can't redact that, and when I said All, I meant All' That happened a few times with different departments.    One of the best examples, Courts ordered the Department of Education could not collect on certain debts related to fraudulent schools, after the injunction, Betsy Devos had her department still try to collect those debts, so she was brought back to court and was held in contempt of court, they had to pay a $100,000 fine and were told if it happens again it's jail time.
Because it’s a federal country where states are somewhat independent from the federal government.  It’s the same in Germany where 16 states form a federal republic.
In Texas, there is still a high number of religious people and religious people believe life begins at conception. This is a fight that has been going on for decades because those of us who are not religious think life begins at birth. Personally, I think abortions should be limited to first trimester, before the fetus feels pain. I feel this is a decent compromise between the religious/science illiterate and the secular/intelligent people.  Greg Abbott is a garbage governor, more often than not ruling against the public. This is little more than a dog whistle in the hopes that his supporters will show up to back him next election.
You get multiple life sentences in case you beat one of them with appeals. If you do 3 crimes and get a life sentence for each, then you appeal and win the case so youre innocent on 1 of those 3 crimes, you still have 2 more life sentences to beat Its pretty much a way to make sure the person will not walk out of prison
So here's the thing about US Law.  You can sue anyone, for any reason, at anytime.  Our system is built to allow the courts to settle these matters.   As you note though, yes you need to have suffered some kind of damage to have the *standing* to bring a legitimate suit.  You can sue someone for anything but the court can throw it out if you lack the standing.  So on the surface, yeah I suspect that this law won't stand up because the people don't have standing to bring the suit. However, I am sure the argument will be made that they are bringing the suit in defense (well really vengeance) for the fetus which is not in a position to bring a suit.  This may still be a moot point since the fetus is not legally a person under the law and the court cannot possibly provide some sort of redress or payment to make this better. In the end though... Texas can pass any law it wants.  It's people voted for its State Legislature and as long as they don't violate the Constitution (which this law probably does but that's a different issue) they can do as they please.
Because Congress has passed legislation saying that he can be. There is no world government that decides what countries can and cannot do.
The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act was introduced in the House of Representatives in 1999. The law gives the US Executive Branch the power to identify big time drug dealers and impose sanctions on them, their businesses, and third parties that provide them with financial services. Those sanctions may include freezing assets held within an area over which the US has jurisdiction.  The first step toward building an international narcotics organization worthy of a kingpin designation is to stop getting high on your own supply. See, e.g., The Ten Crack Commandments, Christopher Wallace (1997).
Because prisoners outnumber guards and what else are you going to do, throw them into mega-prison? They're already in jail. And while the government can certainly "step in" it can only do so temporarily. It simply doesn't have the man power to keep an entire prison population under control indefinitely. Furthermore, prison gangs typically toe the line. They know that if they go too far the government will crack down, so they establish an equilibrium by only operating to the extent that a government crack down isn't seen as worth it or necessary.
No.  Most of the so-called "morality" laws are culturally specific.  What is "indecent" in some cultures is perfectly acceptable in others, or even in the same culture at different times.  I know for myself, a well-turned ankle poking out from beneath a lady's crinolines will reliably displace my codpiece.
What would be your plan to convince a jury that you actually found your friend's bloody shirt in the house that you broke into? When police gather and store evidence, there is a lot of meticulous tracking done to establish "chain of custody", which is how you prove where the evidence came from and how it was obtained. You would not be able to credibly establish that by playing Batman.
A huge portion of the harms caused by using a lot of drugs are directly related to the fact they’re illegal. Having the drugs be illegal to use ends up saddling a lot of people with criminal records that limit their access to education and employment - often perpetuating the conditions that led to a person taking the drugs to start with, and it drives the sales of the drugs to criminal organizations, dragging users into dealings with people committing other crimes. It also makes it more difficult for users to seek treatment for drug use, and limits treatment options. Decriminalizing drugs remove many of these harms, making it easier for those who want help to access it, and reducing the number of people who get formally marginalized by society due to criminal records who wind up taking drugs because their life has entered a new level of suckage. It also takes away some of the “glamor” of drug use, presenting it as an illness, where people are sick and getting treated in a clinical setting, rather than having it be some sort of edgy and rebellious thing teenagers do.
8% of federal inmates are in for violent crimes. \>50% of state inmates are in for violent crimes. There are some federal prisons that are full of people with no history of violence. Federal prisons are also regulated better and face national scrutiny instead of local
Why/How: Cosby was tried before, and the prosecutor declined to continue the trial based on insufficient evidence. This ended the suit. Prosecuting him again constitutes Double Jeopardy, which is a violation of due process.  If you've been tried for some thing in the past, you can't be tried for that same thing in the future. It sucks that errors in prosecution/evidence collection means wicked people go free, but it's good that police can't manufacture evidence to imprison innocent people. It's a real trade-off.
Emigration is going out, immigration is going in That's it If you used to live in the UK, but moved to Australia, then people in the UK will say you emigrated and people in Australia will say you immigrated
Both parties get paid for appearing on the show.  They sign a waiver / consent to binding arbitration, so the judgements issued on TV stand, but that isn't the whole picture.
Being a witness in a trial doesn't stop you from dying from natural or accidental death.  Did the witness have chronic health problems? Did they have a substance abuse problem? Did they like to drive fast? There are countless ways that a person can die that are either natural or accidental.
Quite a lot of games show you how molotov cocktails are made.  All you need is a bottle of flammable liquid and stuff a rag into it for a wick.  That's it.  They're not complicated.
Lawful permanent residents are required to carry their green cards at all times. No one does because if you lose it, you’re basically effed, but that what the letter of the law says . If you want to get employed, your employer must verify your right to work, for which you need to provide your ID, document proving your immigration status (visa/green card) and your SSN. To get a SSN, you must have an immigration status that allows you to work (and proof of it, like a visa or green card).
If you get out on bail you can wear you own clothes. If you are in jail you wear jail clothes. It's just another way our system favors money.
"Hours before closing arguments began on Monday, Judge Bruce Schroeder granted a defense motion to toss out the weapons charge. Rittenhouse attorneys Mark Richards and Corey Chirafisi pointed to an exception in the law that they said allows minors to possess shotguns and rifles as long as they’re not short-barreled." -https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/US/wireStory/explainer-judge-drop-rittenhouse-gun-charge-81285031 So he actually wasn't breaking the law.
Theoretically, you can sue because the law explicitly states that you can sue. Suing is about what the law says, not about what is fair. In practice, saying that the law is shaky is a big understatement, so chances are you won't get the $10,000 bounty for being a [concerned citizen trying to protect sanctity of the society from enemies of the people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Guards) It is, however, useful if you have nothing good to do with your life anyway since litigation costs themselves are a good way to clobber the peoples' enemies. As for HIPPA, it only affects medical providers. If you are not providing medical care or managing person's health information in professional capacity, it does not prevent you from talking about it.
The Constitution grants Congress the power “To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes”.  But under the original interpretation of this clause, they couldn’t restrict commerce inside of a single state.   This is why both the abolition of slavery and the prohibition of alcohol were done via constitutional amendment. Congress simply didn’t have the power to do so otherwise. This changed with *Wickard v. Filburn*. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn The basics of the case: >An Ohio farmer, Roscoe Filburn, was growing wheat to feed animals on his own farm. The US government had established limits on wheat production, based on the acreage owned by a farmer, to stabilize wheat prices and supplies. Filburn grew more than was permitted and so was ordered to pay a penalty. In response, he said that because his wheat was not sold, it could not be regulated as commerce, let alone "interstate" commerce The Supreme Court disagreed. >The Court decided that Filburn's wheat-growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for animal feed on the open market, which is traded nationally, is thus interstate, and is therefore within the scope of the Commerce Clause. Although Filburn's relatively small amount of production of more wheat than he was allotted would not affect interstate commerce itself, the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers like Filburn would become substantial. Therefore the Court decided that the federal government could regulate Filburn's production. This interpretation of the Commerce Clause granted Congress *way* more power to regulate the economy, since almost anything could be considered interstate commerce under the reasoning SCOTUS used in this case.  That reasoning is why Congress can, for example, criminalize the production and use of drugs like marijuana or heroin with legislation rather than requiring a constitutional amendment. *United States v. Lopez* somewhat curtailed this broad view of interstate commerce, but not much.  *Gonzales v. Raich* upheld the view of marijuana grown at home for personal use as being interstate commerce, for example.
You can serve time “concurrently” or “consecutively” for multiple convictions. Someone serving concurrent 2-year sentences for burglary and weapons possession should in theory be out of jail in two years.  Someone serving a consecutive sentence for the same thing would in theory be out in four years.  Now what people don’t know is that in some areas you get “credit” for every hour you don’t cause trouble in jail. So if you don’t cause trouble for an hour, you get credit for an additional hour of jail time.  So in the previous concurrent example the convict would be out in just one year and in the consecutive example he would be out in two years.  How the sentences are handed down is often dictated by state sentencing guidelines. The judge has a series of checks that determine the length of sentence and how it is to be served. If there is a prior criminal past that pushes the sentencing one way and if there is no history then it pushes it the other way. Things like employment, family in the community, job, home ownership, etc. can also play a role in sentencing.   For most serious crimes parole or early release is also possible if a percentage of the sentence has been served (I believe like 75-85%).   So after 8.5 years of a 10-year sentence someone could be eligible for early release.  In particularly heinous crimes, or frequent convictions, the sentences are designed to prevent early release by assigning more years to a sentence and making it a consecutive sentence rather than concurrent.   So a child rapist who accidentally kills their victim might only have gotten convicted for second degree murder, or maybe even just manslaughter.  Those would have significantly fewer years of potential punishment than first degree murder.  So for the rape the guy might only get 5-years and for manslaughter he’d get maybe 10-years. All total he could serve as little as just 5-years (remember he gets an hour of credit for every hour he serves with no trouble) and if the 5 and 10 year sentences are served concurrently then he would be out in no time.  By making the sentences consecutive he would serve as little as 7.5 years and as many as 15.  But a lot of it has to do with prior criminal history.
It's not a penalty. It's just a stoppage of play. Although the offending team is penalized somewhat by the ensuing faceoff moving to the offending team's side of the neutral zone.  An offside is when a member of the attacking team enters the offensive zone before the puck. The reason is it a rule is to prevent 'cherry picking'. 'Cherry picking' is when a player sits near the other team's net and waits for a pass even though the puck is at the other end of the ice. As long as the puck enters the offensive zone before any attacking players do, then the play is onside and play is allowed to continue.
I imagine that you are thinking of the recent Arbery trial. The accused did not face four counts of murder, but felony murder. Felony murder is when someone dies as a result of you doing something illegal. Different places define law differently, but that is the general gist of it. If you rob a bank, and someone dies as result, that is felony murder on your part, regardless if you did the actual killing yourself. In this case, there are four counts of felony murder because they committed four separate felonies, all which resulted in death. There were two charges of assault, one of kidnapping, and one of criminal attempt to commit a felony. Since Arbery died, each of those acts contributed to his death, and thus are each open to a felony murder charge. Not all of the accused were found guilty on all of them. For example, one of them was found not guilty on one of the assault charges, and thus also not guilty for the corresponding felony murder charge (but they were fond guilty of the other three felonies and other three felony murder charges). In addition to the felony murder charges, they also faced a single charge of murder, which accounts for killing that single person.
The judge presides over the courtroom proceedings and ensures that legal procedures are followed by both parties. The judge generally also decides the sentence once a guilty verdict is returned. Even though the jury decides guilt in criminal trials, the judge can in some circumstances overturn a jury's guilty verdict- though it's incredibly rare.
Not even remotely painless. I don’t really have a good answer for how it was adopted, but from descriptions of executions by electric chair, I don’t think anyone who witnessed one would be under the assumption that they are painless.
>Does the fact of me giving them credit omit me from plagiarizing? Yes.
It comes down to "jurisdiction". Each of the agencies you've listed has responsibility over a specific locality type of activity. Each is governed by a government body that presides over the same jurisdiction.  They are not in conflict very often because the laws they enforce are the same in spirit if not to the letter.  Example, if I murder someone in my city then my city police force will investigate and prosecute that crime. The State Police, Sheriff, and FBI have no jurisdiction under these specific circumstances and would be excluded unless invited by my city police to assist.
She was put under conservatorship in 2008 by the Los Angeles County superior court. The reason why was never officially made public, courts seal records related to medical issues including mental health. Rumors are that she suffers from bipolar disorder. To get out, she needs to convince the court that she's able to act as an adult, basically. While some of her statements on the matter were recently publicized, none of the expert opinions are public (e.g. from psychiatrists), and so there is really no way for anyone who is not involved in the court proceedings to figure out what is going on.
A picket line is the people you see standing outside buildings with placards etc during a strike.  The point of a strike is to cause some disruption or stop work happening. To cross the picket is to ignore or devalue the strike and enter the building, to do work or whatever.
Not sure, what "already broken" means in this context but I can't imagine a society that is less broken without rehabilitation. How would that be any better? EDIT: typo
In addition to when it is their jurisdiction there are times when the lower tiers of law enforcement are not equipped to handle or they are not capable of being impartial.
There are 2 ways to filibuster. First, they debate. Everyone gets a chance to argue for or against the issue. There is no clock, so technically you can talk forever and they can't vote until you are done. Obviously this is impractical and is usually more of a stall then a blockade. When debate seems over, they vote to end the debate and begin the voting stage. This takes 60 votes to pass in the senate. This is not the vote for the bill, it's the vote to start voting.  If 41 senators all agree to not vote to vote, then it never happens. This is the filibuster commonly talked about in the news. This process is not a constitutional requirement, and it could be amended if they wanted to.
The short answer is that the original framers of the Constitution did not believe they were necessary because the people could vote them out.  Congress was not a full time job way back then and and in fact they spent more time home in their districts back on the farm or whatever so they wouldn't know their people more closely and underneath from Congress.   Let's move forward to today. Over the years Congress has given themselves more and more power and the ability to gain incredible wealth once they leave.  The congressmen that are best at their jobs ,  that being their job is to retain their jobs,  know how to get things for their constituents so that they don't vote them out.  Finally, people in power never voluntarily give up their power. In order for term limits to be enacted Congress would have to vote to give up their own power.  You can take this to the bank, there will never ever ever be term limits for Congress.  It's never gonna happen.
Because imprisonment is enough. Why waste time, money and resources on bizarre and unusual punishments when you can just lock people up and forget about them where they can do no harm?  And, who says your system of morality is more valuable than someone else’s? If you start acting with evil intent to the evil, are you any better than them? Does you being evil to a serial killer undo their crimes?
It depends on the state.   California, for example, will sentence people to death, but the governor has to actually order the execution to be carried out and none have in 15 years.  So when you get sentenced to death in California you go to death row, but never actually get executed because the governor never orders that to happen. In other states its typically more of an issue of the types of appeals afforded to death penalty cases.  In a non-death penalty case you cannot typically introduce new evidence on appeal.  The only thing your appeal can concern is some error that occurred at trial.  You also only get one (1) appeal.  After that you can file something called a "habeas motion" but courts aren't obligated to hear those and most just shove them in a drawer and forget about them.  However, most states allow death penalty cases to appeal on the basis of new evidence. What this means is that if you claim to have any sort of new evidence that's relevant to your case, a court will stay your execution while it evaluates whatever it is that you've produced.  Getting a decision on that new evidence often takes a year or two, during which time you can't be executed.  The burden for what qualifies as new evidence is non-existent.  *Anything* that you purport to prove your innocence counts.   Someone who wasn't born at the time of the murder but now claims they saw someone else do it?  That's new evidence.  DNA evidence that shows a mere 99.99999% chance that you committed the crime?  There's a .00001% chance that the DNA came from someone else so that's new evidence that the court *has* to consider before you can be executed.  Once they've denied your appeal, you get to keep appealing so long as you can continue to produce new evidence. There are plenty of organizations that go out and actively find new witnesses or pay for additional evidence testing to stall out death penalty cases, so its often possible to stall out an execution until your right to appeal on the basis of new evidence is cut off.  *Typically* most states cut you off after either 5 or 10 years from the date of your conviction, so that's the point at which whatever administrative process is necessary to execute you begins moving foward.   Some states have shorter or longer cut offs, but typically when you see death row inmates dying of natural causes its because you're either in a California situation, where the death penalty exists in name only, or in a state that has a really long cut off for death row inmates being able to appeal their conviction on the basis of new evidence.
Police officers have full authority to arrest in their jurisdiction which is typically a town or county,  And state police obviously have jurisdiction throughout the entire state. Aside from ever having state jurisdiction, its essentially the same with the sheriff, except the sheriff is an elected position funded by said county rather than the entire state. A bailiff has jurisdiction within a courtroom. A corrections officer has no jurisdiction whatsoever outside of the corrections facility at which they are employed
As a general rule, defendants are allowed to change into proper attire when they attend court dates for the exact reasons you have mentioned - the jumpsuit is likely to be prejudicial to a jury. However, those clothes are not provided by the state.  If a defendant is unable to acquire suitable clothing, they will appear as they are.
Normally when you argue something or discuss something there is an implicit agreement that both of you are arguing for the sake of discussion or the exchanging of opinions and ideas; and that both of you are "playing fair" and not hiding your motives.  Arguing in bad faith generally means one of you isn't playing by the rules or are arguing for a dishonest purpose. If you're arguing something to humiliate the other person, that's bad faith. If you're arguing to stroke your ego, that's bad faith. If you're arguing to "win" some imaginary battle and aren't intending to give your opponent a fair shake, that's bad faith. If you intentionally misrepresent your evidence, lie, cheat, divert the discussion away from areas that you don't have the upper hand, that's bad faith. Questions asked in bad faith work in the same way. Generally one asks a question because they'd like to know the answer, or rhetorically they ask them as a way to highlight some point or argument and get those present to view the discussion in a different light. Asking questions in bad faith means asking a question when you don't care about the answer nor really are going to engage with it afterwards, you're just using it as a vehicle to "win" or otherwise use the answer to jump in to other bad faith argument tactics.
Because it was not entirely their fault in some cases depending on the mental illness. Like sometimes they literally just can’t understand what’s wrong with what they did.
There’s a few videos on YouTube that show the proper way to react when the police show up after a shooting. Definitely depends on the circumstances but ideally you don’t want to have your gun in hand when they respond to a shooting
The "Influence And Law Enforcement Under His Payroll" was local.  The people who prosecuted him were federal, and he had no influence there.  It took a lot to get the feds involved back then.
1st degree murder = at some point during the killing of a person, you have the thought, “I am going to kill this person.”  It doesn’t have to be before you attack them, but the thought has to occur to you.   This is called premeditation.  It means that you intend to kill them - you are trying to kill them.  It’s complete, evil, cold blooded murder. 2nd-degree murder = when you intentionally kill someone without premeditation.   So, you don’t actually have that thought, “I’m going to kill this person,” but you still shoot them in the face.    3rd-degree murder is when your actions guarantee the death of a person, but you did not necessarily intend death to occur.   You have to “act with a depraved mind and malice” Manslaughter is very similar to 3rd-degree murder, but the difference is the frame of mind of the person committing the crime.  That “depraved mind and malice” is not present here.  A person who commits manslaughter does commit an act that unintentionally guarantees the death of a person, but it is not with malice.  Drunk driving is a classic example of this. Negligent homicide is when someone causes a death through criminal negligence.  For example, failure to maintain a safe standard and maintenance on a ride at an amusement park, leading to ride failure, leading to deaths of patrons on the ride.
I don’t believe that Gaetz has been officially charged, nevermind sentenced. Until someone has been charged, they are not required to be imprisoned or in any sort of law enforcement custody. After being charged and before trial, a judge will determine whether the accused should be remanded to custody (imprisoned until trial) or allowed to post bail in order to maintain their physical freedom before the trial. Someone with few ties to the community and/or is a flight risk (has money/resources to easily flee) is more likely to be remanded. More serious crimes also tend to cause the accused to be remanded. Typically, between conviction and sentencing, the convict will be placed in prison. The sentencing hearing will take that time into account when passing sentence (eg. 3 months between conviction and sentencing means 3 months off their final sentence).
If i rip off your arm it's mutilation. If a doctor amputates your arm he's just doing his job. What is considered illegal often depends on the intent with which it is done and by whom. As well as wether something was done against ones will.
The United States of America is just that, a group of united states each of which has their own semi-independent government. As each of those governments are able to make their own laws it is possible, and therefore inevitable, that they will differ in some aspects. The age of consent is just one of those aspects. The age of consent isn't something that is arrived at factually, it isn't something we can measure like the strength of electrical charge of an electron. It is just a collective agreement on how old someone must be to be able to make sexual choices. Opinions will differ on this, and in fact it will likely vary between individuals.
an excuse is a dialectial tool used to attmpt to alter someone's perceived truth, usually in a manner that reduces the bad feelings said someone feels towards the user for something they did/say. as for when is it ok to use them, that's a moral issue so it is entirely subjective.  also this is not very eli5 i'm sorry
I worked as a public defender in law school one summer and the career criminals would ask if they could plead to the lowest felony instead of the highest misdemeanor. (Felony got you sent to state prison, misdemeanor was served at the county jail).  When I asked why they would willingly do more time, they told me that at the state prison, you got to smoke and watch tv, but at the county jail, you couldn’t.
Some choices are totally arbitrary. “Fire Department *of* New York” (FDNY) is just as grammatical and cogent as “New York Fire Department” (NYFD). They might as well have tossed a coin to pick one or the other.
Not an informed answer, but at the point where they’re arranging a murder, you can probably make an arrest for conspiracy to commit murder.
Welcome to the ugly grey area that's worked within to selectively punish people. You're NOT supposed to know the details, it's obfuscated on purpose. This is partly why corporations and rich people seem to shirk the law so well, they can afford to pay someone to tell them what side of the line to stand on that only violates the law in spirit, not letter
Sometimes the long prison sentences there to prove a point about how bad the crimes were. Often each crime carries its own sentence. If you do 10 crimes that carry the possibility of 25 years of prison each Then you could be sentenced to serving them all concurrently. That means that if one of them gets reduced or canceled on a technicality that you still have nine other crimes you're spending those 25 years doing but you're still out in 25 years. if they're done consecutively then each time you get it reduced a little bit you're still long beyond your lifetime.
You called it. So much time has passed, and so many guys have come and gone, that there’s no one left that cares about Sammy the bull.  The power structure of the mafia is so different now that everything Sammy and those kind of guys are talking about happened between 30 and 40 years ago, at the latest. Anyone that would have a beef with him is either already dead, or such a powerless old man that no one really cares anymore.
A guy named Michael Portillo investigated this.  He discovered one of the barriers to the adoption of painless execution (specifically nitrogen asphyxiation) is that there are people with influence who *want* people being executed to suffer.  [Here's the conclusion of the program.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9YgWXKAwNY) EDIT:  For what it's worth, there are actually some states that are [open to it as a possibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_gas_asphyxiation#Capital_punishment).

It’s not actually happening in the movies. It’s to bring context to the character or story.
Not every person being charged with a crime is guilty of that crime. A criminal defense lawyer isn't a lawyer that defends criminals it is a lawyer that defends people against criminal charges. This could be on the basis that the defendant is actually innocent, or was justified in committing the crime (self defense, extenuating circumstances, etc) or cannot be held criminally liable due to insanity or some other reason.
It's not that warning shots are per se illegal in the United States. It's that they are usually judged by the same standards as shots targeted at another person. In other words, if deadly force is not justified, don't fire a warning shot. There are reasons warning shots are judged by such a strict standard. First, who is to say a warning shot isn't just a targeted shot that missed? Second, the very fact that you fire a shot puts the person you are warning in fear or his or her life, for good reason. Indeed, that's the intent of the warning shot. So it's still an assault, even if it's not a fatal one. Third, firing your gun is reckless if deadly force is not justified, even if you aim it straight in the air. People can still get hurt by stray bullets, or they can get hurt because they fear for their lives.
Because lie detectors are unreliable pseudo-science, to the point that even the inventor regrets it's invention.
Jurors generally cannot ask a question directly, but some judges allow jurors to write down a question, which is passed to the judge who determines (sometimes with the attorneys) if it is appropriate to ask and they'll ask it.     Part of this is tradition and part of this is to remove jury bias. If the jury can effectively guide the case, that creates all sorts of problems. There's some arguments that allowing the jury to directly cross examine creates problems with the 5th amendment.
I am of the suspicion that in the US these textbooks are sold with higher prices because the book sellers abuse the system in which students take out exorbitant loans. The same books I find here in Europe would sometimes be worth like 6 times more in the US. I have a feeling it's because students take out so much in loans already they can charge more because they reason the bank is paying for them.
People who have done the required work to lawfully get a permit to carry a concealed weapon are not likely the problem. People who haven't are breaking the law and probably many others as well.
If you own an item, you can decide to let others use it (and under which conditions), or give it away for free, or not at all. "All rights reserved" means "not giving it away in any form", but for intellectual property instead of physical one. "Some rights reserved" (e.g. CC licenses) or "public domain" (i.e. giving it away for free and unconditionally) also exist.
It isn't illegal. Casinos just have the right to refuse to gamble with people so long as it's not class based discrimination so if they suspect someone is doing so they have the right to ask them to leave.
The act of disposing of a weapon can be an attempt to distance oneself from a crime.  If the police see that someone was killed with a specific type of handgun, and then through their investigation, they discover that you have that handgun in your possession, it's a huge help towards solving the crime and prosecuting the criminal.  Disposing of the weapon could provide a means of deniability if the weapon is found, for example a criminal may say "Oh someone stole that gun from me a month ago and I haven't seen it since."  Plausible defense if the gun is found in a lakebed, not so much if it's found in your sock drawer.
Because then they just wouldn't ever give any information at all. Read any deposition and see the amount of "I cannot recall" and "Not to my knowledge" that is involved to avoid perjury; a press conference that consisted mostly of that would be useless to everyone. Perjury is a very serious crime that people will go out of their way to avoid, so putting people under oath results in them sharing less information for fear of accidentally saying something that isn't completely true, which in turn defeats the purpose of a press conference, which is to get as much information out of the spokesperson or politician as possible in a limited time
The scammers don't usually live here. It's hard to find them, and when we do our police (the FBI) have to work within their own country's laws to arrest them and bring them back here for prosecution. This is very difficult and very expensive. The scammers know that some of them will get caught, and that from those who get caught, some will be arrested and put in jail, but they also know that most of them will get away with it.
>Sometimes burglars don’t leave behind fingerprints, but that doesn’t mean they’re innocent. Yes. But this isn't the case we're talking about. We're talking about the case where a burglar **did** leave fingerprints and someone else is accused of said burglary. Do you understand how leaving fingerprints, in this case, would absolve the wrongfully accused person?  It would be the same with DNA evidence in rape cases.
Fighting is tolerated but still penalized in the NHL and minor leagues in North America. The NHL has stricter penalties for using a makeshift weapon like a stick or skate that could cause serious injury. Fighting is rare in college hockey, European hockey, or Olympic hockey because it’s much more strictly penalized. The refs in the NHL break up a fight when one player has gained a significant advantage over the other. Thus if one player is down or in a headlock or otherwise vulnerable they will break it up. So you may see two enforcers in the NHL agree to fight, square off as the refs watch, and exchange punches (often while holding each other’s sweaters since boxing on skates isn’t easy). But when one player falls or gets trapped in a headlock the fight is over.
I imagine it’s harder to definitively prove the person was texting while driving while the other gets a breathalyzer or blood drawn.
"Pleading Insanity" is not something done lightly like pop culture often makes it out to be. You'd go though an intense psychological evaluation, and if they found you to be insane enough so that you can't understand right from wrong, you get committed with no set timeframe of release, just when they decide you're "cured." So instead of spending maybe a couple years in a minimum security facility, you're likely to spend a decade or more in an institution, probably constantly drugged up and "treated." Not a good trade-off.
There are many ways, but some involve comparing medical records to the evidence that's left. Say you've got s largely decomposed body. Bone structure says late twenties, early thirties female. Decomposition is largely complete, so not fresh. How have things around it (plants, etc) grown, as they can indicate when the body was left (full of roots, etc). So now look at known missing persons that fit that sex, age, and timeline. Check their medical records for known damage. Broken bones, dental fillings, etc. If they match, likely that person.
Some life sentences are strictly until the day you die (i.e. life without the possibility of parole). Life with the possibility of parole means that, unless someone decides you can go, you will die in prison so it is a provisional life sentence Edit: in some countries, life is a started term like 18 years and not actually life. In the Netherlands this is the case, but they do have a full life sentence for people who can't be reintegrated
So, 25 to 52 years means he is must serve 25 years before he is allowed for parole.  He is up for parole every X amount of years until it's granted or until he serves 52 years in total.
something that is legal is documented in the law and has no specific law banning it.  Like theres no law telling you you´re not allowed drinking coca cola.  Decrimialied means there is or was a law declaring it illegal but no punishment is stated or required,  Like many states and regions state that the consumption of drugs is illegal but states no punishment for their use, In portugal for example, drugs are illegal but use and posession in personal use amounts is decriminalized meaning you wont be punished if you are caught having or using drugs.
We lock proficiencies and talents up in this very high box in the sky. We act like it takes A LOT to learn how to do particular jobs, art, sports etc... Generally humans are pretty good at looking around and imitating, so even if you don't "get it" you can still fit in and perform relatively alright.  Some often feel like they're an imposter when they become proficient at something with much more ease than they originally anticipated. They convince themselves that instead of understanding something on a base level enough to perform, that they must be faking it and are at risk of being "exposed" It typically goes away once your confidence matches or exceeds your proficiency at whatever task one feels an imposter to.
You can record a crime, absolutely. Like, you can record a murder and you won't get in trouble for recording the murder. But you cannot in a two party consent area record the speech (or possibly Identity) of somebody without them knowing it. In certain states there are single consent states which basically means that as long as one party is aware of the recording happening they're allowed to record the words of the other (I believe Texas is one of these). I think the general idea of it was to allow interrogation rooms to record "innocent until proven guilty" individuals without telling them they're being recorded, but this can be used other places as well.
It's mostly that it's still being stuff uncovered and german laws don't have some "forgiven period" for crimes like murder. Only little fish being caught now as historians go through 80 year old files and occasionally find someone new who wasn't punished yet. The justice system is simply not allowed to let it slide no matter how unlikely an execution of the sentence is (Similar to how Niels Högel (the "death nurse") is on trial for  another 100 of his 500+ murders after being already sentenced for 6 and pretty much never getting out of prison anyways) And random correction that just being a member of the Nazi party isn't considered a crime. Many joined it because otherwise their career would have ended. But being in the SS is a different story.
Teacher here, not from the US as well, some reasons from the top of my head: 1. Being excluded from your community, aka class does very much to a human being. 2. The pupil is inhibited from disrupting class and learning even more.  3. The parents learn about the bad behaviour and will punish their kid for that as well.  4. It also has schoon law reasons: at my school you need to be suspended 5 times before worse consequences can follow. So a supension works like a warning.
On top of what others have said, it's possible you hear about more of them because of the way Florida's public criminal records system works. The same reason we have r/FloridaMan
The origin is the Matrix movies. Basically Neo is given a choice between taking the blue pill and waking up in the safe, comfortable reality that he believes is truth but actually just a fantasy, or, he can take the red pill and see what reality truly is hidden behind the lies he’s been told his whole life. In the movie Neo takes the red pill which allows him to be located and wake up so he can be unplugged from the great deception and have his eyes opened to the truth.
>“To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.” It's one whole phrase. The second chunk: >and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof. refers to any additional powers that are given to Congress/the Federal Government that were not explicitly enumerated above. This allows Congress to make new laws for new executive departments, without needing an amendment to the constitution to establish that new department and explicitly empower it.
You can't usually force someone to give up something that they own.  So if Stan Lee's family actually own the rights to the Marvel characters that Stan Lee created, then Disney needs to come to an agreement with the family to buy the characters from them.  The value of those characters is unlikely to be "small". As to why they're suing - Stan Lee's family took legal action that is designed to put the world on notice that the family owns the characters in question and that Disney is not using them with the family's permission.  That has implications for Disney in any future lawsuit in which the family claims that Disney is infringing on the family's copyrights.   It also might make other companies concerned about working with Disney on any Marvel works.  If Disney is, in fact, infringing on the family's copyrights then you, as an unrelated company doing business with Disney, are no longer an innocent bystander in all of this but, rather, an active copyright infringer who can also be sued. Although Disney filed a lawsuit they're not asking for money.  They're asking a court to review the situation and confirm that they are, in fact, the legal owners of the Marvel copyrights in question.  This provides certainty to everyone involved.  For Disney, it prevents them from being sued 20 years from now and then owing money for every Marvel movie they've made in between.  For other companies working with Disney, it gives them the piece of mind of knowing that Disney is, in fact, the legal owner of these copyrights and that they, as an unrelated third party, don't have to worry about being dragged into this.
Because we round down at 0.  0,1,2,3,4 round down and 5,6,7,8,9 round up.  Generally, 0-9 are considered together, 10-19, 20-29, and so on.  In your example 10 isn't being rounded up. It's being rounded down from the group of 10-19.
Its because the American criminal justice system is a financial racket. I'm not a lawyer so I can't give you a real answer but as an outside observer and one time participant, that's my best answer for it. There's a reason people say "freedom isn't free".  And that's because you don't have to deal with the consequences of your actions if you can pay for it.
Well I'm gonna get downvoted all to hell but here we go. During the Kenosha riots there were a lot of people who, based on your political outlook, could be described as vigilantes or heroes or terrorists or whatever that took it upon themselves to try and protect businesses from the rampant arson and destruction of property. Kyle Rittenhouse was one of those people. Over the course of the night Rittenhouse shot 3 people, killing 2 of them. For that he was charged with 2 counts of murder and 1 count of, I believe, attempted murder. Over the course of his trial it has become abundantly clear that the prosecution's case for those charges was flimsy at best. The political left tends to call him a terrorist or a murderer. The political right ranges from calling him hero to just a guy defending himself.  I personally believe he acted in self defense when he shot those people, but I also feel that he made some bad decisions that placed him in that situation. I could see manslaughter, but not murder.
You'd normally expect the shot in the shoulder guy to be a star witness but that guy was as sharp as a bag full of wet mice and never gonna help.   It's not all as bad as that, still there's so much evidence of self defence it's an uphill battle. Edit. Don't know about that judge, reserving judgement for a little longer.
Federal trials are not typically made into cheap television crap drama like state and local trials are. So, no cameras in a courtroom where serious business is being done.
Back in 2008, she was hospitalized at UCLA medical center and placed on a 5150 hold, or psychiatric hold. During this time she was in a custody battle with her ex-husband Kevin Federline.  A few weeks later, she was back at the hospital on a 5150 hold. A day (feb 1st)after her second hospital visit, her father had the LA county Supreme Court make himself the conservator of her person. The father and his lawyer are placed in charge of the estate.  On July 31st, the Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Reva Goetz extended conservatorship till end of the year. But, October 28th, the same judge had it extended indefinitely. Due to the complexity of her brand, finances, and her ability to be influenced.  In 2012, her then fiancé is made conservator of her person, but not finances or career.  From 2012-2021, had been set real court cases where various lawyers and people argue that Brittany cannot handle/manage her own affairs. Her lawyer referred to her as “comatose person” in 2020. Later I. 2020 it’s revealed brittany’s lawyers could have filed a petition to end the conservatorship but it would mean a psych-eval which seemed to have been a deal breaker.  This year has mostly been a battle of replacing her father in the conservatorship and finally winning the right to choose her own lawyer (she was unable to fire them and had the same lawyer for 13 years.  TLDR: Either she really needed the conservatorship for a time, or like 6-7 individuals (Jamie, judge Goetz, Ingram (brittany’s lawyer), brittany’s fiancé to name a few) Did some conspiracy level manipulating of the system for various reasons. Billboard has a decent timeline of events https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/9445409/britney-spears-conservatorship-timeline/
An extradition treaty is a formalized agreement (usually for both sides) to extradite people who are wanted in the other country for certain types of crimes. Either country can always decide to extradite, but they may have to justify it internally (does the legal code allow them to arrest someone who has not broken any local laws?). The extradition treaty just gets the legal work done ahead of time (eg, explicitly allows the police to arrest someone who has not broken any local laws, but has broken any of the laws listed in the extradition treaty while in the other country).
There's no boundary because banning misinformation is fully contained within the definition of "censorship". Censorship is a restriction of available information and can be done for a variety of reasons by a variety of actors in a variety of situations, not all of which are "bad".  The rest of your post is asking for subjective/speculative answers and ELI5 isn't for those.
She had a very public meltdown about 10-12 years ago, and as a result it was determined that she wasn't capable of handling her own affairs like a responsible adult.  The court named her father and someone else as conservators of her estates meaning they have power to manage her finances and make important decisions on her behalf. Now that she's nominally in a better headspace, she's facing a Kafka-esque nightmare where she has to prove she's capable of controlling her own affairs to the same institution that previously determined she was incapable of doing so.
This is why common core math was adopted in recent years, because issues like this are excessively common. Previously memorization was the main mechanic, instead of conceptualization of numbers. If you didn't have it memorized you had no tools to fall back on. Now students are taught to visualize and decompose numbers to make operations like these easy to do mentally. This can be fixed, but it will take a little training and effort. Fortunately that's not super difficult for an adult to achieve in a few weeks (assuming there's no learning disability). You just have to practice things like decomposing numbers into 10s. Eg your example 77+79 could be 70+70+7+9. 70+70 is 140. 7+9 is 16. 140+16 is now a pretty easy operation. Decomposition of numbers into groups is a very useful skill for doing mental math.
People need Food, Clothing and Shelter to survive.  Abandoned cities lack one of these basic necessities, in the form of Food.  Just having a house to sleep in does nothing for someone who has no access to food and water.  Sure they have a house to sleep in, and may be able to stay warm depending on the location. But all of the infrastructure needed to survive, water and sewage, electricity, medical care, EMTs such as Fire and Rescue etc... are all missing. With these cities abandoned there is nobody there to do these things, they wouldn't be abandoned otherwise. The homeless might as well be living out in the wilderness if they are just going to stay in a abandoned city.
Back when the gold standard was common, whenever there was a bad thing that suddenly needed a lot of money like a war, countries would spend their gold, and when they ran out, they would go off the gold standard.   When things settled down, they would go back on the gold standard.      Then World War 1 and 2 happened, the USA was out for the start of both of them, so they got everyone's gold. But things got so bad that nobody could go back on the gold standard, so they agreed to use US dollars instead of gold (since the US had all their gold anyway).      Now France didn't like the US having so much say in their economy, and tried to exchange back some of their US dollars for gold with the US government.   But the US didn't want to do that, so they went off the gold standard.      They thought it was temporary, but going off the gold standard let them do a lot of things with their economy, like controlling the money supply when the economy went bad or was overheating.      So they never went back on.
Because India isn’t as heavily industrialized. Most Indians still work in agriculture, growing the food they need to survive and some extra to sell, something that is important, but doesn’t produce much wealth. While those smaller more industrialized countries have people that are creating much more valuable items, leading to a higher GDP.
Yes its better for the ultra wealthy to spend decent chunks of their wealth instead of hoarding it. During the R&D phase of the rocket development, this was likely a decent enough stimulator of the economy.  However: 1. He could comfortably support numerous "worthy" causes. Arguably many billionaires created their wealth through the exploitation of the average person, so many people think they have a duty to give back to society (I'm not going to get into a moral debate here). 2. Now the rocket has been developed, is it just going to be a cycle of space tourism where the ultra wealthy pay other ultra wealthy for a frivolous and very polluting activity with no flow of wealth through the greater economy.
Apple cash: slipping your best friend $25 bucks for some weed. Apple pay: using your credit card at 7/11 to buy food after you've used up all the weed. Apple wallet: keeping your medical records available for the ER doc for when you fell down after leaving 7/11 and split your lip in two.
Liquidity is how quickly an asset you possess can be turned into cash for immediate use. Cash is obviously the most liquid since you can transfer and spend funds in a bank account immediately.  Stocks are considered good liquidity because you can sell stocks and have the cash in your account in 3 days.  What about your house? It isn’t very liquid since you have to put it on the market snd that can take a while. So if you need money quickly, this won’t help you…assuming you want full value of it and not giving it at a discount.  Liquidate is to completely turn an asset into cash.  You own 10 shares of a company? You sell 10 shares? You’ve liquidated. Sell a car? You liquidated your car.  You sell the house? Liquidated that asset as you no longer have it, and instead have cash. Also, how liquid something is relative to how quickly you need the cash. Let’s say you own a Rolex worth 15k. You could try and sell it for 15k but that will take some time. If you’re in a hurry you could sell it for 100 dollars and someone will buy it instantly. Selling the house for a million? Takes time. Sell for 100,000..quick but not full market value.
The package is probably transfered between different trucks at least twice, and might even get on an airplane, train or ship for part of its journey. When you get a notification they have probably just printed the shipping label and calculated a route for your package using the existing scheduled services. Typically you would have trucks doing pickups in the afternoon collecting all the packages from an area and driving them to the closest distribution center. There it would get transfered to another truck where it is driven all night to a distribution center near you. And then the next morning a truck distributes the packages to everyone in your area. They do this every day with the same schedule.
The pandemic caused reduced demand, so they produced less. As the demand went up, the production didn't catch up so the price is up now. Supply and demand was the first part. The additional cost added on top of this was the transport issue. There were less truck drivers to deliver the stuff as well.
The currency is eventually replaced.  A new currency with more reasonable denominations is issued and the old currency becomes worthless after a set trade-in period. Venezuela has done this once, and is preparing to do it again. This “fixes” the logistical issues with gigantic currency denominations, but the underlying inflationary problems don’t go away until government policy changes. Some nations have ended up abandoning their currency sovereignty entirely and using USD or Euros to make it impossible for political malfeasance to cause hyperinflation again - although this brings its own problems too.
It depends on the item and if there is tracking stuff in place. If you're at a big retailer, like say a grocery store chain, a major bookstore, or such, yup, everything is generally recorded and periodically sent back to the vendor or to companies like Nielsen or IRI who are in the business of tracking sales metrics. Smaller retailers... its gonna be more of a hit and miss if they report actual sales. For some items, a company may marked it as "sold" when its shipped to a retailer. They may not care if the retailer actually sells it or not, thats not their problem, their customer is the retailer, not the end user. This is very common. Often you may see this as units "shipped" or units "sold" Books are a bit wacky in that there are multiple ways to count book sales, all of which are right, but will all give you very different numbers at the end of the day, so we should avoid the specific book example as that one is just a bad and confusing situation.
An option is an option contract = 100 shares, you DECIDE a date (Fridays) at what price (higher price) you have the right to buy 100 shares. You pay the price (premium) for 100 shares. You bought a call option one week ago.  0.60$ strike price 3$ at 26.10.21 would mean a stock was let's say worth 1$ one week ago. you pay 60$ and the stock rises to 5$, you basically have 500$ worth if stock minus the 60$ premium  you paid = 440$ gain,  minus the price of the stock (300$) to buy it at the strike price.  so140$  gain.  You can exercise (buy the stock for 1$, so 100$ and sell for 500$) or sell the Contract before the date, which rises in value close to the exercise price. Most sell options and don't exercise. Basically today I wanna buy your Apple worth 1$ today for the price of 2$, because I think it will be worth 10$ (demand, news, hype, merger, split, meme) I pay you 20 cents to buy it tomorrow. You think wowo i earn 20% and tomorrow it won't be worth even a Dollar. Tines 100. If it's worth 10$ tomorrow, you pay 2$ plus the 20 cents you already paid. You profit. Think of it like a stock, which just is too expensive, but you really think it will rise. You only pay a tiny fraction. Maaaayve then you have money to exercise, or just profit huge.
For the same reason anything is worth money - because someone is willing to pay for it.  That also means that NFTs are only worth what someone is willing to pay for them which can range from *nothing because they are kind of a stupid idea* to *omg I'll give you my house this is going to the moon*.
Because every dollar youve saved became worth half as much. Also prices will double faster than the total supply doubling.
A consumer is generally accepting of having costs passed onto them when it's something like fuel and transportation costs.  But when costs go back down, I don't think consumers are as aware of when that happens.   A wholesaler will be happy to have an increased profit margin for a time without consumers noticing.  The only way prices drop after costs go down is for competitors to lower prices.   The minute one company drops prices, the rest will drop to compete.  If prices don't drop, that's a sort of cartel-ish behavior where everyone chooses to fix their prices.
Banks aren't lending their own money, they're lending their customers' money and just pocketing the interest.
Besides selling, you can make money through dividends. That's when the company gives the shareholders a split of the profits.
7b yearly in logistics, we already produce enough food goods in the us alone i beleive, but most gets thrown out. The issue is logistics. Getting food to those places and packaging. But we do know the approximate cost of those.
Tesla's worth so much because people want to buy shares of the company. Strictly, the stock price doesn't reflect the company's capital assets or revenue -- the market capitalization is based on perceived future value. Why do people think Tesla has so much potential? It depends on the investors, but they generally note that Tesla is investing strongly, growing rapidly, the demand for their products and services is stronger (demand outstrips supply), and the company is not only manufacturing electric cars, but a whole electricity and electricity-storage infrastructure that includes battery technologies and supply chains, energy storage, and renewable energy production. Tesla is a potentially disruptive and market-defining integrated multi-industry company. It's not just rapidly growing, but has rather obvious massive future growth potential. In fact, it really doesn't have a serious competitor for the type of company it's shaping up to be. If you look at Tesla as just an electric car company, the price is not justifiable. However, if you take a broader view, it's still probably over-priced but it's at least justifiable.
A lethal combination of endemic system-wide corruption and the inability of the USSR to keep up with the US in regards to military spending.   The USSR tried to fix their economic issues with some economic reforms that leaned toward capitalism and they included some relaxation on the rules regarding elections and political parties.  These changes led to their border regions pushing away and the eventual dissolution of the USSR but not before a last minute attempt to stop it by the hardline Communists via a military coup.  It failed.
APR stands for annual percentage rate so there is a time component. I hope that helps. It can get a bit more complex too.
It is a government agency that regulates the securities market. This covers the stock market. Any company that sells shares in the USA must abide by laws made by Congress and enforced through the SEC.
MLM is actually a very simple model because everything is delegated to the independent sellers. All you have to do is con people into the MLM and get them to buy your sales package. After that, you don’t care if the product actually gets sold to a customer, you already have your money.
It \*can\*. It's just not a very good idea. Although there's a philosophical argument that, if you have completely open borders, do you really have a functional country, since the boundary becomes essentially invisible to everyone? Completely open borders means total loss of border security, trade policy, immigration, and several other things that governments (and citizens) have legitimate concerns about. Completely open borders means you don't even have the \*option\* to control those things.
No. If you grow crops or chop trees or mine minerals, you're "producing" wealth and adding it to the economy. That wealth was not present before, and you didn't take the potatoes/wood/iron ore from someone else, so no one was poorer for your gain.
Side payments. Say you are doing business internationally from China. A buyer wants to buy $10,000 worth of goods. You tell the buyer, place the official PO for $9,000 and another side payment of $1000 to an offshore bank account. So $9,000 is officially remitted back to China while $1,000 is now offshore.  Another method is to use transfer pricing (not only applies to China). Ask the buyer to place a $10,000 order with an offshore subsidiary. The subsidiary charges $1,000 as a profit/fee/commission and remits $9,000 to the head office in China. This $1,000 is now in the subsidiary account offshore. Of course the subsidiary justifies this $1,000 as legitimate local expenses (local salaries, rent, operating expenses etc).
Countries debt isn't like a loan shark or a credit card.  It's not something where the whole balance and due and the interest rate is killing you if you don't pay it off.  It's much more like having a mortgage.  It's long term low interest debt.  It's pretty trivial for people to get a home loan well in excess of their annual income.  This is especially true for high earning individuals.  The US has a great "credit score", since they have always repaid their debts, as such they can float a very large amount of money at low interest, and it's not particularly scary to investors in part exactly due to the strong economy the US has.
Someone owns a stock. You ask to borrow that stock, for a fee. You immediately sell that stock at market price. Wait until you think the price has bottomed out.  Buy back the stock. Give back the stock to your lender. Pocket the difference.
Its just a fancy way of saying the accounting books need to be open and accessible to the public so that people can see exactly what the funds were spent on. That way people can review them in their free time and examine how much money is spent on what.  Its a similar concept to open source software. The source code is open to the public for review and editing. This is supposed to create better software as more people can view the code to optimize, eliminate bugs, and ensure it is only doing what it says it is doing. In this case the public wouldn't be able to edit the accounts, but they could track all the expenses.
Because of the baby boomers The old population at some point is going to be bigger than the young population, and because there won't be enough young people paying in, social security will run out and old people who did not plan for retirement will not have social security This is an even bigger problem in china, because of the one child rule, the old population is getting huge compared to the young. No matter what system they have it is overloaded and there is not infrastructure to take into account that situation (hospitals, old homes etc) Same here, we simply do not have the needed things to support a large old and unworking population
Depends on a lot of factors you've not included -- the country where you live, who gave you the money, etc.
Its not so much too much money in the market. Crashes happen when there’s not enough lending going on. When financial institutions stop lending (either because they’re not getting enough money themselves or because they’re afraid to lend to people or companies in certain industries) then businesses have a difficult time expanding and growing so they cut back as well. Then that leads to job and wage cuts. That also leads to decreased stock values. I’m not sure if prices for everything tend to go up. But prices for certain goods normally do, and the increased prices for staple goods normally hurt the most because they’re things people regularly need but have a harder time paying for (gas, food, etc.). Some industries get hit harder than others like tourism and recreation because people don’t have extra money to spend to do things aside from the necessities to keep their household afloat. But other sectors have sinking prices like cars and homes because the market is either flooded or stagnated with excess as less people buy them which also sinks values for companies and for assets like houses that people may have investments in. And all of this kind of snowballs into a huge financial mess.
>An example: I'm a medical assistant. Let's say the average hourly pay, nationwide, is $16. But some companies are willing to hire their medical assistants at $20-$22. When I tell an employer during an interview that I've been offered a higher pay elsewhere, they will still low-ball me at $16. Why can't that employer be more competitive with those higher paying companies? Does it come down to stinginess or is there some sort of economics involved?      Any rational employer will always pay the lowest possible wage for the best possible employee. Anybody who thinks that they have a high likelihood of succeeding with low-ball offers will make them. Just like you may have offers from different employers, employers may have other applicants for your desired position.
Can't give you a good answer on how much a banana will be in eighty years, but in general inflation is supposed to continue, yes. Many treasure departments or reserves or central banks around the world have a key responsibility to manage inflation at a low but sustainable rate - the idea is that this encourages employers to keep hiring new employees, encourages individuals to keep investing and purchasing, etc. Deflation sounds great but it is often thought to be a sign of a *shrinking* economy, where people are not spending as much as they are just saving which weakens companies and the markets.
It's not about whether or not they benefit society. It's about how they benefit themselves. Publicly traded companies are publicly traded because they wanted to get some cash to expand their operations at one point. That does mean that a regular person can buy in to such a company and make some money from it if they want.
>When you sell stocks/shares, who/what do you sell them to and where does the money come from?      You sell them to someone else who - just like you did at some point - wants to buy them. They pay you.   When you bought the share you paid someone money in exchange for it. When you sell it you get money in exchange for transferring the share to someone else.
If you believe all that it specifies to be true is true then exactly the same way as any other country.
Because I can hire you for a specific job for an agreed upon price and duration, and have no further obligations to you after the job is over- or if I decide to fire you. You come with your own insurance, your own management, your own equipment (generally), and your own pay system. You exist completely separate from my business. Hiring employees is a lot more complex, and usually takes much longer and costs more. For specific jobs that you aren't going to do regularly, contractors are the way to go.
From the dictionary: " A form of investment (illegal in the US and elsewhere) in which each paying participant recruits two further participants, with returns being given to early participants using money contributed by later ones." So you pay someone a dollar above you and you get multiple people below you to pay you a dollar.  Generally a portion of the dollars paid to you is given to the person above you as well. A few people at the top get rich, while the people near or at the bottom pay, but never get their dollar back.
They tried that for many years. It didn’t work. The paywall model comes closer to turning a profit for the newspapers. As an added point, if the articles were free, there’d be even less reason to subscribe for the physical papers.
Loans obtained without the intent to ever pay them back are considered fraudulent.  You can't, for example, run up a massive debt with the intent of then immediately declaring bankruptcy.  Also, it's rare for people to receive large lines of unsecured credit.  It's easy to get a line of credit if you have property for example, that that debt is secured by the property, so giving away the money just means losing the property.  Also, while debts can't be passed on, debtors do have first rights to the deceased estate.  So if you had anything you planned to pass on to your children, it would first get sold to pay off your debts before you could pass any of it down.
Don't forget to factor in the (usually) higher taxes on short-term capital gains if you are actually going to get into day trading.
The formulas used by automated market makers (AMMs) vary but they all have one thing in common: to provide the liquidity that the markets use to make assets available to buy, liquidity providers give some of each asset in the trading pair to a liquidity pool. **But as soon as someone buys either asset, the liquidity provider has less of it.** (That is, the liquidity provider's claim to what's left in the pool is reduced on the side of what the buyer bought, while their claim to what's left on the other side is increased.) At first glance it may seem that the total value should remain the same, but it doesn't.  As an exaggerated example, let's say the trading pair is BERT and ERNIE, and at the moment you create the BERT-ERNIE liquidity pool, both BERT and ERNIE are valued in other markets at $5 each. Let's say you put 10 BERT and 10 ERNIE in the pool. You contributed $50 + $50 = $100 of value to the pool.  Then I buy 1 ERNIE from the pool, paying 1 BERT for it. Now the pool has 9 ERNIE and 11 BERT. If you were to withdraw your liquidity now, would the 9 ERNIE and 11 BERT you'd receive be worth as much as the 10 ERNIE and 10 BERT you deposited? Clearly the market has more demand for ERNIE than it does for BERT (as evidenced by the trade), so maybe ERNIE is now worth $5.50 while BERT is now worth $4.50. The pool, and your claim to it, is worth 9×$5.50 + 11×$4.50, or $99. Your impermanent loss (or divergence loss) is $1. People call it "impermanent loss" because the lost value can come back if sentiment for that trading pair swings the other way. But there's no guarantee that it will, so "impermanent loss" can be misleading.  For more discussion, ask in r/defi.
Agents are useful because they handle all the negotiations and all the work so that the boss doesn't have to. The agent could be the tough person saying no or negotiating for more money while leaving the celebrity out of all of that
Answer: it means pay that is in the same ballpark as pay for similar jobs/companies.  For instance if a normal pay is $15/hour for a restaurant job and your restaurant is offering $9/hour, your pay is considered uncompetitive.
> how could the broker possibly know the company everyone worked for in order to properly process the trades? They don't. When trades are made, both sides record the order information and submit it to the clearing house, who matches all submitted trades together. This is why to this day trades don't settle immediately, but have a T+2 settlement time.
A few possible answers. 1. They make lots of money and write off the cost. Tax write offs only really work if you are making (or likely to make) that profit anyway.  2. Sponsored give away. If I have a huge following I might be able to get a brand to give me the prize in exchange for exposure. (They then right the cost of this off) 3. Paid to enter. The cost of entry covers the prize. 4. Prize only given out if conditions are met. I've seen this with paid to enter "win a house" competitions. The small print says that a smaller cash prize is awarded big enough tickets are not sold. 5. Insurance backed. If the prize isn't guaranteed you can take out an insurance policy againt someone winning 6. They're just giving it away and hoping for long term exposure. (Or haven't done the maths) 7. It's a scam There are probably more, but those are the most common.
They basically indicate that you largely agree with the economic model put forward by that particular thinker, or more precisely the model that has been subsequently built up based on their work. So a "Smithian" or "free marketeer" supports the laissez-faire free market economics that derives from Adam Smith's writing (though how much he would support that is questionable). A Keynesian would support increased government spending to buoy up the economy during a depression or recession. These schools of thought are literally that. Imagine an economics professor who is an expert in the works of Marx. She would likely attract students and researchers who are interested in Marx, and so the output of their group would build on and develop Marxist economics.
Those ratios aren't fixed. They vary from day-to-day due to differing demand for the currency, due to factors like the performance of different countries' economies, whether a particular good needs to be paid for in a specific currency, relative interest rates, and so on. The  way one currency is a large multiple of another just comes about from the way the currency evolved, eg if the value of the base unit was chosen to be, say, the price of a loaf or a day's wage. Although in fact they weren't "chosen", more just "came about".
I’m pretty stupid too but what I learned is that, as things cost more money, people with less amount of money can’t keep up and people with normal amounts start to have their money lose value. Feel free to correct me
Lottery/gambling revenue does go into education, but it's not an increase of multiples. Illinois takes in about $3b in lottery revenue, with half going to prizes and half going toward education. The state currently spends about $9b on education, so that's less than 20% of total state education spending. But the majority of school funding comes from local property taxes, so the biggest factor in quality of schools are local tax rates and revenues. Some public school districts (say, in wealthy suburbs) have excellent schools. Other districts that raise and spend less locally have lower quality schools.
They do.  Around 70% of the tax revenue collected by the government is paid by the top 10%.  What the rich *don't* do is pay income taxes, because their money comes from Capital Gains, which have a much lower cut-off percentage than wages do. Which is why raising income taxes doesn't actually do much to the increase revenue when you target it on the top tax brackets,because hardly anybody falls in those brackets. Edit: corrected percentage
It's hard to explain this in simple terms because if you oversimplify economic stuff enough, trolls run out from under bridges to "Well actually..." you to death.  But the basic problem we faced as we grew is we kept making more and more money, but we can't really "make" more gold. We can mine it, sure, but the more of it we mine the harder it is to find new mines, and we don't own the entire world's gold supply.  Worse, as our technology advanced, we started finding uses for gold that were really important. So it was really clear we were going to constantly have more money than there is gold, which would mean we'd have to constantly adjust how money converts to and from gold. Financial people like the value of their money to be relatively constant, so this would be a disaster.  So we thought about the problem and asked ourselves if society really *needed* our money to be backed by a real good, or if people trusted the United States enough to take the money at face value. It turned out most of the world was happy with this arrangement. Some people still invest in gold and other commodities just in case, but there's no longer an official "I want to turn in my dollars for gold" process even though if you think about it, "buying gold" is sort of the same thing.
By essentially asking a bunch of people what it is worth. Every day, everyone asks everyone else how much a dollar is worth by buying things and agreeing on the price. It’s a little more overt when you exchange between different currencies but this is basically it.
When you don’t have money, you take a loan. Instead of going to a bank and asking for a $100MM loan, an institution can chose to issue $100MM worth of bonds that various investors can buy. Each one of them holds only a portion of the total loan, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you interest at certain intervals. To them it’s a cost to borrow, to you, it’s a profit on your investment, for the risk you are taking loaning them the money.
Someone bundles up a bunch of mortgages and sell it as an aggregate real estate investment.  An investor buys them and also buys a credit default swap in case they go bad.  The investor who sold the CDS got money in the expectation that they'd never have to pay anyone.  It's a form of insurance, which was based on the presumption that while someone might lose their job and not pay their mortgage, the chance of everybody doing it was small.  Until it wasn't.
Normally when there are 200 seats on a plane and an airline sells 200 tickets, there are always a few passengers who don't show up for the flight for various reasons. So instead the airline sells something like 205 tickets for the flight, banking on the fact that not everyone will actually turn up at the airport. When everyone does turn up, they have a problem.  Since profit margins in the airline industry are pretty slim, those few extra tickets can make the difference between a flight making money or losing money.
Employee pay is tax deductible to the business. They don't pay income tax on that. They do, however, pay Medicare and SS tax (payroll taxes), which helps fund your retirement benefit.
Supply & demand. Keep in mind we (especially in the US) depend upon stuff made in China. Even if the item is made in the US (example, cereal) the packaging most likely was made from something coming from China be it the ink for the printer or the plastic inserts that the cereal goes into.  There are four issues going on with imports right now. 1. COVID shut manufacturing & the ports in China for a long time. Once things started to resume they had to fill back orders. This caused issues at the ports & with logistic services that take products to the ports to ship. 2. Ports have a LOT of cargo to deal with & have only so many people. If there’s still reduction of employees working then that will contribute to issues at port. That backlog of products being moved is causing major, major delays around the world. In California, for example, just recently there were hundreds of ships waiting to get into port & it caused a bit of a [traffic jam on the ocean.](https://www.marketplace.org/2021/09/17/floating-traffic-jam-at-california-ports-sets-record/) 3. The Evergreen ship Ever Given also contributed to the world wide mess at the ports. They were stuck blocking the Suez Canal in Egypt & there’s absolutely no way for ships to turn around & go back so there were thousands of ships stuck for weeks. Some ships opted to go around Africa which added weeks to their routes. All those delays to all those ships resulted in shortages around the world then coupled with backlogs of ships that couldn’t get into port plus COVID. 4. Local supply issues. Certain items are harder to come by due to supply issues. Chicken for the last few months have been scarce because farmers opted to cull chickens last year due to not being able to process them & have scaled back for the time as they can’t get it processed due to labor shortages at processing plants or COVID. We’ll continue to see fresh meat, seafood, & produce to be higher in prices & less selections for at least another year.
This is actually simple, believe it or not! It's really just supply and demand. Shares act like real physical objects in *this* sense (but not some others). Sometimes more people are interested in buying shares than selling shares. But of course, during any period of time, the number bought and the number sold always have to be the same. So the way to close that gap is if some of the people who want to buy offer to pay a little bit more than the asking price. That establishes a new asking price. The same works in reverse for why prices fall. The system is so automated and processes so much volume that it creates the illusion that the prices just rise and fall automatically. But it's happening the same way other prices get set.
If they are deemed by the organisers to be at fault/deliberately caused the accident they can be fined, other than that it is just dubbed a racing incident.
The cost of a house is not the same as the cost of a mortgage. If you got a 3.9% mortgage a few years ago on a $250,000 house, you would be paying 1,301.53 monthly. If you had a 2.4% mortgage on a $350,000 house, you would be paying 1,329.00 monthly. The interest rate dropping so much means you can afford a more expensive mortgage, because the monthly payments don't get affected as much. Mortgage rates went up to around 20% in the early 80s. At 20%, a $80,000 home costs you 1,291.96 monthly. So you can see 3 different housing prices with 3 different interest rates all coming within tens of dollars on the monthly payment. So don't look at the price of the houses, look at the price of the monthly payments with the current mortgage rates.
The official exchange rate is the amount of Lebanese Pounds that the Lebanese Government promises to buy from you for $1.  So the Lebanese Government is promising that if you go to it with 1,500 Lebanese Pounds, it will pay you $1 for them.  That promise is only as good as the Lebanese Government's ability to pay you dollars in exchange for Lebanese Pounds, which in the current case in non-existent. The only people that have access to that exchange rate are a small number of entities involved in importing critical goods into the country, such as food and fuel.  As the recent fuel crisis demonstrates, the Lebanese Government no longer has enough dollars even for those critical importers. The black market rate is the actual market rate.  IE, its the rate that you would expect to get if you're not someone who the Lebanese Government has already allocated dollars to for the express purpose of importing something critical for survival in the country.
Pharmacies in the US basically set 'fake' cash prices. Insurance companies have a certain maximum that they will pay for a certain drug, but if the pharmacies cash price is lower, they will only pay the cash price. So pharmacies set crazy high cash prices to make sure they're always higher than the maximum insurance reimbursement. Companies like GoodRX go through the same middle-men (pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs) that insurance companies use to reimburse pharmacies, so they get access to the 'real' prices, not just the intentionally high cash prices.
The money you get from selling the house first goes to paying off what is left of the mortgage,  and then you keep the rest. So if you buy a house for 500k, have paid 100k into the mortgage for it, then sell it for 600k,  Of that 600k, 400k goes into what you still owe for the mortgage, and you keep the other 200k. This is obviously simplified and doesn’t include things like realtor fees, closing costs, what the interest rate and specific terms for your mortgage was. I’m just generally saying Where the the money goes.
Surplus =  an amount of something you have remaining after you've used all the "something" you needed. A budget surplus is just extra money left over after fulfilling all your needs. If you make $2000 a month and budget $800 for rent and $200 for groceries and $100 for gas, well, you budgeted $1100 and at the end of the month you'll expect to have a *surplus* of $900. Same thing happens with government spending sometimes - they need to pay for education and road repair and cops and firefighters and all that, and so they budget out money for all that stuff. And they're getting money from taxes. And maybe the money from taxes is more than enough to cover the budget for all those expenses so they end up with a surplus.
Ostensibly the point of the debt ceiling is to prevent the United States from having an unlimited amount of debt which would be bad. Practically, it's just a campaign tool that various groups can use to appeal to voters who likely aren't going to look into it deeper than a headline on facebook. It's a "problem" that only congress can solve, so it gives certain members of congress leverage in certain negotiations. It stays because the campaign against it "oh you just want unlimited debt" is really easy to run and people eat it up.
Entirely depends on the contracts that have been signed beforehand.   There is no simple way to explain this beyond that.  Various entities (companies, estates), people (authors for instance), etc may own certain percentages (or even all of it) of the IP, various people and entities (actors, directors, studios, etc) involved may have it written into their contracts that they get a certain percentage of merchandise sold and so on.
Life insurance isn't savings - you won't always get the money you've paid into it back. For instance if you cancel the policy or it lapses. You will, however, get whatever your policy limit is in the event of your death. You could start a $2MM policy next month and give them the one month installment of $100 (or whatever), get killed somehow, and the company will cut your beneficiaries a check for $2MM.
Because income tax due is not just based off of how much you make, much less just at one job. It involves other sources of income as well as any deductions that reduce their taxable income. In order for a government employee to be paid exactly what they should be minus any owed taxes every pay cycle, the government would need to know, ahead of time, how much money they/their spouse (if filing jointly) made elsewhere, as well as all of the deductions that person would claim that year. Which 95% of people would have no way of knowing until the end of the year.
The government needs money to operate. The government has trillions in debt. Collecting taxes on the wealthy will allow the government to reduce taxes on those with lower incomes, pay down the debt to give more flexibility when the next crisis hits, and to provide services it currently doesn't or provide them at a better level. Just look at all the benefits other developed nations have -- universal healthcare, paid parental leave, subsidized childcare, subsidized higher education/training, modern/functional infrastructure, etc. We could better afford all those! I wouldn't call any of that waste or junk.
Jeff bezos owns a certain number of shares of Amazon stock They multiply the current price of Amazon stock by the number of shares he owns and come up with a net worth. 99.999% of his worth is in stock not cash or property or bank accounts
A score that's created by the credit reporting companies for lenders to use to judge your ability to repay loans or pay bills in general.  The lender wants to know what are the odds you'll default on the loan.  A credit score is a quick snapshot to judge someone.
Different type of wealth building. Take somebody like Jeff Bezos... most of his wealth is Amazon stock. It's value climbs to $100B but he only pays taxes on gains when he sells. So even as his stock has gained 10's of billions in value over the past year, he isn't taxed on that. Let's say he sells $10m worth of shares to cover living expenses, he pays capital gains taxes on that, which are lower than income taxes at top income bracket -- only 20% for incomes over $441k. So in this example, assuming Bezos' shares had 0 cost basis, his $10m sale would trigger a $2m tax bill. Not nothing, but basically a rounding error vs. his wealth. The other way that some wealthy reduce taxable income is through a business. By deducting expenses "for the business" they can cut their taxable income and buy things with pre-tax dollars. Say you're a dentist who wants to vacation in Hawaii... find a Dental Conference going on there, attend and tack on a vacation after the conference -- deduct some of the hotel, meals, all the airfare, etc. to cut your true cost of vacationing in Hawaii. Maybe he leases his Mercedes through his dental practice, too, reducing his income and paying for the car with pre-taxed dollars. And that MacBook Pro he sometimes uses to update patient notes from home? Same thing...
From the time a child is born until it is 20 years old, it costs society more than it is worth.  After that, they start to contribute to society and give some return on investment.  Immigration is great, you get workers without that expensive "start up" cost. On the down side. If the immigrants have no skills and don't contribute much to society, they aren't worth the cost.  That's why there are immigration laws, to let in the most desirable ones.
There are many types of bankruptcy. First you have liquidation, where they basically say fuck it and sell off all the assets to pay off the creditors and that's it in the company shuts down. The other is reorganization where they renegotiate with the creditors to reduce the debt load by issuing them equity ownership in the company. This is the most common type especially for larger companies. This is what hertz did so it could continue operating and they were able to manage through the pandemic and the issues that was causing to allow them to take part in the upswing when the economy recovered.
Inflation is a very complex issue. It's one of the reasons it's so hard to entirely stop. People like to blame inflation on the idea that we make print too much money, but it's more complex than just that. The current inflation spike we're seeing is, like many other things in the world today, because of covid and the the supply and demand problem. In Economics 101 you learn of supply and demand. If there is a high supply and low demand for a good, the price of each individual good will be low. If there is high demand and low supply, the price for each individual good will be higher. For the past year and a half consumers haven't been spending as much money. If people don't buy things, companies make less of them and stores stock less of them. (ie "low demand") However, people are now returning to old spending patterns, but the production has been slow to adjust. So the demand for goods has gone up without the supply to match it, thus the price of each individual good has gone up. The second factor for the current inflation spike is a consequence of the governments efforts to keep the economy afloat when people weren't buying as much. Mainly this was done by the fed lowering interest rates to near 0%. That's a complex topic in and of itself as to what that actually means. However, for our purposes all you need to know is that near 0 interest rate means that people are taking out loans, primarily mortgages, to take advantage of the low interest and gain property. Unfortunately, the housing market is also limited which drives up the price for each home.  All this combines to make the current purchasing power of a dollar less than what it was, or at least make the market see it as such. That's not to say you should go out and try and buy things that hold their value. This kind of temporary inflation will normalize and it already has started to; at least in the housing market.
Why would they? And how would they maintain it? Currency exchange is a market; if you have a free floating currency, the market will determine what the rate is. If you want to control the exchange rate, you can either pump money into the market or take it out, wasting your reserves to maintain the desired rate. Or you peg it, and create black markets….
It's a cartoon. He simultaneously is broke working fast food and can't afford a balloon, and inordinately rich enough to buy shitloads of cereal to get a free toy or tons of night lights.
Insurance. Just like how a museum will have security to reduce the risk of art being stolen, when you get very large investors, they use futures of things like Index Funds to reduce their losses if markets go south. Someone, somewhere is “selling” the other side, for whatever reason.  If you do purchase a given index fund option without a clear understanding of the reasons for why, then yeah… it’s no different than betting.
Imagine taking a loan with 5% yearly interest rate while the inflation rate is 10% per year. This would mean that you will repay less (adjusted for inflation) money than you took and the bank would be losing wealth. To keep their profits they would need to charge more in interest rate so that your debt grows faster than the value of money drops.
They're basically buying up all the stock and shares of that company, so that money goes to the people who are selling them said stock/shares.
"Multi-Level Marketing" - it's like a pyramid scheme...well, it *is* a pyramid scheme, but they renamed it because everyone knew what a ripoff a pyramid scheme is
They can't loan out money they don't have. But they can loan out 90% of the money that is not theirs but rather your deposit. And since the receiver can deposit this money too this process does indeed create (virtual) money
Car sales are really weird.  Car dealerships are not owned by the car companies.  The dealerships buy cars from the manufacturer, and then sell them to individuals like you.  If they don't sell all the cars they buy, then they are loosing money paying for cars sitting on the dealership lot.  Every dealership is different, but many operate on a quota system, where each salesman is assigned a number of cars to sell during a certain period, say 50 cars per month.  Salesmen will be paid a percentage of the cost of each sale, plus a bonus if they sell the car for a relatively high price.  If a salesman is behind their target near the end of the month, they will be more desperate to sell the car, and may be willing to give up their high price bonus in order to meet their sales quota.  That said, not all dealerships operate on a quota system, and even if they do, there is no reason to believe that the quota countdown ends at the end of the month, it could be on the 15th, or the 5th, or whenever.   The non-ELI5 answer is a lot more complicated, as there are different incentives for selling cars at the manufacturer, dealership, and salesman level, any or all of which will contribute to how willing they are to make you a good deal.
Screwing your credit and not being able to buy a home for over 6 years is more than a "slap on the wrist"
Think about electronic cosmetic items for games. Once produced they have unlimited supply, but there are people willing to pay $10 for a skin so why should they give them away for free? And that's why profit is destroying the planet and how people are able to take more from civilization than they contribute
There's a few big parts of GDP: 1) Personal Consumption. This is basically all of the things people spend money on, whether it is big (cars, refrigerators), small (an apple or a t-shirt) or not a thing at all (a trip to the doctor, college). This is majority of US GDP, about 70%. 2) Business Investment. This is businesses buying software, equipment, new factories, etc. This also includes people building new houses, but not people buying existing houses. It also includes "changes in private inventory" which is a fancy way of saying "do you have more stuff in your warehouse." This is about 20% of US GDP. 3) Government spending. This is ALL government spending, from sophisticated fighter jets to the snow plow guy in your town.  This is about 15% of GDP. Wait, that's 105%? Well, last is.... 4) Net exports (or imports). All of the stuff you send to other countries minus the stuff other countries send you. Because the US is shifting to a service economy, and services are really hard to export, we are a net importer. This is -5% of US GDP. So what isn't included? Anything that was produced outside of the US. Anything that is being resold (like houses or Craigslist), transfer payments from the government (like welfare or food stamps), things that are only made to be parts of other things (aka intermediate goods), financial trades (sorry, r/WSB),  and last but not least: the black market. The gram of weed you bought from your dealer is contributing to the local economy and possibly international trade, but not the US GDP.
It's hard to give a really good explanation of a political party, because they're complicated things representing multiple viewpoints, but I'll have a go. The Labour party originated as a socialist party based in the labour movement. It’s been the UK’s second-largest party since the late 20s, though the Conservative party has held power for the majority of this period. Labour went through major changes in the 90s, which many would say turned it from a socialist to a neoliberal party, favouring free markets and very limited government intervention in the economy. 1997-2010 was the longest period of Labour government; Labour have not been in government since. The party still has close links to unions and remains to the left of the Conservative party, but in the present day it’s a centrist party. The majority of members and elected officials in the centre or centre-left, the membership leaning a bit further left/socialist, and MPs more economically liberal.  In policy terms the party favours a stronger welfare system, slightly increased public ownership. Labour has generally been in favour of more government spending over the last decade. It’s somewhat more socially liberal than the Conservative party, but still competes with them to be ‘tough on crime’. Labour is also committed to a “strong” defence policy and nuclear weapons. It’s more pro-Europe than the Conservatives, particularly in parliament.
Blood has to be collected, tested, processed, stored... all the people and facilities doing that cost money. Blood has to be transported from collection/processing sites to hospitals, that costs money. Blood has to be administered by medical professionals, who costs money and do so in facilities that cost money to run.
Are they available as online books?
All the people who invested in Evergrande as a "emerging markets infrastructure investment" will lose their money.  They will be sad, but the global economy will go on.
Well, historically wars, or other catastrophes. We're kind of in unknown territory. We've never had a stretch of more or less continuous economic growth for so long.   It probably can't last forever, and climate change and what we do in response to climate change will likely have a big impact. We've also never been quite as leveraged globally, where so much of our future earnings were promised to other people. Inflation is really good for people and governments who are borrowing money because the value of what they have to pay back is less than what they get today. But it's all a game of chicken to see who will blink first in terms of fiscal policy.
Never. You don't "pay more taxes" except that you pay taxes on more money earned. Since the top tax bracket isn't >100, you never lose money by making more money. It never crosses into being worse than straight time. Taxes are always a percentage of the next dollar earned. Going up a tax bracket doesn't touch the money you earned in the lower tax bracket. Progressive taxes mean you pay the top tax bracket's rate on only the money earned above the cutoff to enter that tax bracket.
Interest has to be paid on the loan.  Every dollar that goes towards the interest on the debt is a dollar that can’t be spent on other services. It’s worth noting that just like in your own personal life, not all debt is bad.  Taking out a loan for college that then (usually) results in higher lifetime earnings is good.  Likewise, the government borrowing and spending can often have greater returns than the interest paid on the debt.
In what context? Hyperinflation is usually a totally unwanted effect of humans not knowing what the fuck they’re doing with their currency policy... Or knowing EXACTLY what the fuck they’re doing but getting rich off of the former’s backs.
The ones that require a pin are running your card as a debit card and the others are running it as credit. Paying with credit means the business will get charged a fee from the credit card company but debit has no fees since it deducts directly from your bank account. No pin is slightly more convenient so some businesses will just choose to pay the extra fee Edit To add to my answer see u/FSchmertz [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/q4ujlj/comment/hg1mozl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) where they pointed out it is possible for merchants and/or processors to not require a pin for a debit purchase.
Just to be clear, I don’t try and run them over.
BecAuse there has been a computer chip shortage for new cars so there have been no new cArs on the market for at least 8 months...so demand went up for used cars...hence the rise in prices.
1. $45. If your Deductions exceed your revenue for tax reasons you can't use that to offset income from another source, you can carry forward the -$5 into the next year though to offset youtube profit in 2022. 2. $50.  The business made nothing so as far as taxes are concerned it didn't happen 3. $52.50. You've made an effective income of $105 so that gets taxed at 50% 4. $60. As in 3 You've made an effective income of $120 so that gets taxed at 50%
People accepting change and then never using it again, in part due to desire to limit contact with shared surfaces due to the current health situation.   When currency doesn't get reused, a lot more currency needs to be produced and distributed to fit the needs of individuals and businesses who want to use it.
The labor would be expensive.  Between the disassemble and reassemble plus the production of modified kits so the parts can all work together, it would just be expensive. When you are producing a new car you have economies of scale and the assembly process is much faster and cleaner with an assembly line
The Fed hasn't raised interest rates. That is about as straightforward a reason as possible. As to why, well there is a very conflicted role for the Fed - although they are tasked with managing inflation, they're also faced with very highly priced assets and it becomes a very delicate economic and volatile political matter to raise rates.
Places do sometimes adopt "attract tourists" as a strategy for improving their economies. It takes a lot of work, though: you've got to build the resorts, restaurants, souvenir shops, transit, etc., to serve the tourists; hire police, street sweepers, etc., to make the area seem safe and hygienic to people from relatively-rich countries who therefore have relatively-high standards for such things; launch an advertising campaign so potential tourists know what you've done; etc. All of that stuff has to be paid for *before* the tourists start arriving, so an area with a struggling economy might not be able to afford it.  It's also kind of a risky investment, since it's difficult to predict in advance how successful your advertising campaign will be, and since tourism is easily disrupted by things outside your control like weather and other places' economies.  So some locations, even if they're theoretically capable of becoming tourist destinations, might decide to invest in other economic-improvement strategies instead.
Nothing. In Canada they stopped using the penny. Instead they round to the nearest 5 cents. It costs more than 1 cent to make a penny so it doesn't make sense to make them in the first place.
There are two major ways to calculate investment returns. Okay, there's dozens, but specifically with regard to your question what you're looking for is the difference between "time-weighted" and "money-weighted" returns. There are multiple formulas to determine both, and each have their uses. Each dollar you put in or take out is weighted to come out to an aggregate performance number, and it'll look different based on how you weight the dollars in/out. The general difference is that time-weighted return does not factor in the timing of additions/withdrawals, while money-weighted return does. Said another way, time-weighted return shows the return of an investment, money-weighted return shows the return of YOUR investment in that same thing. Here's an example. Let's say you buy ABC stock with $10K, then six months later ABC has fallen 50%. On that date, you add an additional $5K and buy ABC stock with it. Over the next six months, ABC rises 100%. If it goes down 50%, it has to rise 100% to get back to even, so ABC's return is flat over this year, and thus your return is also flat on the $10K. But, your return on the additional $5K is 100%. Time-weighted return strips out that lucky timing and measures only the performance of ABC, so your total time-weighted return is still flat on the whole $15K. But, your money-weighted return will be much higher than 0% because the return on the $5K was 100% and it isn't adjusted for. If you didn't make any additions, then your money- and time-weighted returns will be the same. Since you've been contributing regularly, these two weighting methods will produce significantly different total return figures.
Logistics works out much better for large quantities. Let's say you have a part to ship. You load it in a truck and deliver it. Other than slightly increased fuel costs, it doesn't matter if you ship 1 part or the entire truckload of parts. The costs are nearly the same. Large companies will size their products to fit efficiently in trucks so they can send as few shipments as possible.
That's not really how a 4-day week works.  The idea is to do the 40 (or 50) hours of work in only 4 days.  This is to reduce fixed costs, driving from where you live to where you work, cleaning of your work clothes, ... .  It's not about making less money or doing less work.  Of course, this presumes that the customers you work with are open enough hours per day to make the concept reasonable.  If you deliver for a bakery to restaurants, they all want their bread after 9AM and before 3PM, and they want it 7 days a week.  That's not going to work, so 4-day work weeks aren't a solution for every sort of job.
Using the NYSE as an example. Many stocks are “listed” on NYSE, basically meaning that these companies are big enough to be listed on NYSE, report audited financials, and pay an annual fee to the NYSE in return for being listed there. Basically all a listing is, is the right to be traded on an exchange. The trading hours of NYSE are from 9:30am EST to 4pm EST. Beyond those hours, you can’t trade a stock on NYSE. However, there are other venues where you can trade NYSE stocks. In the US, there are about 35 exchanges, crossing networks (dark pools), and electronic communication networks (ECNs). An ECN is basically a stock exchange that does not have its own listings, but only exists to allow trading in stocks that are listed on another exchange like NASDAQ or NYSE. So what I’m trying to say is that you don’t have to trade a NYSE-listed stock on the NYSE. You could trade it on BIDS, ARCA, BATS, or Instinet. The next point is that these ECNs don’t necessarily have the same trading hours as NYSE. For example, BATS trading is open for business from 8am to 5pm. So you have an extra hour and a half to trade there before the NYSE opens, and an hour to trade there after NYSE closes. So to sum up and answer your question: the extended trading session is really just the ability to trade stocks outside of NYSE and NASDAQ market hours, by going through a trading system that opens earlier and closes later than the main exchanges.

Not receiving a salary can be a misnomer, just because you don't get a paycheck doesn't mean you don't have an expense account or get dividends from your stock. Not saying they all do that, but some do. Also keep in mind a lot of CEOs are already rich, so they have other revenue sources like investments, real estate, own other businesses, etc plus having cash in the bank. That pays the bills while they build up a company (and their investment/stocks in said company).
No.  That industrialisation also occurs on farms.  We've gone from people using hand tools to farm to people using massive machinery.  One farmer today can do the same work as hundreds just a few centuries ago.
The citizens see money that drops in value in a matter of hours, and that's so worthless that you get more heat out of burning the money than you would out of the firewood you could buy with it. You can look at [hyperinflation in Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) for a modern example, or [hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic) for an example from the earlier part of the 20th century.
The interest rate is determined between you and the bank. For most people, the interest rate is goin to be worse for larger loans; the bank is taking a bigger risk in lending more money to you. The bank has a lot of money from deposits that people make. In general, it's better to take out the least amount of money necessary. Unless you're planning to invest it into a business or some other venture which you know will have pretty good returns, it's not great for a personal to carry too much debt. This is ignoring big-ticket purchases like cars or homes, which you may need to work/live.
You don't seem to understand how the 1% "dodge taxes".  They don't do it by breaking the laws, they do it by following the laws.  Congress puts loopholes in the laws, to benefit some and not most, because this helps them retain their power.  The 1% simply use those loopholes to avoid paying taxes.  The IRS audits them all the time and finds they are following the laws. The IRS enforces laws, not fairness.
It's only going to have an impact if you do it insufficient volume. If significant amount of the bills and coins the circulation was suddenly destroyed, people would have a harder time obtaining cash and there are still many transactions, especially small ones, done in cash all the time. If you can't get cash, you can't spend cash, and if you're unwilling or unable to shift to an electronic currency exchange platform (like a debit card), you'll participate in the economy far less. Repeat that over and over and over, and the economy slows.
The streaming services have deals with record labels such as Sony, Universal and Warner which allow them to stream any music in their catalog for a certain fee. The content of these contracts is usually secret and they get renegotiated all the time but some details usually leak out. The most common payment scheme is a fixed sum per play. So every time you hit the play button on a song a few cents is going towards the artist. The record label takes these earnings and all the other earnings from distributing the song and pay it out according to the contract that the artist signed with them. So band members or their descendants will be able to pick up a check from the record label once a month.
why can’t they use the deepweb to sell organs? it’s where plenty of illegal trading happens
Norway has a national fund that it manages on behalf of its citizens. This fund has investments and such, some of which are in oil and stocks. Recently that fund has gotten big enough that it is worth more than 1 million per citizen in the country. However, this is a national fund. The individual citizens don't get that money directly. So it is a bit hyperbolic. But, it is quite the emergency fund to have for Norway. They are doing good things for their people.
The big fuss is that the lira is rapidly losing value - it's down 40% against the dollar this year (and more or less the same against the Euro), so it now costs Turks 40% more to buy things priced in dollars or Euros (or most other currencies) than it did not too long ago.  Anything imported or reliant on materials, fuel or labor from overseas is going up in lira-denominated pricing, causing substantial inflation. But the real issue is the reason for the collapse - the Turkish central bank, under the direction of Turkey's leader, continues to reduce interest rates as inflation worsens.  This is anathema to traditional monetary policy where the number one tool to keep inflation in check is raising interest rates.  In fact, when inflation spikes, the only thing a central bank NEVER does is reduce interest rates (except in Turkey in recent weeks).  Outside economies have little faith that Turkey will be able to stem inflation (and head off a worsening economic crisis) if the central bank keeps doing what it's doing.  And Turks themselves have been trading lira for other currency (and refusing to do business in lira) more and more.  It's not the absolute value of the lira v. the Euro that's the issue, it's how we got to this point and what's being done to address it.  Right now, most of the world agrees that the steps being taken are pretty much the opposite of what should be happening.
The middle and upper level managers get bonuses/advancement opportunities based on how profitable their stores are. More employees cause higher expenses which will result in lower bonuses for the managers.
It comes down to planning.  Think about having to deliver 100 packages in your city with 10 trucks. That means you have to figure out the best way to pack a bunch of trucks *and* assign a route to them. You want to use the least fuel, and you can't deliver outside certain hours. That's already a really tough problem. If something has to get from A to B in 24 hours, there are only a few planes and a few trucks it could possibly be on to do so. If the plane's not really "full" then tough, the shipper has to fly it anyway. There might not be many deliveries in the neighborhood, but it doesn't matter, a truck is going to have to go to it anyway.  On the other hand, if a person has paid less for "slower" shipping, then the route planning is easier. If the planes at the source aren't very full on the first day, the company can wait an extra day or two to conserve fuel. If there aren't many packages headed to that neighborhood when it arrives near the destination, the company can wait an extra day or two until other packages are due to conserve fuel and driver time.  That's why Amazon offers incentives to hold your packages for "Amazon day". If everyone near you agrees to let their purchases bundle up and ship on only one day, Amazon will need fewer drivers and less fuel to make those deliveries than if everybody asks for their package ASAP. When we're talking millions of deliveries, those costs add up! So TL;DR: The longer you give a shipping company to deliver a package, the more they can cut the fuel and driver time costs they need to deliver it. It doesn't cost them much to keep the box sitting in a warehouse, but it DOES cost them a lot if a driver has to go 10 minutes out of their way for 1 delivery or if a truck leaves the distribution center without a full load. Faster shipping covers these losses by charging more.
Demand is always a major motivating factor for prices. Think about what happens when there are evictions, the people who lived there don't just vanish. More people out there looking for a place to live means more demand which means higher prices. Also consider what would happen to prices when you can't evict people. Trying to raise people's rent when you can't actually make them pay probably won't work well. So prices were likely somewhat suppressed during the eviction moratorium, meaning they can be expected to rise back up afterwards. And finally, the landlords are businesses as well. They just had a good stretch where they weren't making the money they need to in order to operate, and new rents is a chance to make that back. Raising prices may be required to recover from their losses.
Color TV's worked just fine at displaying black-and-white programming AND color programming too.  So they advertised about color capabilities, and the color sets were more expensive, but not impossible to acquire.  [Prices when color TV's debuted in 1953](https://askinglot.com/how-much-did-a-black-and-white-tv-cost-in-1954).
Equity is the difference between what you owe and what the house is actually worth in the current market. If you owe 150,000$ and the house is worth 225,000$ In this market, you would have 75,000$ in equity.
 >I’d bet we’d see a lot of corporations’ quarterly earnings drop if they had to start covering the sales tax that technically is there’s to pay.   No we wouldn't. If they had to pay sales tax they'd just make their products proportionally more expensive so that the customer still pays the same price and they still make the same profit.
It can, but that's assuming people are willing to sell. Much like any other commodity, shares can only be purchased if someone is selling. And corporations are treated as people in the legal sense. So if a corporation buys back its shares, they don't belong to any one person, they belong to the company.
Simple, the original cost to them is less than a dollar per unit and therefore if you buy something worth 25 cents for a dollar then they make a profit.
Value is the intersection of a seller and a buyer. The value of your house is based on the sake of other houses in your area. The process is complex and opaque. Cars do go up in value but only some cars and only when they are older. I own a 19 year old Porsche that I bought earlier this year. Short term it has gone up in value this year because of the difficulty finding used or new cars. The same car was less last year.
Think of the debt ceiling as a personal pledge not to borrow more than a certain amount. That is sort of what it is. In the present day, this is a silly political exercise because it amounts to something like this 1) I will earn 10K this year. I have committed to spend 20K this year. Therefore, all going as planned I will borrow 10K more this year. (this is the appropriations bill) 2) I promise not to borrow more than 5K this year. (this is the debt ceiling) 3) One of the above is going to be broken.... Having said that saying that "I intend to borrow 10K this year" ie extending the debt ceiling is just giving yourself permission. It does not mean someone WILL lend me 10K more this year.  In theory, the US government can set ANY debt limit they want, it doesn't mean the financial markets will lend them that amount or there are no consequences (although for the last few decades, the US govt has not had problems borrowing) In theory, the US government doesn't have to borrow USD either - it can print as much USD as it likes to fund itself since it controls the USD creation through the Treasury and Central Bank.  The main question is what is the impact of creating money and/or borrowing. What will it spend this money on? Will it result in higher interest rate demands? Will it overstimulate the economy and create asset bubbles?
Airport shops after security tend to have higher prices. There are two properties about their customers that allow them to do this: 1. They are stuck there. They can't shop around. 2. They generally have enough money to buy a plane ticket, so they generally have enough money to pay a bit more for something.
It depends on your priorities, other people will argue that if you invest those extra funds, you could generate a return higher than 3% pretty easily, therefore you’d be better off to invest. However, extra repayments obviously mean you pay less interest over the life of the loan, which is always a good thing. I would say that if the value of your home is growing by 3% or more each year, you are investing those funds. If not though, then you may be missing out on a greater return elsewhere by not investing. Does that make sense?
This is entirely dependent on the terms of the covenant itself. Depending on the terms laid out, the business could be considered to have defaulted on that loan.
Of course specifics depend on your region. Generally 1) Oil prices are high 2) Supply chains haven't recovered from shutdowns. Less goods in the market 3) Perhaps people are now coming out of shutdowns and trying to spend more 4) Many governments were spending (pandemic spending) and increasing money supply (although some are now beginning to tighten) 5) Stock markets are high, and people might be tempted to spend more due to increased value of their investments.  Depending on where you are, inflation has been generally low for quite awhile.
If you go back in time prior to 1990 most of the world's debt is denominated in the local currency of the country where the debt was made.  So if I'm an Indian oil refiner and I want to get a loan to build a new plant, I go to a bank and get a loan that I have to pay back in Indian Rupees.  Similarly, if I'm the government of Vietnam and I want to get a loan to build a new highway, I'll go to a bank and get a loan that needs to be paid back in Vietnamese Dong (no they're not cutting people's penises off, that's what the currency there is called). The problem with this is that most of the loans that are being made to countries outside of the US/EU/Japan are being made by the US/EU/Japan.  Countries outside of that area are also incredibly corrupt.  So what happens when the Vietnamese government can't afford to pay back its loan?  It prints a shitload of Dong and uses the freshly printed currency to pay off its debt.  Because of how many Dong have been printed to satisfy this debt, the value of the Dong collapses and the lender is left with a pile of worthless currency. The solution that lenders in the US/EU/Japan came up with for this problem was to make it so that borrowers outside of those regions have to pay back their loans in dollars.  Now it doesn't matter how much the Vietnamese government devalues its currency - it still has to pay back the same amount of dollars.   Most corporate/national debt is made in the form of 20 or 30 year bonds.  In a 20 year bond you make a small interest payment each year.  Then, at the end of the 20 years, you pay back *the entirety of what you were initially loaned*.   So imagine you take a $100 loan, paid back over 20 years with an interest rate of 1%.  Each year you pay the lender $1 (1% of $100).  Then on year 20 you pay $101 (the original $100 value of the loan plus your final interest payment).  That means that to make your debt payment for year 20, you need 101 times as many dollars as you did to make your payment in year 19. Right now all of the early dollar denominated loans to the third world are starting the hit that point where the borrowers need to make that big, final payment.  That's causing a sudden surge in the need for companies and governments to get dollars.   You can view the China Evergrande situation as being a direct result of this.  Evergrande needs to make the final payment on a lot of its 20/30 year bonds right now.  It has physical assets with a sufficient value to do this (it owns a lot of land and buildings).  The problem is it can't hand the buildings to its creditors because of Chinese government restrictions on foreign land ownership.  It needs to sell the buildings to get dollars to pay off its loans.  But it needs so many dollars so quickly that its hard to find people that have that many dollars at once.
>	The only possible explanation I can think of is that maybe the majority of people are unlike me and they are willing to pay more to avoid having to move every year? This is certainly a large part of it. The costs of relocating likely meet or exceed 6 weeks of rent,  to say nothing of the headache.
A lot of European governments have been running a policy for the last decade with the aim of reducing the number of working coal and nuclear power plants. And then they rely on the market to come up with good alternatives. This have sparked a lot of investments into wind and solar power but there have been very little emphesis on power supply reliability. So in the late summer this year when there was hot weather without much wind the solar power plants oveheated and the wind power plants were standing still at the same time everyone were running their ACs on full blast energy supply have been stretched. This was the argument for making sure gas power plants were still operating and even build new ones. However due to political issues in Eastern Europe between Russia and its western neighbors there have been a lack of gas import to Europe for these power plants to run. So gas stores which were intended for the cold winter have been sold and used for power even before autumn set in. There is a similar story with hydro power with water magasines being at a record low.
The companies that make a shit ton of money off the interest donate to politicians. Getting rid of interest is great for everyone except those companies, and the politicians that get "donations" from them.
It is literally the average price in one currency that people are willing to pay for another.
The US was founded on the mythos/idea of the "rugged individual," a person/family who set out towards the "frontier" to settle the land and "create civilization". People who believe whole-heartedly in this idea of the power of the individual to overcome most/all obstacles tend to also believe that, should an apocalyptic event occur (nuclear warfare, mass human extinction, global economic collapse, etc.), they would be able to survive what comes after, if they are properly prepared. So they buy/build bunkers and stockpile them with food, water and other supplies that they think they will need after society collapses.
Australian malls almost universally include supermarkets and department stores. Your major centres will include at least one each of: Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, K-Mart, Target, Myers, David Jones, JB hi-fi. My understanding is that this is not the case in the US. The presence of supermarkets means that retail stores in Australian malls get a minimum amount of foot traffic just from being near the supermarket, which turns into enough extra sales to make the stores viable.
The Conservative Party of Canada was founded in 1867 and was the first party elected with the parties leader John A MacDonald as the first Prime Minister. However today's conservative party technically isn't the same party. Back in the 40s the party was rebranded as the 'Progressive Conservative' party of Canada in an attempt to attract more Progressive/Liberals votes. But the name is famously an oxymoron, how can you have a Progressive Conservative? It's a contradiction. The party was only elected into power a few times over the next 50 years while the Liberal Party predominantly ran the Country (most of which was under our longest serving Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau). While elected the PC party was always involved in a number of scandals. First under John Diefenbaker and the infamous cancellation of the Avro Arrow. Then Joe Clark who was Prime Minister for less than a year before being ousted by a re-elected Pierre Trudeau. Then came Brian Mulroney, possibly Canada's most infamous Prime Minister who was our version of Ronald Reagan. Under his watch - Canada suffered its worst recession since the Second World War, - Unemployment rose to the highest levels since the Great Depression, - The federal government faced high and persistent deficits, and - The Tories had introduced a much-hated new tax, the Goods and Services Tax. (The GST) - Extensive government corruption and accusations of corruption and government mismanagement were in the news, such as the Airbus affair and evidence showing Canadian peacekeepers maltreating Somalis, which resulted in the Somalia inquiry. - During the election campaign the Tories used an attack ad against Liberal leader Jean Chrétien, which appeared to mock his odd facial expressions—which were the result of Bell's palsy—and suggest he was unfit for the post of Prime Minister because of them. He ran for 2 terms but then retired from politics in disgrace being replaced by our only Female Prime Minister to date Kim Campbell. Campbell was Prime Minister for less than 6 months and was then utterly destroyed in the following election, with the PC party reduced from a majority to only 2 seats, a defeat which they arguably never recovered from. After this the Canadian Right-wing fractured and we saw the rise of Preston Manning's Reform Party. (I love that word REFFFFOOOORRRRMM) Canada's far-right party (but still less right-wing than the US republicans) After several years of effective political irrelevance due to vote splitting with the PCs and Bloc Quebecois the Reform party famously merged with the Progressive Conservatives and chose the unfortunate name of 'Canadian Conservative Alliance Party' or CCRAP for short... yes we do See Crap. This was quickly changed to 'Canadian Alliance Party' and later rebranded back to the much more obvious 'Conservative Party of Canada'. It was under this guise that they were elected into power for 3 terms with Stephen Harper at the helm.
I'm not sure what makes a currency 'good' in your opinion, but the USD is strategically controlled by the government. Inflation is an intentionally chosen effect to drive economic growth; it encourages people to invest their money instead of sitting on it.
Because the first thing in the chain went up in price, likely due to a supply/demand change. That's independent of cost of business changes you outlined.
Cable companies generally only get rights to their footprints. This is part of the negotiation for channels. It also helps that they only have to buy rights for local channels in their areas, not every place in the country  Satellite (like DISH) and pure OTT services like say Fubo TV get National rights, and get local rights everywhere. It’s not easy.  This is changing though and you’ll see cable companies soon getting National rights and more locals in order to launch steaming.  But one of the issues with streaming is that it’s hard to achieve a profitable price point and the market is crowded.
Not a professional economist, but: If the economy has fallen prey to some horrible inefficiency- like, say, pre-Revolutionary Russia- where people pursuing their own interests have managed to compromise the efficiency of the whole system, then the state putting a new economic plan into place might improve that efficiency.  Over time, though, it seems that including a large role in your economy for a market produces more growth and efficiency, possibly because you have far more people involved in making economic decisions at a lower level, instead of fewer people making those decisions with the inevitable incomplete information.  So to a certain extent, your question's not quite properly phrased- there's almost never a completely state-led economy, and those that are are *terrible*, but neither do entirely free market economies exist. The bother comes in trying to decide how much state intervention is best in an otherwise market economy (or, from the other side like Cuba, say, deciding how much free market activity you want in your state-run economy).
Being rich means that you get options on how to get your money, and those options are all taxed at different rates.  Many of those options just don't make financial sense for people who have lower income amounts or just aren't available. For example, let's say that you are worth $1B.  You can go to the bank and get a $1M loan using your $1B net worth as collateral - every bank in the world will give you that loan.  You can then use that loan to pay your living expenses for the year.  Since loans are not taxed, you pay $0 in income tax on the loan.   Next year, you go to the bank and ask for a $2M loan - $1M to pay back the first loan and another $1M to live on this year.  The bank will again happily say yes, because your $1B is more than enough collateral.  Moreover, that $1B grew to $1.1B so you have even more collateral available.  So, for another year, you get to live and pay your bills with $0 in taxable income.  You can do this for pretty much your entire life and never pay a penny in tax. That option isn't available for people like you and me.
It's transparent but anonymous. People are just wallet adresses to the blockchain. If you don't use the same adress twice noone knows it's you. The transparency is needed to make sure noone is cheating. To spend a coin you have to show in wich transaction you received it and that you didn't spend it in any previous transaction (for wich every single one in the blockchain has to be transparent) Also you can make stuff like smart contracts and just put a hash on the blockchain. That doesn't say anything about the content, but can be used to verify the contract is still unchanged
When you create a transaction it is put on the public blockchain so everyone knows your address value has changed. You can put some code there to make specific transactions only happen if other requirements are met. Some of those requirements could be waiting a set time, or sending a different transaction. Using these, crypto can become more like a bank without needing any centralized authority to keep people honest.      A good example would be trading between 2 coins. If you wanted to trade btc for eth, but you don’t trust the other guy to send their side of the deal, you can send your side as a smart contract that only executes when the other transaction is sent.
As in, one currency for the entire world?  It'd make some things easier, but it would also cause more than a few problems- mainly, who gets to control the money supply- i.e, how much money exists.
I research within the human factors and ergonomics space. This area is extremely useful to address the question you posed. Generally, if your study has implications for governmental regulations, policies or even laws, you can show how your findings conflict with, impact, or address gaps in those areas. Based on the research you are doing, are there any laws, policies or regulations that relate to current or proposed policies at the state or federal level? Your findings could also inform recommendations to change, add, or remove laws governing the topic about which your study is focused. Here is an example of a human factors diagram that might help as well. https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Human-Factors-Analysis-and-Classification-System-STAMP-HFACS-S-analyses-of-errors-and_fig3_233334384
Less bureaucracy, a unified legal / economic / banking system, one single foreign policy. The advantages are the same (just with a different name and scale) in the debate of the UK leaving the EU, or if you want to open this can of worms: compare the US with the EU. Less internal friction. SYL
A combination of causes really. Interest rates are currently low. That means people can borrow more money for their mortgages. Since people can afford to borrow more and demand is high, sellers can significantly raise their prices. They know people can borrow more and since supply is more limited than demand, people will pay whatever they can afford to pay. Since interest is low, it's uninteresting to leave money in the bank to collect interest. This means that people with the money to invest are buying houses for the purposes of renting them out. This reduces the number of available houses to buy and thus drives up the price even more. Brick and mortar is pretty much the cheapest cost involved in building a house. It's not much more expensive to build a large and fancy house than it is to build a modest house. Since demand is high and the low interest means people can borrow more, many builders are focusing on building large and expensive houses. That means there's no increase in smaller houses for more modest incomes, which means the competition for those houses is even fiercer. There's likely more situational factors but there is no one reason. It all adds up.
FedEx ground, home delivery, and express are all three separate networks. Ups does it differently and semi combines the delivery.  Or they simply missorted the box/got help
The goal is basically to put money into the economy by sending it out through banks - the banks then use it supposedly to make loans and investments in communities by funding businesses that hire people and paying for things to be built that hire and/or house people.
To default on the debt means to not pay back some money you borrowed at the agreed time. It's a bit like missing a payment on a bank loan only governments normally borrow in a slightly different way to people. Rather than going to the bank and asking for a loan the government sells bonds, these are promises to pay the bond owner back with interest at a fixed point in the future. Government bonds are considered one of the safest ways to invest money because the government always pays back. Because they are safe the government can get away with fairly low interest rates on them. The government gets a low interest way to lend money while people get a very safe investment. If the government was to default and not pay bonds back on time then the bonds become less of a safe investment. If they are less safe people will want a higher interest rate on them to balance the risk. Which means that a default will increase the interest rate the government has to pay on any money it borrows in the future.    The debt ceiling is a limit on how much the government can borrow. This is a political invention and was intended to be a way to moderate government borrowing. These days it's become another political tool to play games with. Other countries don't have these things, they simply pass a budget and the amount of borrowing required for that budget is considered to be approved. But then in most countries if the budget doesn't pass the vote to approve it that will automatically trigger an election for a new government.
The Euro is an example where many countries have done as you ask. Several countries have wanted to adopt the US Dollar as their currency, and been rebuffed by the US Treasury, who doesn't want to print extra paper money for them to share.
There have been proposals to send each American a “tax bill” where you’re told the amount to pay. Then you either pay it or you claim various deductions to reduce it, and you pay the reduced amount. [It has been successfully lobbied against by H&R Block and other tax preparers.](https://www.propublica.org/article/filing-taxes-could-be-free-simple-hr-block-intuit-lobbying-against-it)
A key viewpoint to understand is that they don’t “get away” with anything. They have financial planners and tax experts that take every advantage of existing LEGAL tax law. Why are there so many politician millionaires. That’s the question.
What happens to the money depends on the organization and how it is structured and all that. But the main issue is with budget. If you tell your bossy you need $10M to work on a project for the year but you only end up spending $8, nothing happens to that remaining $2M. But come next year, when you're asking for money, the company will be like, "Well, you clearly don't need $10M, you only need $8" and then that's all you get. So even if you get to carry over the $2M from last year to help you out this year, what about the year after that? Now you're running on a budge that is $2M less than it was. Instead it's better to simply find a use for that money now, and report that you spent the entire $10M and therefore will continue to need $10M in future years.
Airlines generally can make pretty good guesses on exactly what prices at what times will generate enough ticket sales to fill planes almost exactly full, and having to compensate for an occasional overbooking is just a minor cost of doing business. Also, competition can play a role: if an airline increases their price too much, customers may book with another airline flying the same route for a lower price.
Things are valuable because they are both rare, and people want them. If one of those two things changes, something becomes less valuable.  Like, let's say that there's only 10 autographed first edition copies of Stephen King's The Stand. He's a popular writer, and has many devoted fans interested in own those copies for their collections. So those books will sell for $1000. They are rare, and people really want them.  Let's say that Stephen King finds a box in his basement of 1000 autographed first edition copies he did years ago, and they start being sold. Now those original 10 books aren't as valuable any more. There's more of them available, so they aren't as rare, and the people who are interested have way more options to choose from now. Those 10 books used to be worth $1000 each, and now they're closer to $100 each.  Or, let's say that Stephen King is caught in a scandal involving him doing horrible things to puppies. Now a lot of people aren't big fans of him anymore, and now the value of those 10 autographed books falls because folks aren't as interested any more. No one wants to pay $1000 to buy a rare book from a guy who hurts puppies. There's a few people left willing to pay for them, but not that much!  That makes sense right, that the value of something is dependent on how rare it is, and how much people want it.  Money works much the same way. The more of a specific type of money exists, the less rare it becomes. So if you print more dollar bills, you are making dollars less rare, and gradually causing them to become less valuable. (Even if you don't tell people you are doing this, over time people start to notice the effects.)  Likewise, when a country starts printing tons of money, other countries stop trusting them as much. They see that as a sign of a country who is worried, and don't want to do as much business with them anymore. That leads to less of a desire for international trade with that country, which also lowers the value of their money. (It's sort of like if you're changing the rules of a game when you're playing with someone. They'll be less likely to play with you again in the future.) This is an oversimplification, but I hope it helps.
Not an economist, but at a *really* high level, I think it’s a few things: * The EU is heavily regulated & expensive, and highly fragmented.  It’s a tough place to start new, disruptive businesses - it lags well behind the US in startups / VC funded stuff. * Europe is traditionally a hub in finance (particularly the UK), but Brexit + the center of the world moving towards Asia and away from Europe makes this increasingly less of an advantage & growth area. * Europe excels at traditional high science research (medicine / physics / etc), but it’s waaaay behind in software & IT. This has been a huge driver of US growth recently. * It’s quite reasonable to argue that the US stock market is overvalued / in a bubble fueled by tech and low interest rates and some of said growth is speculative & artificial.
Right now, because supply chain issues causing shortages are global. Same chip shortage causing delays on new cars and appliances affect them everywhere. Delays in shipping goods and transporting then from port to store are happening everywhere, but also when a ship is delayed in one port, then it’s delayed on subsequent voyages, too.
I have never once expected my cashier to thank me, that really seems like the entitlement right there
Depends what the taxes are spent on. Like, if you tax the rich and use the extra money to wage more wars or bail out more banks then the middle and lower class won't see a lot of it. In general it would though. Government spending *mostly* helps everyone equally. (Everyone uses roads, everyone goes to schools, everyone benefits if these are financed better)
The thing is, we cannot create money as needed. Take gold, for example. Other than some highly specific uses in electronics, gold is utterly useless. You can't eat it, you can't burn it, so why do we care about it? Because it's rare. It's unusual to have it which makes it interesting to our minds. If there was infinite gold, we wouldn't give a shit about it. Same with money. Money only has value as long as it is scarce. If everybody has a gazillion units of currency, you get (hyper)inflation. This means prices go up because why demand 2 units of currency for a piece of bread when you can demand 200? Now 200 units are worth as much as 2 units used to be. Governments can't just create money out of thin air because they need to keep prices relatively stable.
Appropriation is the government saying "x amount of money goes to y purpose." And the Smithsonian gets a billion from the government because the Smithsonian is owned and run by the government.
Trust mostly. And the threat of legal prosecution if they get caught stealing card numbers. There's been several people caught skimming cards at fast food tils.
The games are called "Play to earn". They arent called "Play to earn good money". Developers dont make them to let players become rich. Developers make them to make money. By promising good gameplay, good graphics, or a chance to become rich. Whether that chance is real or not is irrelevant. Most of play to earn games crash and burn, very few manage to survive (like Entropia Online). Something is only valuable if others want to use it. If everyone plays a game to earn money, then the items earned inside the game only hold speculative value, and its just an investor bubble that eventually collapses when everyone realises that nobody wants to actually buy the stuff. See: Housing speculative bubble, etc.
PINs could be used for that reason, but very few merchant POS terminals are designed to allow a customer to enter text with anything except a numeric keypad, so long strings of text would be very difficult to enter. Alternatively, the merchant typically, as allowed in their agreements with the card processing company, could ask to verify an identification document for any reason.
This is what I do, so while I can explain, I’m not sure I can explain it like you’re five.  Attempt: we help companies make sure they’re not being stupid with their money, now or in the future.
There are several factors particular to Japan (very broadly speaking) 1) Japan is generally unwelcome to migrants. It accepts very few people into the country.  2) Japan has a shrinking population. Although still large, the population is rapidly aging. 3) Japan is relatively wealthy and has a high standard of living. It is generally difficult to find rural jobs that pay as well as in the big cities. 4) Japan's work culture is not supportive of work from home. Office hours are fairly brutal and very seniority driven. It tends be dominated by large organizations rather than small startups and entrepreneurship. Younger people find it hard to obtain financing and capital.  This reality is not unique to Japan, there are small towns in Italy that are also giving away homes. Aging and shrinking populations likely means other countries like Korea and in Europe may start seeing this happen too (outside large population centers). Young migrants willing to work for low wages and in tough jobs make a big difference to rural economies.  The land isn't deemed worthless - it is simply that there is no demand for generally economically unproductive real estate where modern amenities are often hard to find.
Movies are built on IOUs — some people/groups get a percentage of the revenue but most get a fixed amount, sometimes with some extra following the first three months of airing. Stars also get residuals which are tracked and paid out across multiple movies in fixed amounts of time. That said, Hollywood Accounting ensures that someone is always owed for something related to production, so if a movie makes 200 million at the box office, the producers and distributors will find ways to spend that money before the residuals kick in.  So it’s generally only the post 3 month income that’s actually seen by anyone involved in creating the movie beyond initial contracts/salaries.
Because more was printed and therefore each individual yen isn't worth as much. But thats just a thing of how you number things. Like, you could just forget the word dollar and pay 299 cent for your coffee and suddenly the difference isn't so big anymore. Or just adding 5 zeros to the end of every note. Nothing changed but numbers got bigger The numerical value alone doesn't say anything about how "strong" a currency is. For that you also need to compare the purchase power, I.E. what kind of things you can afford with it
Supply chains are mangled thanks to COVID-19. This means that everything from vegetables, meats, plastics, wood pallets, truck drivers, workers are in short supply. Prices are based loosely on supply and demand. Supply is low, but demand is still high. The prices go up. Higher prices = inflation.
There’s always a margin of error when it comes appraisals. An appraisal isn’t this absolute thing.  That’s a margin of error of about 10% which is a tad high but that’s why you can get multiple appraisals which should get you closer to actual market. Right now is also kind of unprecedented  as owning a home is much more accessible to the lower and middle classes so there’s not enough houses for everyone so the price goes up partly due to scarcity. And a good appraiser should account for that.
There are no laws against multiple levels of taxation, and sales taxes go to local governments as well as state. You didn’t even mention property taxes… but having different types of taxes also balance out different income/spending to more “fairly” tax everybody. Many who pay sales taxes pay little or no income taxes due to lower incomes (or under the table pay). People who save more are “rewarded” by paying a lower percentage of their income in sales tax.
> Creating a website with the ability to handle ticket transactions seems pretty straight forward. First off, it's not because of the extreme loads they take when tickets go on sale... even TicketMaster, etc. have difficulty keeping site functioning properly with the huge loads when hot shows or events go on sale. While a venue could build a site, bands and leagues don't want to have to deal with dozens of venues. It's easier for a bank to just work with TicketMaster to sell tickets for all 50 shows on their tour, have a single system to work with, a single payee to collect proceeds from.
>The part you are missing is in the word "EXPECTED" in positive expected return.      The only person who can answer that question is you, since it comes down to what **you** expect.   What do you expect the inflation rate to be in the near future? What chances do you expect does your broker/banking institute/real estate agent/legal council has of staying in business? What dividends do you expect to be distributed from your shares in the upcoming years?   All these are unknown factors.
A few reasons.  - the shareholders want to see growth not customer satisfaction ratings - if you have already won a customer, there’s a good chance that those people did some checking against competition and decided you were the best. You don’t have to improve your offering unless the competition does.  - Change/cancellation can be bothersome so unless they totally F* Up, an existing customer won’t go through the hassle of changing. They just accept mediocrity.
1) The UK's economy was *extremely* deeply integrated into that of the EU. When it left the EU, it didn't precisely come up with a means of replacing all of the portions of the UK economy that were reliant on the EU, particularly when it came to supply chains. 2) Supply chains are already stressed because of COVID, and a lot of manufacturers are moving their products into the US market because the US is emerging from the COVID recession and is both ready and willing to pay a bit of a premium for goods and services now. However, Brexit is the primary cause, as evidenced by the fact that Northern Ireland's economy is actually doing rather well thanks in major part to the fact that it's still, functionally, plugged into the EEZ.
Put simply: because it bites in people’s disposable income. Buying more expensive fuel means you have less income available for other items that people consider to be more useful. from the current already elevated prices, even a tiny increase can have a psychological effect. This is of course not a good thing for the broader economy, both from a consumer side (buy less) and a producer side (costs to produce rise)
It says exactly what is in the tin. With development of the means of prediction come new ways to produce and distribute wealth - but the powers that be will always try to keep control of things and make them stay as they are, in other words, people are set in their ways, even the rich.  It's a socioeconomic application of their opposites theory.
Mainly through soda and food sales they are marked up significantly when I was younger I worked as a store manager for speedway and we actually lost money from gas but made big profits from food snacks and soda
Easy, it's changing hands from those without money to those with. Houses are being bought up by companies. Houses are also being bought up by people with that kind of income. People without money are losing homes and moving into rentals or with family. People who theoretically would be moving into homes at the stage in their life are staying with parents or in rentals. Right now the market is being propped up. Zillow bought so many houses this year but they don't know what to do with them. Zillow often overpaid for houses and now they have an excess of inventory. https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22758176/zillow-offers-ibuyer-housing-market-inventory-investors-real-estate https://fortune.com/2021/11/02/zillow-home-flipping-ibuyer-closes-layoffs-home-prices/ https://fortune.com/2021/11/03/zillow-house-flipping-overpaid-offers-unit-bank-of-ameria/
When you earn interest on your interest. For example: 5% interest rate. Year one you save £100 and earn £5 interest. Year two you earn interest on £105 so your balance is then £110.25. Year 3 becomes £115.76 etc. A standard interest rate would just be on the original saved amount.
The value in an NFT comes *entirely* from idiots being willing to pay for NFTs. The value is in the sheer concept of your version of an infinitely available thing being unique. It's basically paying for bragging rights. Yes, you have the exact same picture I have, but I paid a bunch of money to be able to say that I paid a bunch of money for my copy.  So yeah, it is just for trading, essentially. NFTs are a bubble and that bubble will inevitably crash. Your goal as an NFT investor is simply to buy early, sell for a higher price to someone else, and make sure you're entirely cashed out before the market runs out of people stupid enough to think NFTs have value beyond what they can sell it to the next guy for.
Bookeeping?    Banks do not create currency - it has to come from somewhere, even if not hard cash. The federal government controlls the total amount of currency in circulation - they can in effect "print" more.
I have sold insurance, done medical billing, and reimbursement.  Your insurance typically operates thus.  You have a monthly payment, that your employer may help cover. This is your initial cost. You will also have a deductible and a maximum out of pocket. This works this way. If you're on a high deductible plan, your deductible can be upwards of $3500+. Or you can be on a plan with a higher monthly cost and lower deductible. You are responsible for all medical costs until your deductible is met. After that, your insurance company will pay a predetermined percentage, say 80% and you are responsible for the 20%, up until your max out of pocket is met, then the insurance will cover 100% until your annual renewal.  I have seen some great plans and some that were absolutely horrible, $5,000+ deductibles with $10,000+ out of pocket. And that was just the individual. The family deduction and out of pocket were much higher. After dealing with the criminal enterprises that are called insurance companies, from the provider side trying to get paid their expected rates, I have seen companies purposefully violate contracted agreements, knowing no one can afford to take them on. They are ripe for massive multi-billion dollar class action lawsuits. They really need to be sued into oblivion for the contract violations they perform daily. The provider I worked for had to write off tens of thousands of dollars annually because the companies refused to pay or would pay low. There is a standing letter to one of the big insurance companies that the provider's legal team sent that said the insurance company owed them over $386,000 in incorrect payments. That's just one company and one provider.
Almost every country seams to have their own ways of writing numbers. In Switzerland we use an apostrophe for digit grouping, a period for decimals and our currency after the number: 1'234'567.89 CHF Personaly I like it like that because decimals are the only symbols on the bottom, so no mixups :-)
The value of a company's stock is whatever people who want stock in the company are willing to pay for it...and whatever people who own stock are willing to sell it for. If lots of people agree the company is worth more than what the share price is...those people will buy stock in the company and the value of that stock will increase. Just as if lots of people think the price is inflated, they will sell stock they own, and the value of the stock will drop. Buying up a controlling share of stock on the open market against the wishes of the current controlling interest is a hostile take over.
Buying the house means you can sell it later. All the money you put into the mortgage you end up getting back when you sell. Renting means all the money you put into your rent is given away to a landlord, and you never see a penny back. &#x200B; Property taxes just aren't that much. We're looking at around $2-3k a **year**. It's a drop in the bucket compared to what you end up making when you sell.
Cash out = you refinance the existing loan and additional sum of money (and get a check for that extra amount at closing)  No cash out = only the remaining amount of the loan is refinanced If you need to pay off other high interest item(s) cash out makes since, if not don’t.
20% equity is 20% of the company ownership. In other words, of the value of the assets that the company owns, you're entitled to 20% of them. If the company is valued at $500,000, then you'd have $100,000 as part of your net worth. However, since the ownership is a fixed proportion of the company, the value of your share will increase as the company does better. Say 10 years later, the company is worth $10 million. Your 20% equity, if you've kept it up, would be worth $2 million.
You have a dollar, I promise miss you that I'll get you 2 dollars if you give me that dollar so you guys be me a dollar. 2 people hear that you are about to double your money so they give me a dollar each. I now have 3 dollars so I give you 2. You tell everybody that it works and a whole bunch of people sign up. Suddenly I have a bunch of money and can start paying those people. Eventually it becomes unsustainable but I have enough people signed up that I just disappear and take all the money with me.
Inflation occurs because the supply/amount of money increases. In the old days, when money came from gold/silver, this happened over time, as more gold/silver was mined out of the ground and turned into more coins. Nowadays, inflation is controlled, as central banks can issue/destroy money in a controlled fashion. It's beneficial for a small amount of inflation because it encourages people to spend money. If your money had the same value today as next year, why would you buy a TV now, when you could keep using your current, older one and buy one next year? The problem here is that the people working in the TV factory need to get TVs sold this year so they can get paid. The TV you buy next year is too late for them; they'll have been laid off by then. The worst case is deflation, where the money supply shrinks. Money is worth *more* over time. Then, no one buys anything except the necessities; why buy a TV this year when it'll be cheaper next year?
Let's say I want to buy a fancy new gold plated toilet with diamond studs and it's going to cost me a cool 1$M. No problem. I'll just sell some stock! But wait, I need to pay taxes and I'm in the 37% bracket, so I actually need to sell $1.6m. What if instead, I borrow $1m for 10 years instead? I'll need to pay that back but I can do that later. Fortunately I have $1b in stock. I can post some of that as collateral for my loan. The bank is just about guaranteed to get their money back on my loan so they can charge me an insanely low interest rate like 1.5%. So over the next 10 years my loan payments are only $107,750  per year. I'll pay a total of $77,498.00 in interest. Meanwhile the $1.6m that I would otherwise have lost (sold the stock and gave it to the toilet vendor) is still sitting there as stock. If we're being really conservative those stocks will appreciate at around 5%. So I can sell off a little of that to make my loan payments and let the rest keep growing. The first year I save around $20k and it goes up from there.
Imagine you own a big supermarket with many departments, meat, sea food, produce, paper goods, etc. Each department would be a 'division' of the company.  Everything gets sold at the same registers, and the stock crew fills up all the shelves regardless of what the product is. Now you buy a deli across town.  You own it, and have someone else running it for you.  If someone buys a loaf of bread at the deli, they pay for it there, not at your supermarket.  The deli and the supermarket might have different insurance companies, sell different brands of soda, etc. If you're the 'corporation' the deli and the supermarket are both subsidiaries.
The vast majority of gas pricing comes from the source: the price of oil on the global market. Increasing oil prices, means increasing gas prices. Oil prices have been steadily been increasing for about a year now. Right now, production of oil is a bit lower and demand for oil is rising as covid decreases.  Supply is expected to be increased in the near-term to stabilize prices
Very, very broadly: Some new financial contracts made it way less risky to give someone a loan to buy a house. Normally a single lender has to deal with the risk that the borrower won't pay. However, if you, in effect, chop up a bunch of home loans and create a new contract. You sell the rights to collect a small percentage of each of those home loans repayments to other people. Even if some people default, this new contract will still (mostly) pay out. You're less exposed to an individual borrower defaulting. Also, since these new contracts are sold, the bank making the original mortgage *really* has no skin in the game regarding the borrower's ability to repay. This made banks *much* more willing to lend to people. People who were really not able to pay were able to get cheap loans. Eventually, these people started defaulting. Enough of them did that it made these new contracts basically worthless. Since *lots* of people and institutions had bought these new contracts, a ton of people lost money. This created a huge shock throughout the financial system that created the financial crisis. In short, the housing bubble was, well, a bubble in the housing market. It was caused by a new loan arrangement whereby banks became very willing to lend to people who were not very credit worthy. Lots of those people defaulted because, well, they weren't really credit worthy. They should never have received loans for the amount they did. People had to leave their homes because they couldn't afford them.
A share is a slice of company ownership, this can be big slices from say each share being one third of the company, or in the case of large companies, there might be a billion shares each having a billionth of company ownership.  However each company has different amounts of profit it can make, large companies like Apple make a lot of profit, smaller companies like say a deli make significantly less profit.  Now it is clear that a billionth of this tiny deli probably isn't worth much, compared to a billionth of Apple which makes significantly more money. Even if we say had a millionth of this deli compared to a billionth of apple, this smaller slice of apple clearly still brings in more profit than the larger slice of the deli. This ultimately all comes down to EPS. A company not making a large profit but having many shares is clearly not going to have each share be worth a lot but a company making a large profit but with each share being worth more in ownership will be worth more. EPS generally hints towards how much a single share is worth, with a rule of thumb ballpark estimate that you multiply the EPS by 20 to get a share price estimate.
My understanding is this: huge demand at a time when Covid and labor shortages were already happening.  Stimmy checks and the US having reopened has caused a large increase in demand for goods.  Goods that as a country we are having a hard time getting to you.    Bottom line I heard from a couple of economist sources said that it may be a roast beef instead of a turkey for thanksgiving.  Adidas instead of Nike for Xmas.  You may not be able to get what you want exactly—but no concern really on any staples.   Gas will get more expensive—as will everything to a degree cause… inflation.   Plan ahead and order things early expecting a long delivery/shipping time.  Don’t panic buy and if you wait till Xmas Eve to buy the kiddos gifts…. They may be getting whatever you can find at Walgreens.
Because Private health care is, in a word, better.  If you can afford it, going private will get you treated faster, with better equipment, more efficiently, and covers treatments that (for example) the NHS will not.  Private healthcare companies take steps to make sure that their quality of care is higher than National Health services in order to get customers. So: Faster, better gear, access to treatments you can’t otherwise get, no waiting lists.
The CEO of a large company spends a lot of time speaking to shareholders, government bodies and the general public. He or she determines the identity of the company and what projects do or do not fit that identity, including both long and short term goals. The CEO directly supervises the top management of the company. Finally, the CEO ideally anticipates and prevents problems or, if necessary, reacts to and mitigates problems. For example, when Steve Jobs ran Apple the second time he looked at all the company’s projects and halted many of them. He focused the company on his vision of the computer as a digital hub for digital devices. He sold that vision both inside and outside the company. He made sure the top executives were onboard. Jobs also ensured that design and engineering worked together, rather than the engineering coming first and the design a sad afterthought. Edit: Several people have noted that Jobs was hardly a typical CEO. It’s true Jobs was more daring, creative, and ultimately successful than 99% of CEOs. That said, his actions were for the most part successful and a model for other CEOs to follow as best they can. Except for his decision to refuse early surgery, that was a bad idea. If you want to know what a bad CEO does, that’s a different question, and there are many answers. There are many ways to ruin a company. There are also lots of serviceable CEOs who lack Jobs’ creative spark and gambler’s nerve but are perfectly capable of keeping a highly successful company running smoothly for years.  Too many of those CEOs in a row, though, can lead to institutional conservatism and groupthink and a failure to foresee radical changes in the market. That’s when an entrepreneurial CEO like Jobs can (legally) steal your ideas, your brightest employees, and your customers. Right, Xerox?
The value of money is a fickle thing. Essentially, money is only worth whatever people think it's worth. There's all kinds of factors that can contribute to the rise or fall in value of a currency. Political scandals, Nefarious trade practices, and social issues are some of the most common things you'll see have a negative impact on the value of a currency.
Simply put, your caste is assigned at birth and cannot be changed.  Modern class systems are normally economic, so you can change classes as your economic situation changes.
You can ask for your hospital bill to be itemized, and you should.  Apparently it typically gets reduced if you do.
Have you ever heard of day light savings? Basically in England, they would tax you on how many windows you would have in your house. This caused a lot of house in the uk to brick in there windows so they didn’t have to pay as much. [window tax ](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/towncountry/towns/tyne-and-wear-case-study/about-the-group/housing/window-tax/)
They get money from investors. It is a growing company that claims the losses are part of investments and will lead to larger market share in the future. It's a tactic that seems to work (Amazon did it for years).
Mostly by investing in things that benefit from the whole pandemic situation. Jeff Bezos is the extreme example. His business was an insane winner because people couldn't go to regular stores and instead ordered everything online. Also big bailout programs for threatened companies that partially ended up directly in the pockets of the stockholders.
Principal hires agent. Agent works to reach principal goals. While doing so the agent does things that benefit them as well. Sometimes those benefits to the agent are detriments to the principal. Therefore to solve the problem you need better incentives for the agent that align with the principal’s interest.
Supply and demand. People want to live in California. It's beautiful. Good temp. Better jobs. Good looking people flock there. California has all kinds of stuff. Variety of restaurants, good schools, diversity of choice on everything. People will therefore spend more money to be able to live there. Basically that's why.
The value of money is (like everything) depending on the supply and demand. As money slowly gets more (wich is done on purpose) it must become less valuable because the amount of goods stays the same (or grows slower than the amount of money). Why do we cause this inflation on purpose by printing money you may ask?  Well because the alternative is much worse. A solid currency has historically caused a lot of trouble because if supply doesn't catch up with demand for money then it's value increases (deflation). And then suddenly it's a good investment to park your money in a safe  (so even more deflation because the amount of money in circulation decreases). If noone invests their money then the economy comes to a grinding halt.
It would devalue the money already in circulation. The exchange rate would plummet meaning you’d get more dollars for say euros or pounds sterling. On the plus side you’d get more tourists as everything stateside would be cheaper compared to their home country.
If more people are employed, they have more disposable income, that they can spend in restaurants, clubs, bars, clothes, etc. More profits in the places they spend their money can lead to higher wages for the staff, which they can spend.  If more people are employed, the government does not need to pay as much out in benefits, and they receive more tax money. This means they don't have to raise VAT or other costs.  So higher employment is good for the economy.
Because the stock market is not the economy. In fact, the two are increasingly unrelated. Economic indicators include unemployment, median salary, wage growth, and job creation.
Two ways: 1 ) They take your premiums and invest them. They are banking on the bet that whatever profit they make from all the investments will outweigh the cost of any paid insurance plans. 2 ) A good bit of life insurance is term limited: if you fail to die within the term limit you don't get anything (as, you know, you are still alive), and they keep the premiums you paid.
A second mortgage is a loan or lien taken against a property that already has a loan or lien against it.  So, for example, you can have a $500k house with a mortgage of $200k.  You can then get a second mortgage of $100k, meaning you now owe $300k in total on your $500k house. As for _why_ people do it, it is because they need a significant amount of cash for some reason.  Maybe they want to pay for their kid to go to school, start a new business, pay a major bill that came do, renovate their kitchen, etc.  A second mortgage is a way that you can access the equity of your home for immediate needs.
This is different for different kinds of infrastructure. Interstate highways have some funds from the state and some from the federal. Note that an interstate highway doesn't have to go between different states, Hawaii has an interstate highway because it follows the standards set by the federal government to have them help pay. If the road isn't a highway like that then it is likely funded entirely by state funds.
Not enough housing stock built in high cost areas to match demand. Not profitable enough to build more housing stock to meet all demand. Urban centers becoming more populated and the only places to find decent to high paying work. Housing stock commonly taken by multiple (decent to high) income streams, like roommates or committed partners, or matched by unlimited student loans. There’s no benefit for landlords to rent at less than market (highest possible) rates. Many landlords have recently faced months or years of no rent incoming with no recourse to evict, so new tenants are being selected by increased ability to pay. All of those are factors.
One way to think about it is that a financial "product" is a contract. It holds some parties to do certain things at certain times, usually transfer assets. A simple example is a no-interest loan. I give you some money, and after a certain amount of time, you have to give me the same amount back. A major thing that banks do is figure out more complicated contracts that are more attractive to lenders, borrowers, or (ideally) both. Typically when you "buy" a financial product, you're buying a claim to the transfers that remain in that contract. Suppose I loaned my friend some money. You could "buy" the loan from me by giving me money now, and then my friend would pay you back instead of me. We essentially just cross out my name in the contract and write in yours.
For regular millionaires (or anyone who holds stock  at all) a brokerage can loan money based off your stock. It’s called margin.  Some places can go as low as 1% interest (look up interactive brokers) If you have enough stock to live off the borrowed cash then you don’t have to sell any (except to pay the interest).  One thing to keep in mind is that the interest is all that you have to pay. Unlike other loans, brokerages don’t care if you basically never pay back the principal — they’re holding your stock and if ever they’re an issue they can sell it.  Fun fact actually — if you have enough stock this is one way to buy a house far more cheaply than a traditional mortgage. It’s another example of how the rich have more options for saving money than regular people.  The very wealthy have access to private banking services that can do basically the same thing but more customized and likely at a much lower rate.
They don’t refuse to work, they are refusing to work for less than a living wage. Many employers are not offering enough to even afford a studio apartment, much less have food and transportation. A large amount of people are finding other ways to get by.  The pandemic lockdown gave people a chance to think. Time off work to realize how bad they were getting screwed over, how much they hated their jobs, and many just can’t face going back. That is also ignoring the 600k+ dead from the virus in the last 2 years. That’s a lot of job openings right there.
I’m not sure if there’s a way to answer this question without politicizing it to some extent.  Basically, business leaders didn’t see the gains in efficiency as an opportunity to reduce hours for their workers. They saw it as an opportunity to make more stuff for less money and thus make more profit.
The real answer has to do with inheritance taxes and step-up basis.  When you inherit e.g. stocks, you get them at the value they have as the basis and do not owe the capital gains tax that would have been owed.   e.g. if you get stock at $1,000 (founder, early investor) that becomes worth $1,000,000, you would ordinarily have to pay taxes on the $999,000 capital gains when you sell it.  But if you never sell it, borrow $500,000 against it to pay your day to day needs, and then die, those who inherit your estate will sell the shares for $1,000,000 and pay back the $500,000 while owing no taxes.  There are some other more complicated structures as well, but the loans do have to get paid back.
A recession is a slowdown in spending throughout the economy... is typically caused by some economic act that causes people to pull back spending, and then it snowballs. Something like a stock market crash may cause people to feel less wealthy when their portfolio falls and companies may lay off workers when their stock price falls. Or when real estate prices crash, lending halted, etc.  While the initial cause are typically more in financial sectors/investor class people, the effects trickle down as consumers and companies tighten their belts and slow spending. This leads to layoffs, more belt tightening by the newly unemployed or people fearing for their jobs, which leads to more layoffs, etc.
Netflix has over 200 million subscribers.  That's billions per month in revenue.   By spending money on new products they not only keep their current subscribers but they attract more.
At the core it involves recruiting people who pay to join an organization, then those who were just recruited go out and recruit others who pay and it goes on. In practice they can be masked as marketing and sales job.  You pay an upfront training fee to join a company, you go out and sell products and pay may be entirely commission based.  If you refer friends, and they get "hired" and pay the training fee, you get a referral bonus.
1. What makes you think most people live on minimum income? The median income in the USA is about $36,000 per year, more than twice the federal minimum wage. 2. Amazon doesn't just make money from private people, they sell plenty of products and services to other companies.
It isn’t fair. Same as when they gave people smoking breaks but those who didn’t smoke where yelled at for getting 5 minutes of fresh air.
The first number is all you see when shopping.  It's also why buying two 10" pizzas seems like more pizza than buying one 15" pizza.
There is no real way to discuss reverse repo without a basic understanding of monetary policy and macroeconomics. Basically a reverse repo is when a Central Bank borrows short term cash from large financial institutions in exchange for some interest payment.  This usually happens when large banks and financial institutions have excess cash and no way to lend it out or invest in the short term. They basically lend the money to the Central Bank which reduces money supply.
In a lot of places you can buy a property but don’t own the rights to what’s underneath.  These are soil rights and someone could extract resources from underneath what you own because legally you own what’s on your land but not anything underneath.   It’s like airspace.  You don’t own everything in the air above your property either or they wouldn’t be able to fly planes through it without compensating you.
Modern and wealthy economies tend towards being service based (it is one of their defining characteristics. Think about a typical "wealthy" society - just the basics but it can be extrapolated 1) Food - how many times have you encountered dysentery? Food containing things that will kill you in days/weeks? How about malnutrition? Where does the infrastructure for food safety and distribution come from? 2) Healthcare - We expect specialist care, modern and available treatment. Something like COVID-19 spreading even 150 years ago would have multiple times more death. Few people die from treatable diseases and many more diseases have become temporary inconveniences rather than a death sentence. If we fall and break an arm or leg, we don't expect that there is much chance of amputation or death through sepsis - yet that wasn't the case just a few hundred years ago. 3) Education. Where does the infrastructure to support specialist training, the basic education needed, all those things we take for granted. Basic education and literacy being universal, etc are all fairly modern. Just go to less developed countries - this kind of thing doesn't come automatically. Scientific research, technological progress can only take place within a society that has the resources to foster education from the bottom up.  4) Safety - How many people die in factories and workplaces? How many have their health and lifespan destroyed by their working environment? Contrast this to poorer nations. How are these regulations enforced? How are these improvements put in place? The legal framework and enforcement mechanisms, inspections, licensing, etc are there for a reason.  Entertainment, transportation, communication, finance etc etc. The modern economy is complex and delivers a standard of living for the average person that not even kings of 200 years ago could experience. If 80% of the people are working the land or engaged in primary production, there is zero chance that there would be enough leftover labor and resources to deliver these outcomes to the average person.
"Revenue minus expenses" gives you profit. Not worth. What if a company holds onto its profits year after year? What if it invests them to increase production? What if it squandered them?
Signing a credit card payment is an antique leftover from the early days of card payments. Before there was direct payments and the internet stores that took credit cards would run them through a machine that carbon copied the raised numbers on the plastic card onto a statement which they would send to the bank to get processed manually. Signing it was your way of proving that you were the person that used the card. Businesses would also receive a letter every month that had a list of all the deactivated cards in town. It was up to the store owner to decline the card by making sure a customers card wasn't listed or they were on the hook for the purchase. My Grandfather got caught a bunch of times this way by customers at his garage. If your card was declined they would literally cut it up like they do in the movies. This was a lot easier when the bank that processed the transactions was your local bank up the street. Today it's just a useless hold over. Most of the time people use Credit cards with chips and pin codes instead, transactions are checked digitally and instantly, and anti-fraud tracks your transactions for things that are unusual like a sudden purchase out of town or in another country.
banks can borrow money from the federal reserve (right now) for way below inflation, so they are willing to loan it to you for less than inflation.
They've only gotten into the flipping business in the past several years.  Their core business model is selling ads.  Realtors, mortgage officers, insurance agents, etc all pay Zillow money for referrals.
UBI would not be on top of say social security and pensions, it would completely replace all of those, netting in a similar or even lower expense for the state - and also making ot difficult for a lot of people who get benefits. that's how it would be financed, and thus the consequences in inflation would be not as huge as one might assume.
It means the treasury (the bank account of the federal government) currently reads $0 available funds. The answer is to increase the debt ceiling to continue borrowing to keep running in the very short term. The long term answer is to adjust our spending and taxation to bring the income and outlays more closely together where this won't be such a problem. We even had a budget surplus back in the Clinton admin meaning we didn't have to borrow any money and actually had some to spare.
Steam charges you $49.99 for the game and then pays the publisher $35 for a game license.  They keep the difference. That’s why the big publishers like Ubisoft and EA and Microsoft were so interested in making their own storefronts a few years back, they want to keep the markup.
ELI5: because they don't make profits. Wait what? But they make billions! Yes and no. A profit is the surplus money a company has after paying all their expenses (e.g. material costs, rent costs, wages, loans etc.). And this is where they would pay taxes on. But companies like Amazon etc. tend to 'reinvest' all of their profits, so in the end they end up having a big turnover, but none to little 'profit' in their balance. Imagine you have a lemonade stand but instead of saving the money you make from selling the lemonade, you go ahead and buy a bigger stand, a sunshade, chairs for your customers, you employ a friend and make him CEO and pay him and yourself a fat salary, employ a researcher to improve your lemonade, a promoter to promote your lemonade, and then go ahead and buy other lemonade stands. You can estimate how much you will 'earn' from your lemonade stand and do all these things on credit (before you have the money) - your lemonade stand empire would make no profit at all. That's basically one part - the other is that these companies move their 'headquarter' to countries where taxes are low, form various sub-companies and move money around between them (by lending it to themselves, for example, and by buying and selling stuff to themselves).
Because they are lying.  Or more likely, on promos, they'll pay you in credit that you can use to place regular bets rather than actual cash you can withdraw.  So now you have $100 or $150 and start placing real bets - doesn't matter if you win or lose, the house knows that enough people like the thrill of betting enough so that if they can only give them a taste of it, they'll be long-term customers.  And the house always wins when there's enough action.  It's like a drug dealer giving out samples of addictive stuff.  If you come back for more, you're likely going to spend lots of money over the long term.
Brand awareness. You see 400 Kia adverts last month and 2 Ford adverts, what are you going to buy when you visit the dealership? 1 of those is more prominent in your head.
There are various reasons. At year-end, you have to ideally get everything wrapped up asap. Invoices sent out, everything checked, errors corrected, etc. Doing that at a busy period is hard because there's lots of things going on besides year-end which have to be sorted, and doing that when people are on holiday is hard and annoying. For example, having to do an audited FULL stock take of every single item of stock on New Year's Eve or New Year's day to ensure your financial returns are correct is not fun. In some countries, the tax year also doesn't run on the calendar year, which gives even less incentive to follow calendar years. Having your year end at your least-busy period has other advantages too. It gives you a better picture of year on year sales—people buying a week earlier or later will still fit into the same year, as will most returns, etc. The less stock in transit at year-end the better. There's also an incentive not to have year ends all at the same time. If you use external accounting services, they'll want to spread their load over the year as much as possible. Finally, there's not much reason to follow the calendar unless statute requires it. It doesn't really cause any confusion. They might simply choose to have their year start from when they founded/changed legal structure, so they have comparable year on year results from year 2.
Answer : A few companies keep track of your financial assets linked to your taxes, debts, and financial institutions. They track credit cards, mortgage payments, and several other factors that relate to your credit "worthiness". Each factor is "weighted" to create a single total number. The "importance" of this function is because credit (and other) companies want to check to make sure you can likely pay your debts before they offer you money or services. A low score will mean that certain companies won't offer their highest value products/services (or do so at higher rates) due to the implied risk that you are not good at paying your debts. In most cases, big items like cars and houses that must be financed will become meaningfully more expansive with a lower credit score, due exclusively to higher financing rates. Arguably this protects the economy by ensuring that credit is only given to people who can pay. Arguably it keeps poor people poor.
Most shareholders aren't in it to see the corporation succeed. They're looking for a return on their investment in a reasonably short ammount of time, so companies are incentivized to make decisions that will get them short term profits.
The wealth of a country is distinct from the wealth of the individuals in it or its citizens. The government cannot just take funds from an individual's wealth without legislative action or due process. So nothing would happen. You would just have someone who had more money than someone else.
The US government prints its own money, so it can’t run out. When governments that control their own currency are unable to generate enough tax/bond revenues to cover their expenses they have to print more currency to pay the bills. Since you have more *money* but no more *wealth*, this devalues all existing currency.  Do this aggressively and you can get “hyperinflation,” where the currency rapidly loses value and anything you’ve saved becomes practically worthless.
Because we haven't passed a law to get rid of it.  Simple as that. Everything the government does requires a _law_ to allow them to do it.  The 'debt ceiling' is actually just a law that authorizes the Treasury to borrow up to $X to fund government operations - they are bound by law to not exceed that number.  Thus, every time we get close to that number we have to give authorization to borrow more. A law to permanently suspend the debt limit has been discussed - basically, any authorization to _spend_ money comes with an inherent authorization to borrow to allow for that spending - but neither party has shown interest in passing that law.
It has a lot to do with decades of propaganda from our political parties that demonize any kind of social programs. You can find examples of this behavior throughout US history. It’s not that the populace would never want it, but more that they have been told it will end badly for them.
9 times out of 10 they are selling for more than they paid for it when it's on sale. That goes to show what kind of markup they put on these things when they go to sell it to you. Sometimes they are just liquidating (getting rid of) items on clearance and might just break even or lose a little bit just to try to make space for new items, though.
The "strength" of a currency doesn't really have anything to do with the units it uses. For example, which is a greater distance: 20 kilometers or 14 miles? It is 14 miles even though 20 is a higher number than 14. Similarly the units of currencies are mostly irrelevant and miss the point, you would need to talk about the average income in the countries and purchasing power parity. Instead what is usually meant when referring to a currency as being strong is that there is a high and reliable demand for that currency. The US dollar is going to be able to be traded for valuables in the future, the US government isn't going to collapse or cause hyperinflation of the dollar. There is going to be a demand for USD because people will need it to purchase things in the future. A weaker currency might have uncertainty attached to its stability or a limited usefulness for exchange, as there may not be many things one would need that currency to obtain.
Last I read, Netflix has so many subscribers that they bring in like $7B a year.  Much of that money goes to pay for the rights to show movies and TV programs produced by others.  But, as the creators of some such movies/shows (like Disney and NBC) started up their own streaming services, Netflix had to get new content to keep its subscribers.  So, they simply started using some of their subscriber-generated money to create new movies and programs.
Usually because those services are funded by local property taxes and also because the people living in the rich areas tend to make the rules. You could write a 1000 page book about this, but it turns out that in most times and places it's the rich who get to decide who gets what.
Youtube has an agreement with every music publisher that allows people to upload otherwise infringing content to the site as long as Youtube transfers the monetization rights to the video to the appropriate publisher.  So when you upload a video containing a published musician's work, Youtube just automatically handles the monetization transfer without you doing anything on your end. Its also possible for you to obtain a license to post cover videos on Youtube while retaining monetization rights.  There is something called a "mechanical license" that historically allowed people to play cover songs at live events.  Mechanical licenses don't apply to Youtube content and obtaining a license to play a cover song on Youtube requires negotiating directly with the music publisher.   That isn't something that just anyone can do.  But if your channel has enough subscribers/views then publishers will work with you to license their content. A mechanical license does allow someone to release an audio only version of their cover song.  Small Youtube cover bands don't release audio only songs because mechanical licenses cost money, which they're not going to make back if they're releasing the song for free.
Because you don't know when those peaks and dips happen. To sell/buy at a peak/dip would require you to know that, *tomorrow* the price will drop or rise. If you do, indeed, know what the price is going to do tomorrow then, yes, go to the stock market and become a billionaire.
It goes to the seller, unless you go through a broker, who may take a cut. They never appreciably sell out because there are tons and tons of stock out there. If you had enough money to dent the supply of stock out there, you wouldn’t be doing it personally; you’d have a fund manager/brokerage firm to handle it all for you.
The answer is going to vary depending on the school of economic thought the answerer comes from. But the answers all will basically be an increase in the supply of goods and services.
It is a psychological trick to alter the perception of the price of products. It also is now a historical and traditional thing.
Human Resources It’s a department at a corporation concerned with managing staff concerns, on boarding and off boarding staff, and ensuring the company is protected from risk
Dealing with any sort of money has a cost. Dealing with cash, however, costs the least. As a business, you don't need to pay a cut to the bank or the card issuer. You don't have to deal with annoying customers that buy something, decide they don't like it, and initiate a charge back that costs even more.  From a consumers perspective, not everyone has ready or easy access to credit simply because they're deemed too risky.
Because without a global gold standard for currencies a different medium has to be set up as the reference standard for trade between countries. With the US being the World's Super Power for the last 60-70 years logically many if not most countries chose to use our currency as that reference standard. When the US eventually falls out of Superpower status as all nations that attain that level of power eventually will (take it a few decades or a few centuries) a new currency or system will eventually be the standard.
They buy it dirt cheap way before they tell people, then when they get people on board, they're already selling to those people. By the time the scheduled pump happens they've already sold all their assets to the ~~suckers who thought they were going to game the market~~ participants.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias A fridge from decades ago that has survived until now will likely keep surviving, but you are ignoring all the refrigerators from decades ago that broke down after a few years. But also, machines and electronics today are much more complicated. Sure, they're more expensive and break down more easily, but they are also much safer and more energy efficient, saving you more money in the long run.
GDP includes things that don't really impact the people living in a country.  Ireland for example has a lot of its GDP from companies that are headquartered there, but the production doesn't necessarily go into Ireland, it instead goes to Switzerland or Germany.
Because the corporate media (whose owners are the same people who buy politicians) want to make it seem like it’s all one persons fault, and they want to make it seem preventable by voting someone in or out of office.  The alternative would be to talk about the long term policy and geopolitical causes, which would point to how the entire system is corrupt and doesn’t work for the people. Like if they were to report on how many billions we spend subsidizing big oil companies, yet we don’t feel the difference at the pump, that would disenfranchise people, and make them anti-government in general, instead of just anti-democrat or anti-Republican.
People create things that have value by transforming things that currently exist into more useful forms. Think about a tool, like a hammer. A hammer is objectively valuable and helpful. But that started out as metal in the ground and a tree.  So people dug up that metal and transformed into the head of a hammer. And some other people cut down a tree and turned it into the handle of this hammer. Some other people assembled this hammer. Where you once and dirt and trees, you now have a hammer. This is the same process for creation of all wealth. We take something that isn't useful and we make it useful. Computer code for example is just a bunch of memory stored on a computer somewhere, but all we do is arrange the memory on the computer in a particular way and then we have a valuable program. Heck, a house was once just a bunch of lumber, copper, and concrete, sand, etc. If I just gave you a pile of all the raw materials that were used to create your house it wouldn't be valuable to you, not as much as having an actual house that's for sure.
The US is wealthier than nearly every nation in Europe (Norway is similar and a few micro nations pass it).  We usually group Western Europe with the US, but there's a gap (the US has 20% more GDP per person than Germany for example).   Americans have less off time than most Europeans.  Germany mandates 34 days off a year, America mandates 0.  An annual salary in the US covers almost 1,750 hours worked per year, while in Germany the average is more like 1,350.   Those two factors multiply, meaning identical workers in the US and Germany should expect the US employee to have 50% higher annual salaries.   However the biggest item is that the US has fewer regulations on employment markets than most European nations.  That means it's easier to fire people in the US, but also means that top performers are better able to negotiate pay commensurate with the value they produce, too.  It creates much higher inequality because the top of the US pay is much higher.
The general answer is: currency, much like everything else, follows the laws of supply and demand.  If a country A exports a lot towards B A's currency will be in strong demand (because usually you don't accept random currencies when you're selling something, you want your own currency so you can pay employees, taxes, ...), so its exchange rate with B will go up. If A, instead, imports a lot from B, B will be in a stronger position and A's exchange rate with B will go down (because B's exchange rate with A goes up). Also, if a country is growing, foreign investors will try to invest more of their money in that country's bonds, increasing the demand of that currency, which brings the exchange rate up. All these things change every day, which lead to currency fluctuations. EDIT Just for the sake of completeness, part of this can be simply due to certain statements by central banks and high level politicians. If they make a statement which leads to believe that country will grow, and they are considered reliable, people will invest more in that country's currency. If, on the other hand, that country is expected to decline (or people mistrust the high level officials who made certain statements), investors will invest less in that country.
It is basically health insurance, but for pets.  You pay a monthly fee and if your pet needs expensive care (beyond normal vet visits) the insurance will pay.
It usually happens when there's little confidence in a country's government. 1923 Germany is a great example of this. If I'm not positive a country will even be AROUND in a few years, I'm going to require more currency from you in exchange for anything to offset my risk. It's the same way that people with bad credit require more collateral for a loan than people with good credit: it's a way of mitigating risk.
Other companies innovated while those went stagnant.  AOL was it's own network for the most part.  You actually left their network for other content.  Today almost everything resides on the internet proper.
If you have a worker that brings 200 dollars to your company, usually you’ll pay them 100 dollars. That’s how you get richer as an owner.  Essentially you take as much as you can from the working class, while investing part of your income to make more money. Rich people can afford to invest often.
The short answer is, "Whose money will you burn?". The shorter answer is, "We can." The longer answer is, "They didn't actually *print* additional money, the number of physical dollar bills in circulation is not profoundly larger than it was a couple of years ago." This is pretty simple, actually, when was the last time you paid cash for something? So, how does new money get injected into the economy? For the United States, that answer is, the United States Federal Reserve board of governors Open Market Committee decides on how much interest it will charge lending institutions for an overnight loan. This is rate is also used by banks to lend money to each other, and is referred to as the 'Federal Funds Rate'. The higher that rate, the more expensive it is for banks to operate and lend money, and those costs are passed along into the general economy. So, when the Fed wants to tighten money, and revalue currency they'll raise the Federal Funds Rate, and that will make it more expensive for people seeking loans to obtain them. The problem that this is a very slow-acting, lagging process, because the loans made yesterday are made at yesterday's interest rates. This actually happened, back in the 1980's, after years of inflation between the 'Nixon Shock' in 1971, when the U.S. government abandoned all pretense of being backed by gold, and when Paul Volcker's Fed's policies started to be felt. By June 1981, Volcker's Fed raised the FFR to 20%. It also triggered a massive recession, in which the national unemployment rate reached over 10%. So, if the current spike in prices stays consistent, you can expect a similar reaction from the Fed, as lending institutions lobby the government to change policies to protect their industry. When you make a 30 year fixed-rate loan, you're making a bet that the value of the money you're going to be paid back will not be entirely eaten away by inflation. And the Federal Reserve is the house, in Casino terms.
Moratorium means "temporarily not enforced". So just because they can't kick you out doesn't mean you stop owing the money. The landlord can still sue you to pay, and eventually a court confiscates your wage or you declare bankruptcy. So basically the same reason why you can't just take a loan and refuse to pay it back. Where I live kicking out tenants is generally quite hard, especially when they have children. So whats your moratorium is our normal condition. (But we also have a social system that pays your rent if you can't)
>If i produce bottled water i buy water bottles and fill them with water. Why do i not buy plastic and make my own bottles? Why does it not actually save on costs from paying another company and taxes from buying/selling, and also possibly transportation?      You can do it if you have enough capital. It's called vertical integration.      But as I said it comes at an enormous upfront cost because in order to own and control 10 different parts of a supply chain instead of just 1 you will need ten times the resources, ten times the business contacts, ten times the specialized equipment, ten times the specialized personnel.   Instead of one business you're now managing ten. You'll also have to deal with antitrust concerns.
It depends on where you go. But in general, Pepsi and Coca-Cola offer discounts to restaurants that agree to only serve one brand and not the other. So many restaurants pick just one to serve.
Are you asking what the problem with money laundering is?  It is illegal because money is being shifted to either avoid taxes or taking money that was gained through illegal means and "clean" it.
The board of directors are representative of the owners of the company (ie the shareholders in a public company). In theory, they are the highest authority within the company - the CEO, CFO etc answer to and are hired by the board of directors. The BOD is typically responsible for approving all major decisions within the company.  Directors generally receive some compensation for their time. They are appointed by shareholders at the general meeting (typically held annually). Since most directors (for large companies) are rather wealthy and influential in their own right, they have to be invited - many times because they (the director) themselves bring some prestige to the company. Some directors are directly nominated by big shareholders, although technically they are "voted in" by all the shareholders (according to the by laws of the company).
Total assets minus total liabilities/costs. So if someone has $1 billion in assets but has $500 million in outgoing expenses, they have a $500 million net worth.
As a reformed project manager (not civil): unlike in some fields like maybe software, or in infrastructure projects where more of the entire project is _entirely_ under you control (say in building an airport or erecting a new chemical refinery), civil projects have SOOO many pieces going on. And quite a few of them are NOT under your control.  If you work for BP and you're building a new refinery, you've done your environmental compliance assessment, you've lined up your contractors years in advance, you own the land and you don't care about the interruption to your other facilities - you've already dealt with it to as to not interrupt. And if your workers have to go the long way around, well, you're just paying them overtime. THe only one affected is you/your corporation.  Civil projects: well you gotta have public consultations, you have to re-route utilities, redirect traffic, do site work and thousands of other things _before you sink a shovel_. AND, all the things to reverse this are scheduled to happen AFTER the bridge is done. If ANYTHING goes wrong with the actual bridge building, everything gets thrown for a loop. Bus line 207 got re-routed but was scheduled to resume over the bridge next week? The re-route requires six additional bussess per shift, that's six extra drivers, six extra busses. They're needed to backfill the south boulevard re-route because of the new sewer on Ocean st. in a week. If the bridge project takes longer now I need six MORE buses and drivers. Oh and you have no direct control over this, this is the transit planner and they don't like you by the way.  So, you can mitigate a lot of these by having contingnecy plans. But those require resources to be reserved and allocated all of which costs money. I can plan you a project that comes in on schedule but if it has to be able to absorb any and all possibilities itll cost you - you probably won't like it.  A good example: my city was laying a railway underpass. Every day the rail line was disrupted cost the city $XXXXXX.  They're pouring concrete in Febuary... in Canada. The weather was forecast to be good for _that particular week_, but below a certain temperature concrete doesn't set right or it cracks or something (I dunno, Im not civil). So to protect the pour they threw up a big heated tent large enough for the machines and shotcrete trucks. Cost like $1.2M. Oh my god did the peons have a field day with _that_. Never mind that had the bridge not been completed on time (and if the concrete doesn't pour correctly you have to do it over. All of it.) the city would have been paying the railway like $100k per day or more. So $1.2M to protect against what could have been much more than that... seems like a deal to me.  So yeah. Civil projects are a balance between cost and what the city can afford, minimizing interactions with other government departments, minimizing disruption to people, business and traffic. There's lots of communication and inter-dependency and if _anything_ goes wrong (heaven forbid your archeology survey didn't catch an indigenous burial ground) everything else falls apart or falls into some very expensive contingency plans.
Importing: Bringing something to your country from foreign ones. Exporting: Sending something from your country to foreign countries.
Inflation is calculated using something called the "Consumer Price Index" or CPI. Its basically an average of the prices for things that a person would generally need. Tracking the change in the CPI over time gives the relative change in prices over time, and therefore, the inflation. Then, you can work backwards from that inflation rate, and see what your wage is/should be. It's impossible to tell what the "perfect" wage inflation calculation should be, because inflation changes year by year, so while this last year had 6.8% price increase, other years have around 2%. That's about what you should be asking for in a raise to counteract inflation.
Trend. People love the idea of significant yielding investments to the point of not even thinking first.
The reverse repo market is one of the many ways that the Federal Reserve tries to keep inflation in check. The fact that it's this large means that the Federal Reserve is somewhat concerned about inflation in the near future.
Unfortunately border customs is pretty corrupt in Mexico, I've had to put people on a plane and fly them to Mexico to get any type of electronics safely through to their destination.  Multiple attempts to send laptops to employees in Mexico resulted in a box with a much lower-end laptop or sometimes just some rocks. So companies don't want to have to deal with that on a constant basis.
Entirely by package size  And whatever they get from their upstream suppliers  Whereas in 2000 maybe you'd get a 12oz cereal box for $1, now maybe it's 8oz Or 9 sponges in a pack, but now it's 4
Well, for one, the premise is largely false. Prices rose dramatically in the Bush years before cratering during the financial crisis. Prices rose again following the Arab Spring before crashing as a result of the fracking boom in 2014. Prices have risen again more recently for a variety of reasons (OPEC not agreeing to output increases, general inflation from the covid recovery, massive stimulus by governments around the world, etc.). You'll note that basically none of the causes here have anything to do with the party in power in Congress or the presidency. Prices rose during the Bush years (principally) due to the collapse of Iraq's output and sanctions on Iran preventing their exports. The financial crisis, as mentioned earlier, caused a brief crash. The Arab Spring drove the next increase, and US fracking drove the next collapse (both of which occurred under a Democrat). TL;DR, the president, let alone their party, has very little impact on gas prices. This can all be seen in an [excellent graph](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GASREGW) from the Fed.
The short answer is that they aren't filing for bankruptcy. They created a separate company. They transferred all of the liabilities for future lawsuits about them putting asbestos in talc to that company. And then that spin off company has filed for bankruptcy. It's a commercial move to limit how much money they have to pay out in compensation claims rather than anything to do with the main company being short on cash. Legally very smart. Morally about what you'd expect from a company that knowingly sold a baby product they knew was contaminated with carcinogenic chemicals for several decades.
Taxes are higher in Europe compared to the United States, and those taxes are used to fund programs such as healthcare or government subsidized universities.
The DOW is a collection of 30 of the largest Companies on the US stock exchange, S&P500 is a collection of 500 of the largest US companies, and Nasdaq is a separate stock exchange where most of the tech companies are traded. The $35k figure is the current value of the DOW index, -$93 is the change in value since yesterday’s closing price and -.25% is the percent change in value since yesterday.
They are [the same thing](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/statutes/): >An Act of Parliament (also called a statute) is a law made by the UK Parliament. Statute law is distinct from other kinds of law, such as case law, which is established by the courts.
No because those profits gets pooled by the ultra rich owners of those companies who become billionaires while their workers stay on minimum wage.
The sad truth is that the more money you have, the easier it is to make.  Many of the elite wealthy (multi-millionaires are at the low end of this list) own the means of production.  They own the companies we work for.  As such they don’t have to put in the 40 hour grind.  At a certain level money becomes a number to them, as they earn it back very quickly and they want for nothing.  Some billionaires literally make money faster than they can realistically spend it.  They often buy things just for social status among their own elite circle.  This wealth inequality huge problem globally, and a crisis like the pandemic or the 2008 recession don’t hurt people like this, but rather make them richer.  When you’ve got that kind of cash a recession is just a discount sale.  In Las Vegas entire neighborhoods were purchased at very low rates when the mortgage economy crashed.  People were losing their homes and the rich were turning them into rental properties.  This happens every day and eventually it creates a world where everything is expensive and normal people don’t OWN anything anymore.  So instead you sell the only thing that is yours - your time.
The general idea is that if rich people and businesses have more money then they will provide more jobs and potentially higher paying jobs. The more people with money, they more they can spend to stimulate the economy.   In practice, it was a huge failure. Rich people hoard their money. Businesses invest in themselves and workers wages don’t increase.
All stock is is a % ownership of the company.  Assets - Liabilities = Shareholder Equity (Stock). So, in a simple company lets say we have $1M in cash, no liabilities, and 1,000 shares of stock outstanding.  Each share is worth $1,000 ($1M / 1,000 shares). Now, lets say the company creates 1,000 more shares of stock and sells them for $1,000 a piece.  The company now has $2M in cash with 2,000 shares of stock outstanding.  Each share is still worth $1,000 ($2M / 2,000 shares). Each share of stock is a smaller % ownership, but since the value of the company is higher, each share is worth the same.
Low interest rates means companies can loan cheap money to invest in their companies thus creating jobs. If interest were high, companies wouldnt be able to invest as much thus leading to fewer jobs being created.
Basically, because farms are charging you a \*lot\* more when you buy direct from them than what they charge the supermarket for. A big chunk of that is value pricing...most people are willing to pay more for direct-from-farm food, so the farmers charge what people are willing to pay. The other part is overhead...the farmer expends basically the same effort/cost to grow an ear of corn whether they sell it to you or a supermarket. But for the supermarket they just dump the corn from their harvester truck straight into a megabin that goes to the supermarket, the incremental handling is very small. For you, they have to create/maintain/staff some kind of storefront to sell the corn, handle tiny numbers at a time, deal with the payments, etc., etc. The supermarket has a \*massive\* logistics operation to do that at very large scale and high efficiency, the farmer can't hope to compete with that, so their costs are higher, so they're willing to sell to the supermarket much cheaper than they're willing to sell to you. And if you're talking small local farms, they're not typically selling to large supermarket chains at all so they're not even operating in the same market space.
Bankruptcy doesn't mean the person or organization has no money or assets. It just means they are unable to meet their debt obligations on time or in full. By declaring bankruptcy the courts intervene and will try to arrange a way for the debts to be paid off in as expedient a way as possible while not completely financially destroying the organization or individual along the way. So Hertz would still have money and still be able to operate despite going through bankruptcy. Then, buying more cars doesn't necessarily mean they need to pay it all up front in cash. What happens is they borrow money to purchase the cars and then those loans have a time frame to be paid off. Even a company that can't pay loans due *today* may be able to pay other loans off over the coming years.
You have some good intuition there - if the stock market represents corporate profits, how can corporate profits increase at a rate of 10% while the economy only increases at 2-3%?  Well, there are a couple of reasons. 1 - First of all, that 2-3% is after inflation, and the 10% is before inflation... so it's more like 2-3% for the economy, and 7-8% for the stock market. 2 - There are other ways for the market to give you returns than just increasing profits.  Dividends and stock buybacks can give you great returns as a stockholder without actually increasing profits.   3 - Corporate profits are increasing as a share of the economy - maybe corporate profits were 18% of the economy last year but are 19% this year?  Then corporate profits will be growing faster than the economy. 4 - Last one - investors can bid the value of the market up for no reason at all.  Maybe last year corporations earned $10 billion and this year they earn $10 billion... maybe I just like this year better, or maybe my alternative for investing my money (like bonds) got worse.  You would see this in the market as an increasing P/E ratio.
The general point of tax haven is to manage tax liability not to evade it. This comes up mostly when doing international transactions. (ie if you live in the US and trade in the US, then US taxes due will generally be paid). But the question is more complicated when trading internationally. By forming trusts and incorporating in other countries, the profits generated are taxed (if any) at the prevailing rates of that other country (ie still legal).  The idea is to manage the amount of tax paid and when taxes need to be paid. Evasion is illegal - meaning to NOT pay taxes that are due. Tax management is about timing and making "best" use of other tax jurisdictions - the taxes necessary will be paid (ie not evaded). The point is that it will generally be less than if all the transactions were recorded locally.
It's not the robots replacing workers that you need to worry about.  A lot of the things you do are way more complicated than you realize. Try making your next meal like a robot. Think about every single time you move your arm or finger, somebody needs to program that movement.  A robot can't feel, so you need to tell it exactly how much force to use or else it will crush everything it touches. If you need to see something, the robot needs to see it too.  Can you recognize the ingredients?  A robot can't, somebody will need to teach them to recognize the ingredients. Can you smell something burning?  A robot can't.  How do you interrupt what you're doing to salvage the meal? Robots in factories are great because they do one thing over and over.  A robot cutting onions can do that all day and cut 1000 times the amount that a person could.  But in a restaurant you don't need that many onions, so it's not worth buying an onion cutting robot. Now ... What you do need to worry about is AI.  AI isn't going to automate the person that cuts onions, it will automate the person that orders the onions online, and the person guessing how many onions you'll need next week, and the accountant that's seeing how many onions you can pay for. These are all "good" jobs today, and in twenty years most of them won't exist.  My opinion is that there will be a period of poverty and civil unrest, like the Great Depression.  Then the government will enact UBI and we'll move toward a post scarcity form of culture.  (We won't actually be post scarcity at this point but the richer countries will be able to act like it.)
The float is just the amount of cash that's in the register at the start of the day - usually it's mostly smaller bills and coins, so that you can make change for customers who pay in bigger bills throughout the day.  After all, if people will often buy their lunch with a $10 or a $20, you'll need a lot of $1 bills and coins to make change, while the till fills up with higher bills. If you have too small a float, you might run out of change for a customer, which is an annoying process because you might have to make them wait so that a manager can open up a safe and get the proper change.  When counting the till at the end of the day, whoever's in charge usually makes sure that the total in the drawer matches with the total amount of cash sales *plus* the float amount.  If the number's off, it means that the cashier made a mistake somewhere.
One big difference is the capital gains tax vs standard income tax. For a rich person, the capital gains tax is much lower than the upper tax brackets their income would put them in. So by investing, holding that investment for a year, then selling it, you're already paying less taxes. With enough diversity, you can even get more creative. You'll likely have a number of "winner" and "loser" investments. By selling off some of the losers, it lowers your tax liability, thereby allowing more direct control over how much you end up owing. And if you own a business? Depending on your type of business, you can deduct all sorts of things as business expenses as long as you have some way of justifying that they have some business purpose.
The cost of physically printing a book is a small percentage of its price to begin with, and this is usually reflected in a small difference in price. Most of the costs are the same - paying the author and everyone involved in the publishing process.
it sounds like they didn't sell the full amount of shares that they wanted to in the IPO, so the underwriter is buying a bunch at $20 (a lower price than the market price).  this will make the market value go down.
Nominal worth is just a number, it doesn't relate to its economic value. You could redefine a "new Euro = 10 old Euro" and everything would stay the same, but its "worth" against the USD would change. What matters is stability over time. From a historical perspective, the Euro is just too young. It's barely 20 years old in general, and many countries have adopted it even later.
Because they don't want to pay suitable wages. There's no such thing as a labor shortage. Only businesses not being willing to pay for talent.
Your SSN is broken into three parts: area, sequence and serial. The area (first three numbers) indicate where you were born (or initially issued your SSN). If someone knows this information, they don't need the first three numbers of your SSN. The sequence (next two) is based on when you were born. If someone knows when you were born, they don't need this information. The serial is unique to you and is almost impossible to guess simply from publicly available information. As such, it's the most important part of your SSN to safeguard - and the most identifying. So if I ask you "When and where were you born and what are you last four?", I now know your entire SSN.
America is in the top 5 for producing agricultural products sold globally. I’m not sure what you mean by not producing much for the rest of the world.
So essentially the U.S. runs on credit. Every so often we have to raise our credit limit (the debt ceiling). We pay down our debt by issuing U.S. Treasury Bonds. Once we run out of credit, the Treasury Bonds will lose their value. This leads to nasty things. Interest rates spike and stock price plunge. We also could implement a government spending freeze which would reduce or eliminate funding for food assistance, Medicare and Social Security, payments to veterans, and Federal worker salaries.
For oil at the very least, the us has negotiated with middle eastern countries to provide military protection in exchange for these countries selling their oil in dollars. This has created a massive demand for us dollars, artificially increasing its value to the benefit of Americans. Two Arab leaders have announced their desire to start selling their oil in euros instead. Their names were muhamar gadafi and Saddam Hussain.
The taxes taken out now are an estimate for what you will owe at the end of the year. When your taxes are due, you or a tax professional will organize the money you earned and your personal situation, and if you overpaid throughout the year, the IRS will refund you the difference between what you paid and what you owe.
You're assuming people are using bitcoin as currency. By and large, they aren't. They're treating bitcoin as an investment - they aren't going to spend it, they're going to sit on it until they think the price has peaked and then cash out. The people spending bitcoin are mostly people looking for an immediate purchase they can't make with regular currency (whether that's because it's questionably legal, because payment processors won't work with them, because the official currency of their nation is a shitshow, or some other reason) so they don't really have a choice to keep their crypto. They buy in, transfer immediately, and the other guy likely cashes out ASAP as well.
They don't even really do it for the taxes they do it for good PR. As an example door dash gave sesame street 1 million this year. They then spend 5.5 million on adverting telling people that they gave 1 million.
It depends who is/are the beneficiaries of the policy. The insurance company will cut a check to each beneficiary separately. Generally, no income taxes are owed on life insurance proceeds. Source: am a trusts/estates attorney
Because the USA has significant influence won the world economy. It is the largest economy in the world. If the USA stops buying things, manufacturing across the world takes a hit. And the financial institutions that collapsed in 2008 also had significant influence and investments around the world. Plus, at least when it comes to things like stock markets. A lot of that value in the market comes from belief or trust in it. When something happens that hurts that belief or trust that investing your money in the market is a good idea, investors pull their money out of the market, causing it to tank.
The managers aren't buying bonds with their own money, they are buying them with the money of "us", the investors. That is what the managers are managing, they manage other people's investment money.
Essentially a pool of similar debt, securitized into a asset you can buy in the open market. It’s based off of the underlying cash flows and rents/leases of the companies involved in the security itself. Almost like an ETF, but on the debt side.
First we have to define the term rich. There are people who work for their money like doctors, or small business owners who still work daily in their stores / restaurants. This is not who is being referred to when people say tax the rich. The rich they are referring to are not what we would call the working rich. You can work hard and with a healthy dose of luck earn a millions dollars over the course of a couple years.  But you can only steal a billion dollars from the work of thousands and thousands of other people most of whom are paid so little they struggle to live.  Let's take this one step further and just do a logic experiment about who is better for the economy as well. If one person has a billion dollars How many pairs of jeans do they buy? How many times a week do they eat out at a local restaurant? Now if you spread a billion dollars out over 100 million people, how many more times has a local restaurant had a patron? How many more items have been purchased in stores and online? One person hoarding their stolen billion dollars is not really good for the economy while a 100 million people all spending a bit of extra money this week is amazing for our local industries. Let's also not forget that the tax rate used to be over 90% for the truly rich. And that a graduated tax system means you only pay money over a certain threshold, so you are not hurting what's most people would refer to as the working rich.  And finally, the actual rich don't currently pay taxes. My wife and I who are financially on the low end of middle income paid more taxes than Jeff bezos and Elon musk put together last year. So I'm not even arguing we should massively tax the rich, but they aren't even paying their fair share as a percentage of their hoarded wealth.  And before someone starts saying yes but they don't have access to that capital, you misunderstand how stocks work. Stock prices go up by predatory business practices and paying workers as little as possible thereby increasing your net worth. Stock can also be given away as both bonuses and part of compensation to workers within a company. There are many ways that the disgusting wealth of the rich can be paid to the workers actually making those companies function.
Who gets to decide when more money is printed? What's stopping the Zimbabwe government  just printing out thousands of trillions of dollars of this currency and distributing it, now the global economy just collapsed.
This kind of question seems to comes up most days, so try some different [search](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/search?q=exchange+rate&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) [terms](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/search?q=currency+value&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) and you'll get lots of answers.
Not much.  There are 330 million people in the US, so 95% of that would be approx 313 million people.  If you take Bezos as the richest person in the US at around 200 billion, and split it evenly, each person would only get $639.  It would cause inflation to go up a bit, but not significantly.  That' s not even 1 month's rent for most people, and the Feds gave out trillions of dollars in stimulus for Covid already. However, him selling all his amazon shares would tank the value of Amazon and cause a stock market crash for sure, but that's a much more complicated thing to discuss, so I won't go into depth on that.
The production budget doesn’t include marketing. I believe the rule of thumb is that after marketing, a movie needs to make roughly twice its production budget to be profitable, but I could be wrong on that part
I think there is way more than enough. Modern farming techniques have been almost a miracle. It’s distribution that’s messed up… like even if you sent food and goods to some very poor countries (and we do), their corrupt governments would prevent it from reaching the people.
Unemployment numbers represent the people who are actively looking for work.  If a person is not willing to work for the wages being offered and is not looking for work, they aren't represented in that statistic.
It does, but its nowhere near the impact that some business owners and anti-living wage pundits_claim_ it has.  lets steal actual numbers from Subway. A turkey footlong is $5.89 normally. Franchisee sees $1.20 of that gross. The food cost for that turkey footlong in NYC is $1.65 meaning $3.04 is labour and store overhead.  Now, the 12" sub I get at subway takes my local artiste two minutes (don't ask why I timed them) on average. If the lunch rush is solid, that means the artiste is making 30 subs per hour. They get paid $0.50 per sub.  Meanwhile the sub artist is getting paid $15 per hour. If we wanted to be Kris Kringle and give our subway artist a whopping $5/hr raise, that adds ... <math>... _seventeen_ cents to the price of my sub. Absolutely nothing else changed in that original equation. My $5.89 footlong is now $6.06.  Big whupdedoo.  But to that sammich shuffler that $5 per hour is a big fucking deal.  I don't begrudge the franchisee from making some of that $2.50 per sub - commercial real estate isn't cheap, plus utilities and they gotta pay a franchise fee etc.  But when they say that paying employees better is a can't, what they're really saying is they won't. **edit:** ok, Im being taken to task by some armchair economists. And they're right. My example is a gross oversimplification of the massively complex economic ecology that is the sandwich supply chain.  Yes, they're correct. All of the ancillary supply chain workers and corresponding cost of goods will be upwards affected by a $5 bump to workers wages. Figure a few cents per ingredient.  Yes, the subway doesn't sling subs all day long. For many hours the sub artist will be in the back slicing tomatoes and baking the bread. Remember that $2.50 in the middle that the franchisee takes from the middle of each sub before his $1.20 gross profit and after the $1.65 of food cost? Tomato slicing hours come out of _that_.  Yes, if you roll up the cascading wage impact on the entire sub supply chain AND pass some of the tomato slicing buck onto consumers you could see maybe a whole dollar or even two tacked onto the cost of your sub. Will our now $6.89 or $7.89 footlong radically upset demand curves? I don't know the price elasticity of subway. Most likely yes. A certain percentage of $5.89 customers stop being customers at $6.89 or $7.89. And reduced demand loses sales etc. etc. etc.  All of these things are correct and a simplification I made from the reality of subway economics. But if we go through all of those improvements to our model now we have to include another much more difficult enhancement, which is: what is the total economic benefit to giving all of the workers in our subway economy a $5/ hr raise? The tomato slicer, the sub artist the guy who delivers the turkey, the kid who _feeds_ the turkeys. All of these people have their raise paid for by the $2 bump in the price of a footlong. Now they in turn can (more readily afford to) eat a footlong turkey sandwich each day instead of the sad bologna depresswich they brought from home. My central premise remains unchanged, no matter how much you want to quibble over the validity of my ELi5 simplifications: raising wages does impact prices of goods and services, but it is much less than the _naysayers_ would have you believe. Depending on who you listen to, a $0.50 / hr bump to the minimum wage would radically change consumer behavior and would be the death knell to our economy. Not true.
The cost to society, particularly where there is social health care, out weighs the tax benefits
True. If you lend me $1000 for a year at a rate of 5% interest per year (for the sake of simplicity, we'll ignore the issue of compounding), then that means that after one year, I have to pay you back the original $1000 plus 5% - that is, I have to pay you back $1050. Interest is mainly compensation for risk. There's a risk that I might not be able to pay you back all - or even any! - of the $1000 when the year is up. If you lent me the money at zero interest, there would be a significant potential downside for you, and no upside. In other words, you would have no reason to lend me the money, unless I were a close relative, or your best friend, or had dirt on you, or something. But if you charge interest, now there's a potential upside for you that compensates for the potential downside of me not repaying the money. This is why, as a rule, the riskier the loan, the higher the rate of interest.  Interest is also compensation for the fact that you won't have easy access to the money for the year that you lend it to me. (This is called the "time value of money".)  Finally, interest is also compensation for the other thing you asked about - inflation.  Inflation is a rise in the general price level. 5% annual inflation means that prices of goods and services have, on the whole, risen by 5% in a year. If you lend me the $1000 at 5% interest, and I pay you back the full $1050, but there was also 5% inflation that year, then you've really gotten screwed, since now you need $1050 just to buy the same stuff that would have cost you $1000 last year. In practical terms, you've gained nothing - the effect is the same as if you'd lent the money at zero interest. This is why the expected rate of inflation generally gets incorporated into the interest rate. If you'd had a crystal ball and could see that there was going to be 5% inflation in the coming year, it would have been rational for you to charge me 10% interest instead of 5%, in order to cancel out the effect of the inflation.
A bubble os when an asset price goes through the roof because the price is based upon unrealistic market growth. So in this situation houses are more expensive because of a few things, shortage of homes on the market, pandemic concerns, private firms buying up entire neighborhoods and supply change issues. It is iffy to say if we are in a bubble but I personally believe we are.
There is some weird quirk where if your home is destroyed, you can get FEMA assistance and home insurance … but only if you rebuild IN THE SAME PLACE. If you choose to move you don’t get the $$. It puts people into a cycle of rebuilding in areas that are prone to natural disasters and climate change disasters.
Two types of income are traditionally hidden offshore: Unrecognized/illicit income:  ex drug money, Crypto gains, etc And Legit income for which you don’t want future passive income /capital gains to be taxed.
Inflation happens because it's built into our currency system. Banks release more and more money in the form of loans. The central banks try to control that to keep inflation at around 2% per year. So it's kinda a planned feature. They do it because if they don't they risk the opposite: deflation. Deflation is horrible for the economy because if prices decrease then putting all your money into your matress is a better investment than starting a business that can fail. Also people will postpone purchases. Why buy a car today when it is cheaper in a few days? Deflation escalates quickly because the more people hoard money the less money is in circulation wich increases it's value further (decreasing the prices) In short: we make Inflation on purpose to prevent a speculation bubble with money
A few points: - they will give the dealership money, not you.  It will all be handled at time of purchase.  The loan may be approved ahead of time, but it’s not like they just give you $20k and go have fun. -They hold the title of your car until the loan is paid off, meaning if you want to sell the car, their loan must be paid off in order to do so.  - depending on your credit, and if the car is new or used, dealership loans may be preferable to a bank (no bank is giving 0% interest on a new vehicle).   - the biggest things to watch out for are early payoff fees (if I pay my car off completely two months after purchasing it, is there any additional cost? I shouldn’t be paying all the interest that I would have paid?) and any other fees (how bad are late fees, etc).  Most reputable banks do not have early payoff fees.  Some offers through dealerships do.
The Fed Funds rate is the basic rate of interest paid by any customer of the government’s central bank. All banks borrow money in some way from the government. This borrowed money is sometimes used to provide the funds for customers to maybe buy a house. So there is a cost to the bank to lend money to a customer as the bank is being charged interest. Another form of money for a bank is from other customer deposits. Those deposit holders also expect interest. So again it costs the bank money to lend to a mortgage holder. They expect more interest if the Fed raises its base rates.  So in both cases the cost of borrowing rises to the bank to lend to the mortgagee. You pay a higher interest rate than to cost to the bank of borrowing from the Fed. Same thing on customer deposit interest rates which are always lower than lending rates. This is the net interest margin which for a retail bank is the most common money maker. This margin of profit is used to cover operating expenses such as wages, pensions, real estate etc.  So basically if the Fed raises rates, banks have an increased cost of funds and that gets pushed to the customer via higher interest rates.  In times of Very low Fed rates such as recent times, that margin that I mentioned is really hard to maintain. Banks can’t justify charging customers high interest when rates are low and in turn they can’t pay much interest to deposit holders but typically they have to pay something to attract the deposit. They can’t charge interest to hold peoples’ deposits.
Well, the Infrastructure bill is hundreds of pages, so I don't know exactly what you are referring to, but "net free equity" is a financial calculation.  If you have a project, say building a toll road, then when the road is half built it's considered to have some "revenue value" even though that hasn't been realized because nobody is driving on it.  When the road is completed, this "value" will be the revenue that the road generates every year.  By considering this value to grow incrementally as the road is built, you avoid odd accounting things, like the last day of work producing some enormous value "magically". If it takes $100 to build the road, half way through you've spent $50, but perhaps accumulated $40 of this "value", so while you only have $50 left of the budget for the road, you have $90 of "free equity" which could be used for building other roads. In the end if it costs $100 to build a road that's worth $80, then the road is an investment.  This could be a good thing, and government would be willing to invest $20.  What the government doesn't want to do is invest $100 and then give somebody a "free road worth $80".  This is an accounting scheme that makes the government's investment (which typically doesn't include this "free equity") more accurately represented in the financials.
No there is no net benefit. Either the company donates in the name of the customer, which is rare and provides no tax deduction, or they donate in their name but must claim the income too. This results in not net gain or loss.
It makes money more expensive to borrow and more profitable to save.  This reduces spending, shrinking the demand side of the force creating inflation.
Imagine you wanted to buy a painting hanging in a gallery. A guy says to you "I'll sell you this piece of paper. The paper says on it that whoever holds this paper owns the third painting from the left in room 303 of the gallery, which is the one you want." You agree, and give him the money and he gives you paper. Now you have a piece of paper that says you own the painting! Hurray! However, you aren't allowed to do anything with the painting that is actually hanging in the gallery. Also, there is no guarantee that the guy who gave you the paper owned the painting in the first place. And the gallery might switch which painting is in that room so your paper points to the wrong painting, or the gallery might shut down altogether. And creating that piece of paper also required burning down 80 acres of rainforest. Anyways, NFTs are exactly like that, but digital and cool. Potentially, they could be useful, but so far, people have just sold them to each other in hopes they'll be able to sell them for more later.
Because tax organizations and companies lobby in congress to prevent bills from being passed that would enable this.
The US is paying it. “Owning someone’s debt” doesn’t mean you get to call that debt in whenever you want. If you take out a loan from someone you agree to a repayment schedule. Hopefully during that time you manage to turn that loan into more money and you come out richer.  That’s what the US does. One of the reasons people invest in US bonds is because they are particularly good about repaying debt. As for who owns it….mostly Americans Government bonds are US debt. A smaller portion is owned by foreign countries.
Hi, cheques after your bank gets them go through a "Clearing House". Here they will carry out the checks on whether the cheque is valid, and if money is available to honor it .
You gotta claim it as self employed tax form 1040 once you reach a certain amount  It’s income just like your regular job.
Theoretically, sure.  You could either deflate the currency through fiscal policy or simply revalue it and have people turn in their old dollars for new currency notes that have a lower value. Currency rebalancing is sometimes necessary in countries that have undergone hyperinflation - Venezuela replaced their useless Bolivar banknotes with Bolivar *Fuerte* notes that had the same value but weren’t denoted in thousands and millions. Actual deflationary policy is very rare, as the consequences are typically disastrous. Imagine if your “fixed” mortgage got more expensive every month, and every investor hoards their cash because it’s gaining value.  Nothing gets done, nobody spends, and people in debt are ruined.
As a business, you can call a bank and request a withdrawal of say £100 from your business account.  And then you can further specify in what denominations or in coins, IE so many in 2/1/.50/.20/.10/.05/.02/.01 etc which you would use for change in your store.  When you turn up they count out the coins etc into coin rolls and then give them to you in a sack for you to take away
Regardless of what country you live in there are going to be bank regulations that require the banks to have a certain amount of cash in their vaults at 5pm every day (or whatever the close of business is in your country).  That amount of money changes based on how much money their customers have deposited with them.  So if you transfer $100 out of your account, then your bank needs to hold a bit less cash as the end of the day.  Conversely, if someone transfers $100 into your account then the bank needs a bit more cash. Historically, this incentivized banks to retain a long delay on funds transfers long after it was possible to electronically transfer money instantly.  By keeping this delay, a bank's record books were essentially several days behind.   So if I initiate a transfer of $100 into your account on Monday, but the transaction won't process until 5pm Thursday, then both of our banks have 2-3 days to make sure that they'll have enough cash on hand as a result of that transaction. If you're transferring money within the same bank then there isn't any magic that needs to happen, its just a matter of the bank being willing to run the transfer instantly.  (So if you use Bank A and you transfer money to your friend who also uses Bank A, that's just a matter of internal bank policy as to how fast the money moves). For interbank transfers, apps like OSKO work because your bank has set aside a fund of extra money that it can pull from, if necessary, at the end of the day to balance the OSKO transactions.  Other instant pay apps, like Zelle, work the same way.   The reason that this got started is mostly because of how cheap money is right now.  In all likelihood the bank wasn't going to earn much, if anything, on that money anyways and the money is much more valuable being used to "fund" a perk that most customers consider to be mandatory.  Typically these apps have transaction limits in place to keep the amount of money being sent through them manageable. Checks still take time to clear because they're processed through an archaic payment system that is usually run by your country's government.  The time that it takes a check to process through this system is often set by legislation or administrative policy and there just isn't much that can be done unless your government decides to speed up check processing.  Banks like using the check processing systems available to them when large amounts of money are being sent.  Again, the delay built into those systems helps banks deal with the kinds of large transactions that checks continue to be used for. Banks also typically let you wire any amount of money instantly, though you have to pay for the service.  That payment is, in large part, designed to help offset impact that the transfer will have on the bank's end of day cash requirements.
There's no one factor. Some reasons: Interest rates are low enough that banks are happy to lend much larger amounts of money relative to people's income than historically. 5 times salary is not unnusal. Since people have access to more money via borrowing, in competitive housing markets prices rise rapidly as people try to outcompete each other. Increasing house prices can push up rental prices - with banks (reasonably) requiring the same percentage deposits, those who are currently renting are unable to build up enough savings for a deposit even though they could afford the mortgage. There's an impact of not the right housing - luxury homes are far far more profitable for developers, and there's an army of people out there who've ridden the wave of increasing house prices who can now comfortably afford the deposit on these luxury homes. Increasing house prices are viewed as a good investment - there's never been a housing crash in recent history that's not been recovered within a few years. People investing in houses (landlords) increases demand, pushing up prices, making it appear an even better investment, pushing up prices. Houses are one of the few investments where the bank will lend you money to make the investment. There are a lot of people who can borrow a few 100k to buy a rental property. The bank would laugh at you if you wanted to borrow a few 100k to invest in the stock market. Many landlords aren't able to make much money off rent, that's not particularly easy since it's a competitive market, however they make money off the rise in house prices.  Cities are pretty saturated with people, there's a demand for housing but nowhere to build more. Most countries with high house prices have no housing shortage - they just have a shortage of houses where people most want to live. Perhaps remote working will balance this one out. (Although in the UK, this has just caused a surge in house prices in rural areas as many have fled the cities).
We like being able to live inside of buildings and eat food every day. Those things cost money, and working is the most accessable way to get money.
Income you continue receive after you have completed the specific job that produced the income. Most common example is royalties.  You write a song and agree to get paid $X to sell it, plus Y% of any future sales.  The Y% is residual income, because you keep earning it long after the original sale of the song. It can **also** mean income an individual has left after all personal debts and expenses are paid in personal finance. Residual income is the level used to help figure out the creditworthiness of a potential borrower.  So if a lender is asking for your residual income, they want to know your salary minus all of your know debt (student loan payments, car note, etc.)
Technically the bank (or company) you invest in uses your money as capital to fund its business. So the bank or company pays you a small amount for that service. That's how it was explained to me as a kid when I first got a savings account. Similarly, but at a higher rate, when the bank lends you money, you pay them interest for using their money.  I may be totally off but it's how I remember it being explained when I was probably a bit older than 5...
Think of the debt ceiling as the US Government's credit card limit.  They can only borrow up to that point.  It's raised by congress passing a bill raising it, and the President signing it.
Inflation is the big issue here.  Things are only valuable if they are rare. Let's say that I have a special autographed copy of the first Percy Jackson book. There's only 12 of them in the whole world! Those books are rare and valuable, people are willing to spend a lot of money to own one of those twelve signed copies! That book is worth $1000!  But then, we learn that Rick Riordan, the writer of Percy Jackson, had a box filled with 500 more copies of that book he had autographed. Now, instead of only 12 copies, there's 512. People aren't as willing to spend $1000 on my copy. They might only spend $40 for it. Now that there's more copies, my single book isn't as valuable anymore.  Money sort of works the same way. It's hard to think about it that way, because we think that money is set in stone. But basically, if we make a lot more money, the value of the money we make goes down. Lots of countries have tried this, to just make more money, and the end result ends up hurting their finances. Now a bottle of milk might go from costing $3 to costing $300,000.  &#x200B; The real issue you're going for is "why don't we just fix the problems?" and part of it is that we'd have to completely change how we run our world to do so, and a lot of people don't want to do that.
The ESM isn't actually an EU institution, but an international one. It offers financial assistance only to countries that use the euro, not EU members who do not. Its purpose is to stop contagion spreading throughout the entire eurozone, should one country suffer a financial crisis.
Define normal person. If you have been saving up for a while and have been in a high salary career that whole time, it may be worth setting up a new business in the Caymans or where have you, but the advantages you will see would still be slim, since you are not wealthy in the same sense as the people we hear about. You’d have to make regular “investments” in your business and there would be a bit of overhead in at least your time to keep it up with Cayman regs.
It covers a slightly wider area than simply paying off a loan (according to the original terms) Example: A borrows $100 from B and agrees to pay $120 back in 2 years. After year 1, A repurchases the debt from B perhaps for less than $120. This is, of course, a repayment but it also was an action that might not originally be contemplated according to the term of the original loan.  Loans (major ones) are complicated contracts. There are terms that allow for early redemption etc. For example a company might issue 10 year bonds @ 10% interest rate with repurchase rights. If the company can subsequently borrow for 5% (say from a bank loan), it might decide to borrow at the lower rate and repurchase some or all the 10% bonds from the open market to reduce their interest expense.
In the US, there are 3 bureaus (Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian) that receive reports on your activity from banks, credit card companies, loan companies, utility companies, etc.  The credit bureaus take the information in these reports and calculate a number between 300 and 850 that is a quick indicator of how credit-worthy you are. For example, if you have a credit card that you use regularly and pay off each month and own a house and you haven't missed any payments in the last several years, you'll have a high score.  That will make it easier to get another loan because lenders will see lending to you as less risky.
The situation is way more complex then your question makes it sound. Firstly Africa is a huge entire continent. So finding extreme poverty, hunger and violent conflicts some where on the continent is not surprising. Similar to how you find all of these in North America as well. But there are also areas of wealth, growth and industry in Africa as well. It is just that these are tens of thousands of miles apart. That being said Africa is on average poorer then the other continents. And this is mostly due to centuries of exploitation by big empires. The decolonization of Africa did not really start making an effect until the 60s and even then it was just replaced by agents of the superpowers using African countries as theaters of their proxy wars. And all thoughout this period we have had big external power trying to divide and conquer the African countries, splitting up nations and putting them against eath other so they could not rise against their supressors. But now they are not conquered, just divided. So in addition to the huge material and humanitarian exploitation the countries are also ravished from internal racial, cultural, political and religious conflicts created by these powers. And you can not solve poverty and hunger unless you are able to build and maintain the infrastructure needed to prodce food and goods needed by the population.
In general for loans, forgiveness means that the loan is canceled and you don't owe that money anymore. In the context of student loans this means that the "forgiveness amount" is the amount that you won't have to pay.
Well, it doesn't work on your average mom and dads shop. But large companies like a bank usually operate globally, even if their origins an global HQ isn't in the US, they will have business there. So their options are to either pay the fine or get out of the US market. Most opt for the first option, but you will see companies threatening to leave if legislators for example want to introduce more regulation. edit: found the subsidiary. They're called Commerz Markets LLC, based in NYC. https://www.worldwide.commerzbank.com/en/home/inhalte/niederlassungsseite_5555.jsp
Let's say you are in 4th grade and sell candy bars. If you have 20 classmates and half of them like candy, your total market is 10 kids.  Now, you sell each bar for $1 and there's 10 potential clients. Your market is $10.  Your friends like candy so much that they buy two bars per day, so $10 x 2 = $20. This is what you are selling daily: $20.  Now, there's about 180 school days per year, so your market is $20 x 180 = $3600. Your local market is worth $3600 yearly. You have to realize that there are 87.500 elementary schools in the US, and that there are kids selling candy bars in every 4th grade, so. 87.500 x $3600/yr = $315M $315M is the total market value for the 4th grade candy bar industry.  Now, there are several markets per industry. Here we are assuming that there is only one product in this industry.  Most industries are more complicated, have several competitors and have more products. Now you can repeat this process for the electric car industry. With some sophisticated analysis you can know how many people are currently willing to buy one, and can forecast the future trends regarding prices and willingness to buy. Like so, you can estimate how much an industry will be worth.
Bonds are like loans, where an investor lends money to a government or company in return for interest payments. So one might buy a 10-year bond that pays 5% interest annually. But let's say 5 years later, the investor wants to invest elsewhere, or somebody wants to move money from stocks into bonds. The bond markets are where bond holders can sell on the secondary market to other investors, and investors looking to buy bonds can do so other than directly buying at time of issue. Prices of bonds fluctuate based on interest rate it pays relative to prevailing interest rate, to bring the effective rate in line with current rates relative to risk. So bonds with interest rates lower than current rates would sell at a discount to face value while bonds with higher interest rates would sell at a premium.
A lot of money will draw attention.  So if someone wants to give you a lot of money, it needs to be for something legal.  You could give them something worthless and have them give you a lot of money for it.  But for that to work, the value of the thing needs to be subjective.  Otherwise it would be obvious what you're doing.  The value of art is subjective, so it makes a great way to launder money.
There is.  For example, Humulog is available as a generic called insulin lispro.  But it's a very recent generic.   The issue is that when a company creates a new drug in the USA, a generic of it cannot be made for up to 20 years.  Humulog was first created in the late 90s, so it just came out of protections.   The other big complication to this, is that insulin technologies have changed drastically since the 90s.  In the 90s, the insulins that were available were very poor in controlling blood sugars.  Drug companies invested billions of dollars to create new and improved insulins.   Did you know that in the early 90s they were still using ground up animal pancreases for diabetics?  There wasn't a good artificial insulin available back then. In the 21st centuries advancements have been made in insulins.  They now have long acting insulins, medium acting insulins, highly concentrated insulins, etc.  These all give doctors and patients better control over a person's blood sugar, instead of just instant acting humulog. And since all of those have been invented recently, it will be many years before generics of them will be available.
EEZ's only work for countries that have a coastline. So no, Mongolia or Rwanda does not have an EEZ. And it is pretty simple, everything 200 miles from the coast is part of that country's EEZ, if you have an area where two countries EEZs overlap, then they are just divided at the midpoint. So if you had two countries separated by 300 nautical miles of ocean, they would both get an EEZ of 150 nautical miles, dividing it down the middle.
>I’ve never seen food shortage since the day I was born, so how is the food supply maintained so there are always food everywhere around?      Massive overproduction and (presumably at least where you live) sufficient infrastructure   If you need 1 of a thing each day but get 10 of it every day and have the opportunity to get 10 more each day at short notice in an emergency from the place next door then you can never really run out of that thing.
Most games that have micro-transactions are running on a different business model: the Free to Play or “Freemium” model.  These games are either free or have token costs ($1-5), and make their money from micro-transactions.   Other models charge customers a higher upfront cost and make most of their money from just the initial game sales.   Depending on how you game, you might get the impression that one model is dominant, but it isn’t.  FTP/Freemium games dominate the mobile market, and the other model dominates console/PC gaming.  They’re both viable.
During the past half a century more and more manufacturers have switched to just in time logistics. The concept is that instead of having a huge warehouse that keep ample stock of all the inputs to the factory as well as a nice stock of outputs from your factory you make sure that the inputs arrive just in time for when you need it and that the output is manufactured just in time for it to get shipped to the next factory. There are many advantages to this such as shorter turnaround time, not having to pay for goods that are just sitting in a warehouse and so forth. However JIT logistics only work when you are able to predict the supply and demand for the future. If you put in an order for a new webcam because you old one broke then it would be too slow to start ordering cobolt ore from congo which needs to be processed and shipped all over the world to make your webcam. The companies need to predict that someone is going to buy the webcam around that time and make sure it is already in stock when you place the order, or at least close to the end of the supply chain. But the problem the last year and a half is that global supply and demand have been fluctuating too much for anyone to predict it. And the entire global logistics system is so finely tuned for profit that even a tiny issue will cause global shortages.
What you're talking about is generally referred to as the 'Labor Theory of Value', which, at its root, is the idea that objects derive value from the 'socially necessary' labor that was put into its construction. Under this model, the inherent 'natural' value of something (lets say, a gallon of water) plus the labor put into producing it (bottling a ballon of water), produces some approximation of the value of the result (a gallon bottle of water). This is not necessarily the price of the thing, however, since Marx himself dives into something he termed the 'transformation problem', of how valuations of things translate to market prices, and, on the flip side, how the wages paid to yield labor does not necessarily align with the true value of the labor itself when applied to transforming a good. This is about as far as you can go without it going super super deep into general theories of value and prices, which is outside the scope of ELI5, but suffice to say that this model of valuation is, at *best*, controversial.
A stock's *price* is objective (though constantly changing during trading hours). A stock's *value* is subjective, something determined by each individual person based on a number of things, including its price but also how much one likes a company, its products or services, its industry, its CEO, its policies, its strategies, etc. When someone says a stock is overvalued, they're giving an opinion. They're saying they feel that the average value most people are assigning to the stock is too high, and so people are buying it at a price that is above what its "true" value is ("true" to the person giving their opinion). If a stock truly is overvalued, then its price likely to eventually go down as the value most people assign to it adjusts downward.
The department of education will give money to the state departments of education which will give money to schools to reduce the tuition they charge for pre-K.  Many states currently pay for 3hours/day of pre-K, and this will give them the money to fund these programs for a full day with lunch.
What it actually is: simply a meeting of the World Economic Fair, a pretty by-the-books conference. The main goal is simply to discuss changes that can be made for the betterment of society, meet to negotiate and plan for how to do this, and so on. What the conspiracy theorists think it is: using COVID as a backdrop, it's a change for these powerful elites, intellectuals, and privileged individuals to get together and formulate plans to gain more power--usually by pretending to be doing it for the "common good" but in reality by consolidating power. This really isn't new. Every decade or so there's a new flavor of "powerful elites meeting to undermine us all." It used to be the Council on Foreign Relations, or the Bilgerberger group, or the WTO. It *sort* of makes sense as to why conspiracy theorists latch on to these things--it's literally how "the elites" *would* consolidate their power, by meeting together and hatching secret plans all while pretending to hatch public anodyne plans. And history actually does have an awful lot of "sound good for the common man on paper but turns out to be terrible for them." Calling it "The Great Reset" was probably a bad move, since it intimates that we're going to erase the old stuff to replace it with new, and for conspiracy theorists the "old stuff" is not only working just fine, but taking it away would actively make them worse off. Just to be clear, though: there's nothing to these. There wasn't when it was the CFR, there isn't now. Don't fall for the conspiracy bullshit. Laugh at it from a distance, if you must.

Imagine you invented ice cream by inventing an ice cream maker. You goto a bank and ask for a loan because you actually don't have money for milk because you spent your initial money inventing the maker itself. Well the bank doesn't know what ice cream or an ice cream maker is, so they see no value in your business, thinking they will never get their loan back if it fails. Now imagine 10 people think your ice cream idea is brilliant and they will offer to give you money for you to buy milk. Because they did this and they believe in your product, they offer you money in exchange for shares, in the event that X amount of others will also enjoy icecream.  Since they took the early risk, they could either benefit from getting part of the profit, or sell the shares for more than they paid for them to someone who loves your new ice cream even more than they did  Now you have milk, and no debt (because the person bought shares, you don't owe them money, you physically sold them shares), and your business can continue. Banks don't typically give loans to startups, and larger companies don't want debt on their books ... For someone older than 5; there are multiple ways of doing shares, and multiple share classes, including ones that include debt or "convertible notes", different rights, etc. Not anyone can just buy (or sell) your shares
OSHA cares about safety and health. A union also fights for fair wages, paid leave and so on.
The artists, programmers, writers and the such all signed contracts saying "Everything I create while I work for this company belongs to that company." when they got hired. If you don't want your work to be owned by the company, you don't work for a company that does that. But since the majority of them work that way, you would have a very hard time getting a job.
I don't think this works for companies, but it does for individuals.   Let say you are Jeff Bezos.  You have 200 billion in stock in Amazon, but you make a small salary of like 80k (which is what is salary actually is).  But you want to buy a big house, you have two options: 1 - You can sell enough stock to have the cash to buy the house.  However, selling stock makes your income go up a lot.  And then you'd have to pay a lot of taxes on that profit of selling stock.  Lots of taxes. 2 - You can borrow money using the stock as collateral.  You allow the bank to put a lien on a portion of your stock, and they give you the money for the house.  Since you aren't selling the stock, there is no income, there is no tax burden involved. Anybody can do this IF they have assets for the bank to have a lien against.  Stocks.  Houses.  Etc.
Even the Black Friday sale prices you pay are more than the product costs to make and ship, with a few rare exceptions called loss leaders.  Black Friday focuses on volume of sales, so while the profit on an individual sale might be smaller than a sale at another time (this is debatable), the company makes up for it by selling MORE of that item.  If I can make a sandwich for $5 and I normally sell it for $10 I make $5 per sandwich and I sell 5 a day I net $25.  If on Black Friday I sell that same sandwich for $8 I only make $3 per sandwich but I sell 20, I’m making $60 profit, much more than a normal day.  Now in real life this is more complicated, but for ELI5 I think it’s good enough.
>Why is the real estate bubble in Europe and NA not bursting although in most areas the properties are even more overvalued than back in 2008?      Not every price increase is a bubble. You cannot *know* something is in a bubble. It can always just be the new "normal". If "the market correcting itself" for any type of commodity turns out to be "that commodity was undervalued significantly and will only keep growing in price" then waiting is the losing move.       If you wanted to buy into crypto some years ago but planned to wait for the ridiculous bubble prices of more than 1 thousand dollars per bitcoin to finally come down to a reasonable level of a couple of bucks... well, you'd still be waiting today.
If a price increase causes a restaurant to lose business, then the business may lower their prices to try to regain competitiveness within the market. Otherwise, it would be difficult to imagine a scenario where any business would want to lower prices permanently
When you're old you propably want to retire right? Working until you drop dead isn't what most people strife for. You need any form of financial support by then, and there are many ways to approach this depending on where you live. A pension is basically some kind of savings/insurance combination. You pay into it, they invest the money and agree to pay you out monthly once you reach a certain age. Thats usually more efficient than just hoarding the money because A: they invest it gaining some interest and B: it's independant of how long you live, how would you budget $300k when you're 70 and could live anything between 5 and 30 more years?
The money you get from selling your old house will help you pay off its mortgage. E.g., if you had $200,000 left to pay on your mortgage, it's no problem if you manage to sell the house for $250,000. That gives you enough money to pay off your mortgage and still leaves you with $50,000 to put toward the purchase of a new house.
One thing to know about the the unemployment rate is that it’s defined as “people who have a job divided by people who want a job” … if a person without a job isn’t actively seeking one then they are considered to have dropped out of the labor pool and don’t count against the unemployment rate. So it’s possible for there to be an increase in people choosing not to have a job without the unemployment rate going up.
One of the main things people don't understand about national debt is that most of it is owed to various entities inside the country itself. If you have money to invest, one of the things you can do is buy government bonds.  If you do this, the government owes you that money back (in say 1, 10, or 30 years) and they will pay your interest in the meantime.  You have no corresponding debt to the government.  It all debt were canceled, you would lose that money.
Because they trade in actual instruments that have value - shares of companies and debt. Owning a share gives you a stake in ownership of a a company, claim on their profits and assets. Debt gives you a financial claim to be repaid at some point in the future with interest. Financial markets trade in these claims, through a variety of instruments but unlike Ponzi schemes the underlying claims produce value - companies sell goods and services and generate profit.
Bluetooth is not a company but a technology. There is a Bluetooth Special Intrest Group which manages the Bluetooth standard but this is a non-for-profit company with 35,000 member organizations. They do not sell anything to anyone and does not make any profits. It is just a place for the device manufacturers to make sure their devices are compatible with each other and that the consumer knows that their devices will work with each other. In fact standards like Bluetooth helps reduce the impact of monopolies as consumers are much more free to choose technologies from different vendors.
Because it's the restaurant business model.       In a fast food restaurant like McDonalds, you usually make a transaction, which you pay for up front.       In a traditional restaurant, people usually constantly increase the bill by ordering more drinks, desserts, etc. If you paid in advance, you would probably feel less incentive to order more later.
This question is borderline against the sub rule #4 so I'll to it properly and then in the way you asked. Laypeople: The 2008 financial crisis was caused by banks lending to people that could not afford the loans they were signing up for. This 'subprime lending' ended up leading to an excessive amount of foreclosures in 2006-2007. This impacted the entire economy of the USA because the hedge funds, and other investing portfolios/banks/etc. were essentially trading debt between themselves for profit by playing the 'futures' (I might have that part wrong). So as the increase of foreclosures lead to higher and higher losses the various entities investing in the mortgages started losing excessive amounts of money and the domino effect lead to a massive recession and drastic losses in property value which lead more people to be 'upside-down' in their mortgages which lead to more foreclosures. Also the domino effect I mentioned before lead to layoffs throughout the economy which further exacerbated the issue. For an actual 5 year old: Banks have a bunch of pretend money that they loan to people to pay for houses. They judge how much a person can barrow by how much they make and how much debt they already have. Now, the banks were lending to people that had no business barrowing as much as they were and had no hope of actually paying back the loan. The banks and the other people that were lending the money to make money through interest started losing a LOT of money because the people weren't able to pay it back. All these people losing money basically control the economy and because of this as they lost money the economy crashed.
Buyers aren't always sellers (they may be buying a second house, for example). And sellers aren't always buyers (they may be moving into a rental, for example). Furthermore, markets are local. So a buyer/seller in one market might not necessarily be a seller/buyer in that same market.
We can rearrange existing natural resources into a more useful configuration and discover new *ideas* that make it eaiser to do stuff.   A bunch of rocks become concrete for a building. A building is worth way more than a bunch of rocks. That's new wealth.   Someone discovers how to build a computer. That's new wealth. Someone else figures out how to build computers with less material. That's new wealth.
This is an economic issue rather than a scientific issue so it will depend where you live, but basically more people want processed sugar, which increased the demand, which increased the number of suppliers willing to sell it, which decreased the price. In order for a plant to remain profitable when selling an item with low profit like processed sugar they need to sell a lot of it. For base ingredients, since less is sold the profit margins need to be higher to achieve a similar revenue. There are also certain countries that restrict what parts can grow "raw sugar" and may require specific designation.
Well, any of the citizens that work for the government may not get paid on time, even if they're in critical positions and still have to go into work (they do actually get paid, just not until the shutdown is over). An exception is service members often get paid anyway, whether through military friendly banks or emergency authorizations to fund just the service members until the shutdown is over.   Beyond that, any government services that aren't critical won't be open/available, things like national museums, parks, and other such services. USPS will still run though, without pay (till the shutdown is over), for example.
For most of history, there wasn't that much difference between most region of the world. Great civilizations rose and felt, bringing stability and wealth to different region throughout history. China was often one of the richest region of the world, the Middle East was a power house between the Ancient World and Islamic Golden Age, and Africa was known for several rich Kings, etc. America was usually behind in term of wealth. Why it was the case is a bit complicated. Being separated by an Ocean limit the spread of trade and knowledge (trade between Europe, Middle-East, Asia and North/East Africa was important), but there is also a theory about the lack of tameable work animal in America, which limited greatly the work capability of American tribes. Animal work in the field mean some people could do other things than food production, which lead to more trader, artisan, craftsmen, etc. It's really only because of the industrial revolution that Europe was able to get in front of the rest of the world in term of technology and wealth. According to Maddison (a British economic Historian), in 1600, China and India had 51.4% of the world GDP (PPP), but at that point in time only had 47.5% of the population, meaning they were not only big, but richer than the world average. In 1600, India had 22.7% of the World GDP (PPP), by 1820 it was 16.1%, by 1870 it was 12.2%. India wasn't getting poorer, their economic growth was 22.7% in the 16th century, and 21% in the 18th century. The difference was that the economic growth of Europe was just too big to keep up. Similar story with the rest of the world. So the question really is why the Industrial Revolution happened in England instead of somewhere else and why remained concentrated in Europe. That's again a really difficult questions to answer. The is a lot of factor that made the industrial revolution happen in England, the agricultural revolution of the 17th-19th century, a large and easy access to coal, the political climate, etc.  Once this started, Europe had the technology and wealth to spread its power across the world through colonization. Places where European settled the most (America, Australia, New Zealand, etc) become rich, the places that were not settle by European but instead become exploitable colonies didn't received the technology and knew how needed to kick start an Industrial Revolution until several centuries later. At that point, their delay in economic growth was just too big leaving Europe and places they settled in ahead.
Prices can go down if demand goes up, but that also means that supply has to go up, too.  The harder it is to get something that people want, the more people are willing to pay for that thing.
They go up and down in price to pay for the future oil they will receive, not what they are selling at the moment, and also due to supply and demand.   Here is a good example. You sell rubber balls.  Every day you go in with $20 bucks, but $20 bucks worth of rubber balls, then go out and sell them at a park for $30.  One day your supplier tells you that starting the next day, the cost of them are going to go up to $30.  So you buy your $20 worth of balls, but know the next day they are going to cost more and you'll need to have the money to pay for them, but also you need your $10 profit to pay your bills.  If you only charged $30 (your normal) for that day, then you would not have enough money to pay your bills and get the balls the next day.  So you raise your price to $40.  So your profit for that day is $20, but now you have the $30 to carry to the next day to pay them for the increased price in balls. Going down works a little differently.  Gas stations don't just lower their prices as quickly as oil goes down.  They lower the prices slowly to take advantage of making more profit.
In English, at least, it's because English uses the Latin alphabet (plus J V and W, which naturally developed from existing Latin letters). The Latin alphabet fit the Latin language pretty well, but it's missing letters for various sounds found in other languages, including English. Some languages which use the Latin alphabet use diacritics to extend the alphabet; Czech and Lithuanian are examples of this approach. Why some languages end up extending/modifying the alphabet, while others use digraphs, I don't know. It's definitely an interesting question, though!
It means "son of". Just like English names often end in -son, Scottish names often start with Mc-, Irish names often start with O'-, Spanish names often end in -ez, Arabic names often start with ibn or bin, etc..
“afaik /p/ cannot suddenly appear from nowhere.” Why couldn’t *-p have been a suffix? We may or may not be able to reconstruct their meanings, but both PIE, PS, PAA etc. are full of such monoconsonantal suffixes.  I agree that the PS word is probably inherited, based on many similar words in PAA. For that matter PIE shares an enormous amount of cognates with PAA (compare for example PIE *h₂ówis “sheep” to PAA *ʕaw “goat/sheep”; or PIE *men- “to stay, remain” to PAA *mun “to be, remain”).
Haha, the link to the Finnish page is my master's thesis. My advisor and I wrote a more general defense of it, [published in the first volume of Brill's International Journal of Eurasian Linguistics](https://brill.com/view/journals/jeal/1/1/article-p46_4.xml). I probably don't have the authority to freely share that, but I can send you an initial revision when I'm on my computer later. In short, there are some very compelling reasons to accept the original front/back hypothesis.
Here's a [post](https://www.englishspeechservices.com/blog/morgen-a-suitable-case-for-treatment/) by Geoff Lindsey that mentions exactly this. >Also to be heard in recordings of classic RP is a version still more distinct from today’s LOT, namely ɑ, i.e. low, unrounded and short (ie differing from the PALM vowel only in length). So yeah.
Another post which presents incendiary but unattributed opinions, relayed by some fellow student, which may or may not be what the unnamed scholars said, and seeming to refer to controversies that may be current or may instead have faded decades ago.
It’s weird, it shouldn’t have a “c” there, as there wasn’t even one present in the middle english “aqueinten.” My best guess is that someone felt like english spelling should reflect Latin’s more directly, so they decided that we should add the “c” back in, since “acquaint” is derived from the latin “accognitāre,” which has a “c.” I guess they also didn’t feel like taking the “q” out with it, since maybe they thought that’d be _too_ drastic. Perhaps they felt that it should follow words like “acquire” in their spelling, since their latin and middle english roots both contained a “cq” already, so it’s less of a mystery why “acquire” has a “cq” cluster — it’s because Latin did.
The carbohydrate prefixes up to four simply do not drive from Greek. Once they run out of creative stems they resorted to "enumerating" then and took the Greek prefixes.
I think you are underestimating the difficulty of coming up with an original research topic on a language as well-studied as Japanese.  There are certainly unanswered questions, but if you have to learn about them on Reddit it will be a while (realistically, years) until you have the background and resources necessary to contribute something original to those discussions.
Your program will be hyper tailored to Spanish, with perhaps some stuff in other romance languages. Oftentimes, they will be more focused on applied linguistics, but that doesn't mean they can't or won't have solid theoretical offerings. A school's Spanish literature department isn't any better or worse because of the presence of a world literature program for the same reason.
I am a curious as to how one could conclude there was "less imperialism" when comparing two languages belonging to two of the largest empires ever (UK and Spain).   Am I missing something here?
They’re also dropped in French and Spanish though. It’s just spelled more conservatively to reflect historical latin roots.
I first heard Persian from Iranian foreign students during my first year in college, I've heard it numerous times since then, but I still have the same opinion. It sounds soft and delicate to my ears, easily beats any of the more popular languages (i.e. French, Japanese, etc.) for me. Arabic sounds rough, not particularly bad, just harsh-sounding. Also, I'm sorry, the song you posted is wack. lol
French was likely base 20 at some point, as evidenced by its numbers greater than 60 - 70="soixante-dix" (sixty-ten), and 90 - "quatre-vingt-dix" (4-20s and 10).
I don't know what institution this might be, but in general it's nonsense.  Yes, phonetics is different from other core domains in linguistics because it is an 'etic' discipline and \*highly\* empirical - it's certainly not the case that phoneticians and linguists differ in practice but not in theory: they are different domains.  I don't think that there is any serious conflict on the discipline level between phoneticians and phonologists either - they seem to get along pretty well. Are you \*sure\* you aren't confusing phonetics with philology?   There would be a case to be made about conflict between philologists and linguists in \*some\* respects and some cases.
Wow that last phoneme is pretty rare. Perhaps it was loaned. Do you mind reposting your results in text? I can't read the last phoneme. Is it ɫ?

prepositions ?
You'd actually be surprised. I speak more languages that don't use gendered speech than I do those that do, but even between French, Spanish, and Italian, there are many nouns that don't share the same gender and they are all derived from Latin.  This isn't necessarily root language based so much as it is culture based. Even among the Germanic languages or the Nordic languages, they cannot agree upon which should be neuter.  The only ones that actually agree at all are the ones that don't use gendered declension like English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
As a linguist who has studied the Austronesian focus system I think it is a thing of beauty. And it is interesting that native speakers don't need to know all this (I mean on an intellectual level I know that).  Do you  believe it would be useful to teach in more depth? AFAIK, all (or most) Filipino languages have a fully fledged Austronesian focus system, right?
Native speaker and linguistics student. So far as I know friendship only refers the relationship between friends.  Because English is a germanic language and compounds are common you could feasibly imply that it was a ship for friends, or a ship that was a friends. But that would be poetic or or a pun, requiring the relevant context, so if it was me I'd say monosemantic.
How readable your writing is depends a lot on who’s meant to be reading it.
In Spanish, sometimes gender is swapped, sometimes it isn't.  It's a personal/artistic choice. There are several examples of both.  Sometimes the singer acts as a narrator, so even if the story is in first person, it doesn't matter if the genders don't match. Sometimes the singer performs the song "in character" and so, gender is made to agree with the singer.
[Sound symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_symbolism), maybe? The specific kind that would be involved in your examples would be iconism, I think.
I recommend looking at specific constructions in the novel and see how they translate. For example, you could highlight whenever the novel describes the location of an object, and see how the languages differ in their extension of certain spatial relators.
Sounds quite interesting. Can you give some examples?
\>In American English, /ɾ/ corresponds to /t/ or /d/. Speakers of my native language, which is Portuguese, have /ɾ/ as a rhotic phoneme, always spelled r. I knew a girl from Brazil whose name was Moara; she taught us Americans how to say her name perfectly by pronouncing it as if it was spelled Moada or Moata.
There are over seven thousand languages in the world, most of which are underdocumented, so such a book for *all* languages is quite unrealistic. If you want a decent introduction to *some* languages, though, I'd suggest *The World's Major Languages*, edited by Bernard Comrie.

> can we say the shape of the mouth at the end of all consonants implies a certain subset of vowels (or other consonants even) must follow to some degree? I don't think you're right on the mark, but it's closer to this. A consonant and a following or preceding vowel are not discrete points, but smooth transitions between the two as the tongue or other parts move between positions. As a result, vowels "warp" next to consonants during the transition between one and the other. The [i]-like sound that happens as you transition from the Mandarin <x q j> set is just that transition happening, because the tongue is placed in an [i]-like position for the consonant so transitions from there. There are similar transitions for sounds like [p t k], just generally less noticeable. This warping of vowels during the transition is one of the acoustic cues, each point of articulation has different ones (and they become extremely important for unreleased stops, since there's no release burst acoustics).

There are no “objectively better or worse” grammars, morphologies, etc. All languages do the job of a language. However, some have less common features in their grammar, morphology, etc. Even commonly studied and widespread languages can have uncommon features: [θ] and [ð] (“th” in English) are actually rare phonemes among languages.

Apart from using Basque words for greetings (agur instead of adios)/thanks (eskerrik asko)/congratulations (Zorionak) and a couple other specifics (changing the spelling of some words from "Ch" to "TX" pinchos-pintxos and from k to c) there is no difference between the Spanish spoken in Zamora and Vitoria. One could mention the accent, which can be distinguished by locals, but for a southerner they'd both be "Northern accents". In facto both might struggle to get second and third conditionals right, and have certain laismo/loismo.  And Spanish dominance has been the norm for several centuries, so I wouldn't really say it's recent.
The air must be pushed underneath the tongue without going on top of it and must be strong enough to cause the underside of the tongue to vibrate against the lower lip. As far as I know this is impossible.

There are leaps here that are leading you astray. 1. Faithfulness does not preserve markedness. Faithfulness preserves similarity to the underlying representation. It has no bearing on markedness. If it did, we would not need to posit faithfulness constraints; everything could be described in terms of markedness constraints.  2. "since markedness constraints lower the amount of marked features" -- This is only true if markedness constraints outrank faithfulness constraints. Remember that OT constraints are violable, like traffic rules, where more egregious violations incur a greater penalty and some are prioritized for enforcement more than others. Markedness constraints can only decrease marked features if they occupy a higher ranking. Therefore, markedness can increase or decrease over time depending on how ranking proceeds. 3. "The way I see it, markedness and information are kind of synonymous here. " There is no reason to believe this. VC is a more marked syllable structure than CV. They are equal in how many possible syllables can be made from them. There is no difference in how they can be used to convey information. Markedness has nothing to do with information.
Yes, tons. Look at phonologies of Pacific Northwest languages, where most also distinguish /xʷ/ and /χʷ/. Some languages of that area that contrast at least /x/ and /χ/: Tlingit, Haida, Nisga'a, Gitxsan, Nuxalk, Haisla, Heiltsuk, Kwak'wala, Nuu-chah-nulth, Ditidaht, Makah, Quileute, Cowlitz, Chinook, Alsea, Mainland Halkomelem, Lillooet, Shuswap, Thompson, Columbia-Moses, Colville-Okanagan, Sahaptin, Nez Perce.
Parthian and Middle Persian coexisted, and were quite similar. Modern Persian evolved from Middle Persian, which is a Southwest Iranian language, and eventually subsumed Parthian, which probably has no *direct* descendants, but has left a significant stamp on languages within the Iranian cultural sphere, particularly Armenian, which might have more Parthian loan words than Modern Persian itself. A lot of what we know about Parthian comes through Armenian, not Persian.  So the direct answer is that Parthian lasted a bit longer in the Caucasus than in Iran itself, then died out without any direct descendants, but it left a huge mark on Armenian, and to a lesser degree, Persian.
Persian. Some persian words in Turkish are phonetically so well camouflaged that you would be surprised.
From my understanding, the issue with all caps is that ascenders and descenders help readers quickly parse words, and that information is missing with all-caps text. Style guides I have read discourage acronyms/initialisms without first tagging them with the full name/phrase because not all readers know what they stand for (and when they’re in all caps, you have the same ascender/descender issue). A search on “typography and linguistics” yields some academic papers on that subject, so it looks like people have been doing work in this area. Edit: typos
I'm not sure if there's a term for greetings specifically, but the term for phrases that are spoken more as part of common social acts than as any sort of transmission of actual information are called *phatic expressions*.

Would it be \[tʂ\] without the tie bar? I would use the "Wikipedia transcription": *czysta \[ˈt͡ʂɨsta\], trzysta \[ˈtʂˑɨsta\] / \[ˈtʂɨsta\].* Without tie bar or with this little point /ˑ/.
>In eastern Siberia, "Chukchi women's language differs from the Chukchi men's variety in a number of synchronically unpredictable ways, particularly with respect to an alternation between r and c/č. ... this alternation is nonarbitrary, originating from the asymmetric collapse of three cognate sets into two, such that in men's Chukchi *r and *d > r and *c > č, whereas in women's Chukchi *r > r and *d and *c > c."[11] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role_in_language#Asia
Generally a capital C is used as a placeholder to signal that a consonant goes there, but that the exact consonant is uncertain or the author does not wish to state it for whatever reason. Likewise, a capital V represents a given vowel. The hyphen that you see in reconstructions is typically used to signal a morpheme boundary. In this case, it could be that the author was uncertain if it should be  \*k or \*t or something else entirely, since we see different forms in surrounding contact languages.
seems reasonable to me. maybe a caveat is that the statistical learning stuff would be of scientific interest if it were being used to test hypotheses about the ways in which statistical learning is involved in the human capacity for language. surely there is good work like that. but it's hard to argue with chomsky that if the statistical techniques are being used with other goals (like trying to emulate training data for engineering purposes), it doesn't bear on questions about how language works in humans.
“Free variation” is close, although it a) doesn’t *just* refer to pronunciation, and b) sometimes refers specifically to variation produced by individual speakers. But one can easily say that multiple pronunciations are in free variation within some speech community.
Yeah - it is just because you are a native and the script is so deeply imbedded in your brain from years of education and use. Keep in mind that some of the Latin letters didn't originally make the sounds they make now. The Latin script has been adapted from language to language over a long period of time - its origins aren't even in an Indo-European language.

Many (not all) Latin masculine nouns, including many male names, end in "-us", but "Satan" *is not Latin.* It's the English name of a creature from Christian lore based on Jewish legends--a name which came to English from Hebrew via Latin and Greek, spelled in at least three different alphabets on its way to our language--alphabets that don't map neatly onto the alphabet we use today. So it's pointless to discuss how it "should" be spelled. "Correct" is not really a thing that linguists arbitrate. It *is* spelled S-a-t-a-n in English. That's the general consensus spelling in modern English, so that's as close as a "should" as you'll ever get.
First, I'd suggest the book 'Definiteness' by Lyons. Complete but accessible. Second, 'the articles are necessary to meaning' and 'articles are necessary to meaning' actually mean two separate things. The second is generic. The first refers to precise referents, they have already been introduced in the conversation or they are generally known. So the reference is not to any article but to precise ones. Let's say it binds the variable of the reference. Then this binding might be externalized according to the language; some languages have articles, some don't. But the feature 'definiteness' exists anyway.
Firstborn daughter would literally mean the first daughter born.  The Dakota Sioux language indicates firstborn or eldest daughter.  Edit: Jewish Passover traditions contradict this interpretation.

Where those words come from is [less clear](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5yRCm_VJN_8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA167&dq=etymology+jamaican+%22da%22+%22de%22&ots=m8N3-D5TBB&sig=2WIhclMOoBlqqEixd9X1sx6hDAc#v=onepage&q=etymology%20jamaican%20%22da%22%20%22de%22&f=false), though an English dialectal form *da* with the same meaning or even the word *there* are possible contenders. Note that it does not indicate future, but rather is a non-stative marker.
This is a false dichotomy. The era of creolization is over in most of the world where Creoles once formed and spread. Creolization would not be "becoming more and more local", and it's unclear what is ever meant by becoming "more Creole" or "less Creole". But no new Creole languages are forming anywhere in the English-speaking parts of the Third World. There is also seemingly an idea that decreolization would bring Creoles toward the US or UK norms. I'm not sure why you have that impression, but it is misguided. Decreolization [\(if the term itself is even useful\)](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/iulcwp/article/view/25994) would bring the Creole closer toward the lexifier with which it is in contact. In the Commonwealth Caribbean, that would be Caribbean English, not UK or US English.  But by and large, if any variants are being lost, they are more likely to come from basilectal varieties than acrolectal varieties. The presence of English remains strong and continues to exert similar force as it does in countries around the world where no Creole languages are spoken.
If you don't speak French, towards the end you'll still be able to hear some extracts of young native speakers in Valais speaking their patois.
Spanish has *nada* “nothing” being a direct descendant of a word that means “born”. Wiktionary says: > Inherited from Latin *(nūlla rēs) nāta* (literally “no born thing, not a thing born”), an extension of *nēmō nātus* (“not a soul”, literally “nobody born”). (In modern Spanish the participle of the verb *nacer* “to be born” is regular, *nacida*, so there's no homonymy.) Bracketing other parts of the same expression gives French *rien* and Catalan *res*, with the same meaning.
Mandarin is rhotic, but how much depends on your dialect. This rhoticity results in consonant deletion: 玩儿 wanr is pronounced war.  This rhoticity even affects the tones of some words 'photo' 照片儿 zhao4 pianr4 becomes zhao4 pianr1. This tonal change  even spread to non-rhotic variants of Mandarin in the form of zhao4 pian1
“Experience” comes from old English *experience*, which comes indirectly from Latin *experientia*. *experientia* was pronounced (roughly) “eks-peh-ree-en-tee-ah”. The e used to make an “eh” sound, not an “ee” sound. Over time the pronunciation shifted (which is what language does), but the spelling stayed the same.

Apologies have been studied in pragmatics as a type of speech act. Different cultural contexts elicit apologies. My hunch is that there’s not much semantic difference cross-culturally and there’s much more pragmatic difference regarding communicative situations as well as the appropriate schema/scenes/scripts/models (or whatever you call them, as there are way too many words for this concept). For example, say we’re speaking Japanese. If I were to drop a pen, and you picked it up for me, I would say “すみません” in response to you. すみません is often translated into American English as “I’m sorry” and “excuse me,” but here, it would be translated as “thank you” in order to be culturally appropriate in the American context. My Japanese professor said that both “I’m sorry” and “thank you” can functionally recognize that someone is doing something for you. In the case of dropping the pen, in the Japanese schema of the situation, it is appropriate to apologize for inconveniencing someone who picks up the pen for you. An American would say thank you for the exact same reason. This demonstrates that the meanings of the phrases hinges on context. I don’t know of any specifically good articles, but I googled “cross-cultural aplogogy study” and got a ton of hits!
There's [this two-volume work by Feng Shengli](https://www.routledge.com/Prosodic-Syntax-in-Chinese/Shengli/p/book/9780367730314) on how a wide range of syntactic facts about Mandarin Chinese have an interesting explanation in terms of phrasal phonology notions like the nuclear stress rule. Bear in mind that in many languages the influence of rhythm/metrical phonology on syntax might be nil... Chinese is certainly a special case in myriad ways.
I have three issues with DM: (1) it that it lacks (afaik) proper computational implementations, (2) analyses cannot be induced automatically from raw data, (3) there are no clear ways of integrating what we know about paradigm organization with it. An issue I have with practitioners of it is that they usually aren't interested in modeling whole systems, but rather very limited abstractions of whole systems. Ah example is Müller's analysis of Russian which only looks at 5 inflection clases and calls it a day. I actually like some features thought, like that it is completely postsyntactic.
Input, typing it is a pain.
This was really interesting, thanks for sharing!
Ease of learning does not necessarily track the closeness of genetic relationship between languages.  For example, English-speakers generally find Spanish an easier language to learn than German, even though German is more closely related.
I always recommend the collexification [database](https://clics.clld.org/) for this purpose.
These are answers for the US: 1. If you're a graduate student or faculty member, there are grants that you can apply for. These are still possible to get - many people still get them. The larger problem you will run into is the *lack of jobs* after graduate school. Most graduate students will not end up with a decent professional academic career. As a side note: You should not be applying to programs that do not fully fund you; tuition should not be an issue at all.  2. The problem with getting a job in order to support yourself so you can work in language documentation is that now you have a job. A PhD in linguistics isn't something that you do while you have a job. Whether you can work on documentation while holding down a job also depends, but if you're outside of academia, you won't have access to the same grants, institutional support, or networks. It's not *impossible,* but I don't want to give you the impression that it's *likely.* Most language documentation research is mostly done by academics or by people who are members of the communities themselves. 3. Most linguists do have theoretical questions that they're interested in. It's getting harder and harder make a name for yourself in US academia by writing descriptive grammars; there are big incentives to publish papers of "theoretical" importance. However, there are linguists who do a lot of documentation over their careers in addition their theoretical interests, or who focus on methods/tools etc for documentation. It's kind of a sad situation. There's not *no* support for documentation, but there's *less* support for it than there should be, and a lot of that lack of support is due to the structure of academia in the US itself (graduate school timelines, few jobs at the "top," publish or perish, etc).
Please do one on the name of the evening meal.
Functionally (in terms of grammar), it’s just omitting the particles and making the whole chunk into a noun = nominalization (名詞化). Or so I would assume (I‘m not sure if this counts as nominalization. I ditched morphology in undergrad.) The reader can’t really tell whether it’s 全国大会に出ます or 全国大会に出ました (i.e., the tense is omitted) + it will take some additional milliseconds for the reader to grasp the meaning (because it requires the reader to fill in the particles themselves).  But, it takes up less space in writing. As such, this sort of noun chunking is frequently observed in contexts where information needs to be spatially condensed. Newspaper headlines is one example.
Probably Taa, spoken in South Africa. Somewhere between 58 to 87 consonants, 20 to 31 vowels and 4 tones (the variation comes partly from an east vs west dialects). Quite a lot. Edit: maybe "dialects" isn't the right word, it's more like two mutually intelligible languages (and a bunch more langauges in the middle and around the side in this dialect continuum)
In the Berliner dialect, /g/ takes a fricative allophone [ɣ] after back vowels, and [j] after front vowels and approximants and word-initially.  Could this be what you’re observing?
> Secondly, what are the correct terms for all this stuff? Is there a specific name for verb conjugations that give the pronoun as part of the ending or for those that do not? The term usually used for this phenomenon is *agreement* - a verb *agrees* with one or more noun phrase arguments in its clause. There's also a technical distinction to be made between languages where the verb marking only appears when there's no full noun phrase argument, versus languages where a full noun phrase still cooccurs with the verb marking (as is the case in Latin, where third-person *ambulat* is valid both on its own as 'he/she/it walks' and in combination with full noun phrase subjects - e.g. *puella ambulat* 'the girl walks'). Technically only the second is really agreement; if a full noun phrase replaces the verb marker, the verb marker is probably better thought of as just a pronoun in its own right that happens to be stuck on to a verb. (Note that in colloquial French the reduced former pronouns in front of a verb *do* cooccur with coreferent full noun phrases, meaning that they've transitioned from being standalone pronouns to being true agreement prefixes.) > Are there special names for the languages themselves, denoting their verbal conjugation types? I don't think there are special terms for languages that have or lack this particular feature. I personally don't like terms of the format 'X language' very much though, since it feels kind of exoticising and a bit like it's reducing a whole language to just one notable property. > Are verbal conjugation endings all just called endings or are there different terms for whether that ending is capable of replacing a pronoun or not? They're usually called *affixes* (or *prefixes* or *suffixes* depending on where they go), or just *markers* (though not all markers are affixes). There are names for different types of markers depending on what they do - so for example the *-s* in English *walks* is a (third-person) subject agreement marker, while the *-ed* in English *walked* is a (past) tense marker. In paradigm-based languages like Latin, though, often you'll just talk about the given *form* for a particular combination of grammatical features. If a marker can't coocur with a full noun phrase, it's probably a 'clitic' pronoun. 'Clitic' is a term some people don't like because it's not super well defined, but in this case it means something that's structurally a separate word as far as the grammar is concerned, but within the sound system it behaves like it's a part of another word. You may also see the word *morpheme*, which is the technical term for 'any single unit of meaning that can't be broken into meaningful subparts'. (That definition technically includes lexical roots as well as grammatical function material, but usually people only think of grammatical function material when they think of the term *morpheme*. Of course, that distinction isn't always super clear, though!) > Firstly, is it more common for a language to need separate pronouns or are verbal conjugations with the pronouns as an ending more common? Of the 378 languages in the World Atlas of Language Structures's [sample](https://wals.info/feature/102A#2/18.0/149.2) for this particular property (kind of a small sample, but not surprising), a full 296 have verbs agree somehow with one or both of the core arguments in their clause. At least based on that data, which accords fairly well with the general impression I've gotten, languages with agreement are significantly more common than languages that lack it. > Are there other kinds of grammatical structures than those? Do all languages fall into one of two categories or are there other format? There are definitely other ways to do this besides an Indo-European style subject agreement system. Some parameters that can vary: * Some languages' verbs can or must agree with more than one argument (called 'polypersonal agreement'); usually this is just the basic two core arguments of a transitive verb, and three or more is much rarer (though colloquial French goes to three AIUI) * Some languages have agreement only in some situations and not in others (usually due to non-agreeing subordinate forms turning into main clause forms over time) * Some languages have a different agreement pattern   * The most common alternative to 'subject' versus 'object' (called 'nominative' patterning) is what's called an 'ergative' pattern, where instead of treating the actor in a transitive sentence and the one argument of an intransitive sentence as 'the same thing', it treats the one argument of an intransitive sentence as 'the same thing' as the undergoer of a transitive sentence (Mayan languages are a great example of this along with two-argument polypersonal agreement)   * Some languages have other patterns, including treating single arguments of intransitives differently depending on how 'agentive' that argument is * Some languages (e.g. Japanese) have no agreement marking and also don't require pronouns (they have 'pro-drop'), meaning you can just get a sentence that's a bare unmarked verb and nothing else and the listener is left to infer any participants from context * A few languages do odder things - Yale (an isolate from Papua New Guinea) marks subject agreement via a combination of a prefix and a suffix, and Sandawe (an isolate from Tanzania) marks subject agreement via a clitic that appears on every non-topic argument in a sentence. There's probably other things out there as well. > A verb must always have a subject. At least, in theory. What's the subject of Latin *pluit*? :3 In fact, the above kinds of different ways languages can group arguments means that 'subject' in a traditional sense is not really a useful category crosslinguistically. It's still by far the most common way to do things, though. And welcome to linguistics! There's a *fantastic* variety of things out there to enjoy.
Firstly, I don’t think that would be a retronym. Secondly, based on the [timeline given here](https://www.etymonline.com/word/tantalize), it doesn’t seem likely.
…..does ‘Murica count? Lol
Japanese has quite a bunch of words with b/m alternation, sabisii/samisii is one of those pairs. Can't think of an accent that pronounces Tokyo /d/ as /n/, but older generations in many places across Japan have prenasalisation for voiced consonants - that is, /b/, /d/ /g/ /z/ sound like there's a short nasal sound ('m', 'n') before them (/g/ usually turn straight into [ŋ] (鼻濁音) iirc). Edit: oh I see that you live in Aomori. Then yes, prenasalisation (入り渡り鼻音) is one of *the* defining features for the dialects there (more broadly, in the Northeast). Edit2: typo
I can explain it real simply.  English was a Germanic language engineered and twisted by space aliens to screw with people they knew would one day learn the emerging science of linguistics.  Just write that down.
You should post this to r/badlinguistics.
FWIW, Russian has the word *fintiflı͡uška* (≈ “knick-knack”, “bauble”), attested in literary sources since mid-19th century. Dahl's dictionary (2nd ed., 1882) lists as variants *fintiklejka* and *fintifirı͡ul'ka*. Its etymology is unclear; it's certainly an expressive novel word, which may have been invented (per Vasmer's suggestion) under the influence of the German alliterative pair *Finten und Flausen* (“feints and vanities”).
Yeah, I'm very disappointed by that article and all the coverage I've seen in the mainstream media.  Usually the Guardian's science reporting isn't that bad. They normally ask other scientists for different opinions, but this wasn't done here. I wonder why everyone is reporting that story so uncritically. Is it lack of awareness about linguistics? Is it because it's very exciting to finally place the mysterious Japanese somewhere? Is it because they like the main author's talking points about national identity? I am also a lay person with a passing interest in archaeology and my understanding is that archeological and genetic analysis methods have progressed by leaps and bounds over the last couple of decades. So I am inclined to believe that they could have made a breakthrough with that, but I'm more skeptical of the linguistic part. I'm hoping the Tides of History podcast will do an episode on this, it's a great vulgarisation podcast on the deep past.
There are *thousands* of languages with less than a million speakers. Good luck picking one!
South Indian English has the words "only" and "itself" which are basically analogous to the focus clitics -*dān* and -*ē* in Tamil. "Only " is pretty self explanatory, but it is much further grammaticalized as a focus marker, specifically to highlight that it's referent is already part of the discourse. So you may get: I came from there only - meaning approx. "I actually came from that place, which we are/have been talking about" You only told me this - meaning approx. "You were the one who told me in the first place" Now, "itself" is also pretty intuitive. It is a contrastive focus marker, so it highlights the focussed item in contrast to other items brought up. Often has a similar meaning to "after all." So you may get: He stuck with the basic plan itself - meaning approx. "He stuck with the basic plan after all, even after checking out others" There'll be enough to do in Paris itself - meaning approx. "There'll be enough to do in just Paris, even without going elsewhere" Additionally, there is "off," roughly analogous to the completive/resultative morpheme *-ḍu-* in Tamil (*-biḍu-* in Kannada). So you get: I did it off. You made it off so quickly? Hope that was interesting.
Plot twist they were originally ejective
''However'' is one of those words that's currently undergoing a change in usage. So when I describe the grammar here, you're going to find lots of examples - online, in comments, etc. - that contradict it. 'However' is very similar in meaning to 'but' - both denote or highlight a contrast. 'However' has its own grammar. Normally, it's the first word in a sentence of clause - it comes after a full stop/ period or a semicolon ';'. Normally, 'however' is followed by a comma. This makes its grammar slightly different from 'but', which doesn't require a new sentence. Examples: 'I wanted to go to the cinema. However, it was shut.' *or* 'I wanted ... cinema; however, it was shut.' Compare: 'I wanted to go to the cinema but it was shut'. \[In practice, lots of people currently seem to ignore this, so you'll see things like 'She decided to go running, however it was raining heavily.'\] There's a second use of 'however' as an adverb (I think!). This use is similar to 'no matter how much' / 'how long'/ etc. Example: 'The door won't open however much I push it.' This use isn't quite as common as the first use ('however' = 'but')
Nope, never heard that down here in Australia.  Didn't know such a construction exists. Closest I can't think of is "I ain't" as in "I ain't going down there", which is pretty common here, but very informal.
In sports, we generally "sub in" and "sub out" players, so that suggests that there is enough ambiguity to warrant clarification. That being said, to me the phrase has only ever been "Substitute [modified] for [original]." Doing it the other way sounds like someone is trying to ape the phrase "Replace [original] with [modified]" without realizing that the replace and substitute aren't interchangeable without also changing the object of the sentence.
> "[t]he distinction between /a/ and /ɑ/, as in the words patte and pâte, tends to be attenuated in France." It means that most dialects from France do not make the distinction, not that the sound are close when a distinction is made. Also you put "in" and "un" even further away to how at least I pronounce them that they already were. And finaly, don't make general conclusions based on your own pronunciation, especially shen you appear to not be a native speaker. On top of that, I'm pretty sure wikipedia bans original work. The only good thing about your change is that given the state of French wikipedia on linguistics or the state of English wikipedia on French (it seems every contributor makes generalisations based on their own dialect), you can't damage anything of value.
Different languages will work in different ways, of course, but generally, anything not encoded in morphology will be either facilitated by analytic constructions (i.e. constructions like English causative *make*, in addition to morphological marking), or just adding information lexically (adding more descriptors to characterize the action). Tamil, for example, has two causatives, one fully bound, the other one more ambiguous as to it's morphosyntactic status. The first one is purely a valency changing operation, while the other one carries more semantic content (though, bleached of quite a bit of it). So, *ōḍ-* = "to run,"  *ōṭ-* = "to run (smth)," and with the auxillary *ve-* (lexical meaning = "to put"), *ōḍ-a-ve-* = "to make (smth) run," and *ōṭ-a-ve-* = "to make (smth) run (smth)"
I think you've got the dates mixed up a bit. Afaik we have different niqud systems that show the difference in pronunciation from the time of the Babylonian exile which is a couple of hundreds BC,  with the Arab conquest and empire which came hundreds of years after the Babylonian exile, the different pronunciations seems to have already been present by then. According to the Wikipedia article on the Canaanite shift: >The Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation of qamaṣ gadōl as [ɔ] instead of [aː] (as found in other dialects) is regarded by Abraham Zevi Idelsohn as a further extension of the Canaanite shift (on his theory, the Ashkenazic dialect is derived from that of Galilee in the early centuries CE). A similar shift is observable in the coastal dialects of Syrian Arabic (see Levantine Arabic).  it seems like the Canaanite shift was just stronger up north. Also the Canaanite shift Wikipedia article in Hebrew, says the Canaanite shift had stopped being productive in Hebrew during the second temple period, citing how it doesn't affect later loanwords.  From the Phoenician language Wikipedia article:  >The most conspicuous vocalic development in Phoenician is the so-called Canaanite shift, shared by Biblical Hebrew, but going further in Phoenician. The Proto-Northwest Semitic /aː/ and /aw/ became not merely /oː/ as in Tiberian Hebrew, but /uː/. Stressed Proto-Semitic /a/ became Tiberian Hebrew /ɔː/ (/aː/ in other traditions), but Phoenician /oː/. This seems to support the shift was stronger up north. Maybe Tiberian Hebrew was even more influenced by phonetician.
people naturally mimic whoever they’re speaking to in verbal and nonverbal language. your dad for example is unknowingly building a rapport with an irish person when he mimics the accent, and i bet he also minics the person’s hand gestures and such. it’s a method for building relationships between people
The example I can provide here is precisely of the kind “language L has incorporated a lot of -isms”, but bear with me. The language is Spanish and the process was more or less similar, I believe, to what happened in most Western European languages. Spanish until the end of the Middle Ages had followed a path of regular evolution from Vulgar Latin. A lot of Germanic words entered Romance from the beginning of the 5th century, and there had been a massive adoption of Arabic words into Iberian Romance starting in the 8th century, but these words were organically adapted to Spanish phonology. In the 13th there were the first attempts of creating a standardized Spanish for administrative uses, and the original Latin spellings of many words were reintroduced, but it's doubtful whether the actual pronunciation of those words was changed as well. Then in the 16th century, a flood of Latin words poured into Spanish, as poets and writers, influenced by classical and Italian models, started reintroducing or recovering archaic forms and Latin words back into early modern Spanish. This was different from earlier mass borrowing processes because 1) it was deliberate and 2) it actually changed Spanish phonotactics, as consonant clusters which had been simplified centuries ago were now again allowed (e.g. words like *abstracto, transformar, exacto, perfecto, maligno* and *admitir*). A lot of these Latinisms displaced older Spanish words, while others formed doublets, e.g. *rezar* “to pray” vs. *recitar* “to recite”, *raudo* “swift” vs. *rápido* “fast”, *siesta* “siesta, afternoon nap” vs. *sexta* “sixth (hour)”, etc. One interesting side effect was the replenishment of the stock of words with antepenultimate stress in Spanish: many Latin words are antepenultimate-stressed, but the evolution of Romance had often syncopated middle unstressed vowels, leaving the vast majority of pre-modern Spanish words with penultimate stress.
The traditional upper-class English accent (20th century "posh" R.P.) had a lot of vocal fry at the end of utterances. The last audio clip on the following page, just above the video of Jacob Rees-Mogg, demonstrates the creaky-voice vowels.  That's a female speaker but you can hear it from older men as well. https://pronunciationstudio.com/upper-received-pronunciation/
> he will have an accent and will never get a native level of English, despite growing up in America. Those are two things > he will have an accent Maybe. Its very possible he may end up with a 'hard to place' accent. I know one friend that has it, and they don't sound foreign but don't sound native. Country hopping during childhood has a similar effect. >he ... will never get a native level of English, despite growing up in America. This is unlikely and is a baseless fear. If growing up IN the culture, then its extremely unlikely that he will not be at native level. I'm not aware on studies of similar conditions but all evidence I'm aware of does not point to multiple languages impeding native language if thats the country they live in. The "you can't use X language because it means you'll never be good ay Y language" is a common cultural myth that has some quite honestly racist and ablist background to it. Not to call people who have believed or perpetuated it to some extent bigoted, but I'm just adressing the elephant in the room. I've heard some suggestions that there is a reduction in overall voabulary in all languages of a polyglot BUT not to the level that they aren't/can't-be fluent/native in the language in question. And its not like fluent/native  monoglots are usually aware of the the full vocab of their language anyway, everyone has huge blindspots.
I used it for a master's paper and quite liked it.  Be careful if you go to a UK university though, I think its free to most public institutions in the EU but  brexit.
What a ridiculous post. Either you are trolling or you’re an offensive asshole.
In Serafim & Shinzato (2020), it’s said that Old Okinawan possesses two very similar “T-type affixes,” one of them being *-t°i* (linking/conjunctive) and the other *-t°ee* (perfective predicate/non-conjunctive), where <°> denotes lack of aspiration. While I trust their analysis of the second affix as having a long vowel due to their thorough analysis of the texts’ metrical character, I’m confused on why they describe them as having different vowel qualities /i/ vs. /e/. In the cited example sentences from the *Omoro Sōshi*, these affixes and their allomorphs were apparently always spelled the same: * *-t°i & -t°ee* = て * *-c°yi & -c°yee* = ちへ/ちゑ * *-di & -dee* = で * *-ʣyi & -ʣyee* = ぢへ/ぢゑ And as far as I can tell, Modern Shuri-Naha Okinawan doesn’t support there being any vowel quality distinction between them: There’s the linking/conjunctive suffix *-ti* ( < *-t°i*), so that checks out... And the “perfective” form (limited to yes/no-questions in ModOk) takes the form *-tii*. (Serafim & Shinzato note that this can be analyzed synchronically as the above *-ti* plus the yes/no-particle *yi*, though this doesn’t mean that it’s etymologically the case.) ...So, **does anyone have any idea why Serafim & Shinzato would even suggest a vowel quality distinction *-t°i* vs. *-t°ee* between these Old Okinawan “T-type affixes”** rather than *-t°i* vs. *-t°ii*? (With the latter getting re-analyzed as *-t°i + yi* in ModOk?) Do other Northern Ryukyuan languages support such a distinction?
It could well be specific to that corpus/website. Have you looked through their documentation?
>I honestly can’t decide whether language influences thought or thought is influenced by language.  Why does it have to be one or the other? >Noam Chomsky believed in Universal Grammar and some proof for that is Zipf’s law Noam Chomsky is still alive. Zipf's Law refers to the fact that  many types of data follow a Zipfian distribution. It is an observation about the statistical distributions of data. While (some types of) data in linguistics do (tend to) follow a Zipfian distribution, it has nothing to do with Universal Grammar. Where are you getting that idea? >Zipf’s law basically says every language can be figured out, hinting at a universal translator. No, it doesn't. Some researchers looking at ancient texts or coded texts might sometimes use Zipf's law in their efforts to translate them, but it does not "hint at a universal translator."  I'm not sure where to start untangling the misunderstandings about Zipf's Law you have here, but they are rather large. You have given it much more significance than it actually has. >Yet this study of the Namibia tribe shows that language controls our    perception of color. The Namibia people could not identify the color    blue The experiment described in the article you link does not show that at all. They do not even test children's ability to identify colors.

You might be remembering a famous experiment that was popularized by the BBC that showed the Himba unable to tell the difference between green and blue squares. The problem is that the BBC made it up: [https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=17970](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=17970) >What is the most widely believed consensus by most modern linguists? That there have been small-scale demonstrations of specific influences of language on thought, such as the color recall test above. The effects are rather minor and might not even be noticeable outside of a lab. We know that language doesn't *determine* thought, because we can think and perceive things we have no language for. Deeper questions, such as whether thought is structured like language or whether (or how) language influences our worldview, are not easily testable. Most linguists I know reject strong claims in this area.
afaik it's just a normal [l], or at least that's how I pronounce it as a native/heritage speaker.
Google the phrase "heritage speaker".  There are classes designed for people in your situation, which use the knowledge you have already in your mind to "activate" your Spanish competence.
I literally wrote my thesis on this. The thesis itself is actually about r-nasalization in Hoocąk, but on page 51, I include a table of all the languages that I was able to find with a nasalized alveolar flap.  Edit: link has been removed so as not to permanently doxx myself.
The term pidgin is used to refer specifically to the means of communication used by communities that could not otherwise communicate. Pidgins are not natural languages; they're artificial and so are limited in expression. They may lack certain communicative functions because they're only used in limited contexts.  However, any natural language, that is, any language learned as a native language by a community, is as capable of expressing ideas as any other. Pidgins can become native languages in some cases, when this happens, the native speakers "fill in the gaps" so to speak. Though it's clear the end result is a natural language, the exact process of how this happens is debated.  The resulting natural language is sometimes called a creole, though there are also creoles that were never pidgins and it's a bit of an argument in the study of these languages what exactly the terms should be.  Solomon's Pidgin, despite the name, is a natural language with a native speaker community, though it also has a much larger second language community (much like English). It is not just a simplified form of English, in fact, it has certain grammatical features not present in English, such as clusivity. For example, Solomon's Pidgin distinguishes between a first person group that does not include the listener and one that does include the listener.
By analogy to plurals like “parentheses“ and “hypotheses” probably. It happens with “biases” as well.
The ampersand has latin origin during ancient Rome from writing "et" in cursive(ie et tu, Brutus? "and you, Brutus?"). It frequently was added after the letter Z, so some see it as having been the 27th letter of the latin alphabet at one point and would have been similar to modern English "A" and "I" as doubling as a letter and word except for latin. It has, of course, since been dropped from the latin alphabet. I would say it has the same meaning at least in European languages as Latin would have had much influence there. Today it may have spread to other language speakers as with the expansion of world interconnectedness with the internet and all that.

1. He literally cites a study that demonstrates that speakers of a language with grammatical gender have their perception of an object influenced by its gender. You may claim that it has no relation with human gender, but empirically, at least according to that study, it does. He also explains how he couldn’t find convincing academic explanations for the existence of grammatical gender, especially when he says only a quarter of languages have it. Granted he didn’t cite any literature, but a quick trip on Wikipedia shows that there is at least one study confirming this. I do agree however that it is a bit unscientific and anglocentric for him to toss it up as “useless”. 2. He never argues to get rid of grammatical gender? Once he’s done giving his quick rundown on grammatical gender, he moves on to how in English there exists a non gendered third person singular pronoun, and how it can be used for non-binary people, or just situations where gender is ambiguous or irrelevant. If he supported that grammatical gender be abolished, he would’ve expressed how speakers of English would have to stop using he/she and aforementioned few gendered words.  3. While grammatical gender in other languages in somewhat of a subject of ridicule in this video, it is overall well presented with academic sources. You’re not the only one who feels offended by that though, as the reason he closed the comments was because there were many angry speakers of languages with grammatical gender in the comments. But it’s not like native speakers aren’t aware of at least on some level a tingle of absurdity that comes with grammatical gender. As a speaker of French at least, I know it has been pointed out for comedic effect, and being corrected for using the wrong gender for a word as a child feels confusing (although that’s also a prescriptivist problem).  I feel like you’re getting too worked up over a 3 minute video. He’s not asking you to start speaking differently in your language for his ideology (which is just being more inclusive when referring to people with different gender identities, btw, nothing crazy).  Also, funny how you say “How would it even function?” When you yourself have intentionally composed sentences in English without articles.  That aside, this video isn’t perfect, I agree. It detracts from the point of the video, which is to showcase singular they. But that’s not just me talking. Tom Scott has included a correction to his video in his description, maybe if you paid attention just a bit more... https://www.tomscott.com/gender-neutral-pronouns/ All in all, understandable that you might feel offended, as you’re not the only one, but also the video is nowhere near as bad as you’re making it out to be.
Re. UG, Mark Baker's "The Natures of Nonconfigurationality" is inspiring, and fairly accessible for newcomers. It's the paper that caused me to become a linguist, fwiw.  It looks at several radically different (and very un-English-like) languages and proposes that their differences follow naturally from a universal set of grammatical principles employed in slightly different ways, with far-reaching consequences for the surface patterns of the syntax. You can find it for free online.
Does anybody know of schools in Japan with strong PhD programs in Linguistics? I've looked around and found linguists working in more general Japanese departments but very few (non-applied) Linguistics departments.
I am incompetent at all forms of math and love both phonetics and syntax. The human brain is weird and we all like different things and are good at different things.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperforeignism My favorite is Beijing. The "j" should sound like "dz" but everyone pronounces it like a French "j".
Not all of them but... complicated and confusing case system, whereby an ending can denote many different cases, and one case can be represented by different endings, with different patterns depending on plurality, gender, stem type etc. On top of that declension often changes the stem. Also, the relationship between case and its real life usage is often vague and seemingly arbitrary.  In contrast, in Uralic and Turkic the relationship between cases and endings is closer to 1:1.  Each case's function is delineated much more clearly and stem alterations are rare. One caveat is that in these groups case endings have multiple versions depending on vowel harmony, but their usage is mostly regular and intuitive.
In English, onomatopoeia are frequently made up on the spot. For the record, native English speakers are likely to find your native onomatopoeia charming (and are likely to understand them from context), so you don’t truly need to learn ours. Also, it’s my experience that some onomatopoeia *are* taught in L2 courses. I know how to quack and bark in Swedish.  As for lists, [there is one on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_onomatopoeias), and you can look them up by googling “sound a dog makes”, “sound a door makes”, etc.
This apparently might be an example. Oxford Language’s (from Google) etymology for the word “gag”: “Middle English: perhaps related to Old Norse gagháls ‘with the neck thrown back’, or imitative of a person choking.” It might be an example of false onomatopoeia (coming from an Old Norse word unrelated to choking), but it might also be true onomatopoeia. Best I can do! haha
I don't really have a title for this question, but i do have a minor existential crisis:  I'm a language student and have just completed my second year studying Slavic languages (Major in Russian, Minor in Serbo-Croatian) at university. My native language is Dutch. This September I will start preparing for writing my bachelor's thesis, later this year or at the start of 2022. A few months ago I discovered I'm really interested in historical and comparative Indo-European linguistics, especially when it comes to Balto-Slavic, after an introductory lesson that was part of our course Slavic Philology (that mostly concerned OCS).     I am particularly interested in the “unexplained centumization” of certain Slavic words (e.g.  Russian *камень* < \*h₂éḱmō) and basically everything that has to do with the RUKI sound law when it comes to Slavic languages as well. I also believe that there are some research possibilities regarding these lagoons.     Basically, I have one concern: am I too late to the party? Is it too late for me to start reading up on the subject only now, at the start of my academic year in which I want to write my bachelor's thesis on the topic? On one hand, I am so relieved that after what feels like an eternity (two years) I finally found a research field and topic that genuinely interests me, and that I don't have to settle for something that I only care for half-heartedly. But at the same time I feel like I'm way behind on most of my friends and colleague students, who already knew what path they wanted to follow when starting their training, and already had a year or longer of exploring the topic and preparing. Everyone seems to go for politics, literature or socio-economic issues. As far as I know, I'm currently the only student in my department that wants to do something with linguistics; we have one PhD student for Old Church Slavonic, but she should finish/graduate this December. Her promotor/thesis supervisor used to be the same professor that introduced me to the topic, and has offered to be my mentor as well (I have emailed him about my curiosity, and we have spoken about it face to face, but only once). But there is something about him that bothers me. I had already heard some stories about him being really sloppy and indifferent when guiding students, and when I went to speak to the woman PhD-ing in OCS about it, she kind of confirmed my worries: she went through a whole procedure to change to a promotor from a different department of our faculty, because of how unhelpful, demotivating and generally uninterested he was. Now, given the fact that her topic (OCS) and what I find interesting are different, I want to give him the benefit of doubt. But also because of this, I feel like there is no one I can reach out to with my non-specific questions. I also don't want to hype him by showing interest, asking help finding my way in the topic and literature and explaining concepts, when I feel really held-back by and worried after the stories I've heard about him, that make me wonder if I should even go through with it. Talking to him directly, he seemed really kind and enthusiastic about my interests. But I heard that if he doesn’t find a new student to mentor after the PhD in OCS graduates, his department could be shut down due to a lack of interest by students and the faculty not wanting to waste any resources. This makes me think that he is just trying to lure me in as a survival strategy for himself. I know it sucks that I let the people I'd hypothetically have to work with affect my judgement. But this is a major life decision that will also affect my mental health and probably even my future career (even though I am very well aware that a career in historical linguistics is rather unlikely), so I really need a good mentor.     Professor told me that a good start would be to read ‘Comparative Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction’ by Beekes and Gabriner. He doesn’t seem concerned at all about the fact that I’m an absolute beginner; I don’t know what to believe, but does this man in his 50s seriously think that I can catch up on half a lifetime’s worth of knowledge in like half a year, or am I just panicking and exaggerating things?   So I started reading Beekes, and approaching the final chapter I have ordered ‘Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction’ by Fortson, which I found under the resource recommendations here on this subreddit. Do you guys think this is a good start?    If you have made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this. I’d truly appreciate your (realistic) opinion/ advice/ point of view on my situation. Any concrete recommendations that you might have, are also more than welcome.
The idea of the noticing hypothesis came from Schmidt's self-reflections while learning Portuguese.
>similar phonology Not really. >counters This is generally seen as common influence from Chinese AFAIK. As for the main question. It is not unlikely, there are some quite strong voices proposing such grouping, but the problem is that the number of cognates is very slim. If Koreanic and Japonic are related, the division was so long ago that very little evidence remains. Especially problematic is that for Korean we have very small corpus of texts from its early stages and its written using Hanja, obscuring the phonetic shape of words. If you want some reads, I recommend works of John Whitman, Marshall J. Unger and Alexander Francis-Ratte. For counter arguments you can try Alexander Vovin, as his works can be found freely online. Generally, the counter argument for similarity of grammar, is that it can also be borrowed between languages. Koreanic and Japonic have been living next to each other for \~3000 years (Yayoi migrations into Japan are currently estimated to have begun as early as 900BCE), and writing was introduced to Japan from Korea. Early Yamato Kingdom had very close ties with Korean kingdoms, exchanging populations, even some families serving both in Yamato in Baekje.  Not to mention that it is speculated that during the early Three Kingdoms era the population of South Korea was mixed, with Japonic population being slowly assimilated by Koreanic. So, there was plenty of time for linguistic exchange to occur.
This isn't an absolute rule, as others have said. But it is a natural tendency, because of acoustic reasons. >the association of lip rounding with back vowels has to do with reinforcing the low-pitched acoustic overtones that are characteristic of back vowels. Rounding and protruding the lips lowers the frequencies of the acoustic resonances of the vocal tract to add to the lowering effect produced by the action of backing the body of the tongue. A rounded back vowel is therefore more clearly distinct from other vowels than an unrounded one https://wals.info/chapter/11 Another similar tendency mentioned in the article: high vowels are also more commonly rounded, since it's easy to round your lips when your jaw is more closed.
No. PIE is only the stage that is recoverable through current science. It is very probable, though hard to confirm, that PIE had sister languages which like modern IE languages traced back to some proto language, which in turn also had sister languages etc.  No one knows when homo sapiens started to speak. Some propose that even Neanderthals could have had this ability.
Icelandic famously has very few loanwords, instead preferring to coin new terms using existing native vocabulary. > Other than the obvious Hungarian or Finnish Can't speak for Hungarian, but Finnish definitely has a lot of loanwords of Latin/Greek origin, especially scientific terms, albeit definitely a bit less than most other European languages.
It might be more productive to go to forums on the specific ethnic communities in the U.S. The most obvious use of Welsh and Gaelic would be in church services.  There's a recent dictionary of purported Irish Gaelic loanwords in American English that should be a little bit on topic. Don't have author or title, but it was published just in the last 15 years by an Irish-American professor in New York City who is not a linguist. It's a fascinating collection of suggestions. It's marred with a few duds that betray lack of due diligence. This author claimed that the English language got the word 'cross' from Gaelic. This is historically unlikely, because the word comes from Latin, it entered Germanic and Celtic as a Christian term, and Ireland was Christianized after the island of Britain was. Ireland was evangelized by Saint Patrick, who was a Welshman.
Alternative possibility; its a way of performatively showing that you are controlling your speech and using it in a highpy coordinated way to avoid /ə/ and this case that means making an /ε/. So its completely unnatural. Wonder if other evidence could back this up or rebuke it. Edit; I guess some supporting evidence; "Hark the heralds, angels sing. The new king's born today. And man will live forever more, because of Christmass day." <e> [ε] in angels, <o> as [ɔ](?) in forever, <au> as [ɔ] (again?) in because, <a> as [ɑ] in Christmass. I'm bad at IPA vowels so corrections welcome.
*The* is a word that behaves similarly at least most of the time, where individual identifiability is an important part of the word's use. It is somewhat different, though, in that *they* depends on not knowing the referent's identity well enough to have the information needed for *he* or *she*, while *the* only depends on knowing which specific referent is being talked about regardless of whatever other information is known about that referent. Other similar words are things like *a certain* or *some (or other)* or the formal use of generic *one*. Again, not exactly the same, but still hinging on questions of identifiability. I don't think *they*'s use for 'individually identifiable but lacking full identity information' is all that odd in such company, especially given that there's really no decent alternative option.
I’d assume Swedish influence, but then I don’t know why Swedish changed ø æ to ö ä but not y to ü
A thumb is just a type of finger..... We just have a specific name for it, along with index finger, middle finger, pinky etc (I'm not sure what the other one by the pinky is called) You don't differentiate a thumb from the other fingers in your language? That seems a bit odd as a thumb functions quite a bit differently to the other fingers.
Strictly speaking, saying "Yes" to "Do you mind?" isn't the same as no, but I get what you're talking about. I don't have an answer for you, but it might be worth looking up the German word "doch" - it could lead you to the answer
Your question is impossible to answer in any worth while manner without knowing: A) the type of job being done B) the area you live in C) any benefits or other compensation D) the currency being spoken about.
Why do you think there is an H in these words at all? The Anglo-Saxon word for “why” was *hwy* which came from Proto-Germanic *hwī*. And “what” comes from Anglo-Saxon *hwæt*. In these Anglo-Saxon words the H was definitely pronounced. I believe it was a spelling reform which swapped the *hw-* to *wh-*. It’s not an Irish thing, not all Irish speakers have preserved the /h/ sound, and there are UK dialects and American dialects which preserve it too.
~~I think that 4 and 5 are pretty much indistinguishable because once airflow is completely obstructed, the voicing (driven by airflow causing the oscillation of the vocal folds) would automatically stop. Strictly speaking, of course, we might argue that~~ there is an ~~infinitesimal~~ (edit: see u/IntoTheCommonestAsh 's reply) gap between 4 and 5, so quick that we can't register it. So I would say \[t\] lasts from ~~5 to 7~~ **4 to 7** (edit: thanks to the same user again) inclusively. The thing about IPA transcriptions, wonderful as they are, is that they give the impression of sound units in perfect back-to-back order -- discrete, self-contained units. The truth is that all these articulatory gestures overlap (e.g. in 2, the occlusion for \[t\] is beginning to take shape when \[a\] is still being produced). These coarticulations make it hard to draw a line between segments without the abstractions and "simplification" offered by the IPA. However, if you look at a gestural score, which plots the articulatory gestures against time, you see how they overlap.
Yes.  The conventional description of the PIE voiced aspirates is that they were produced in the same manner as the stops that survive today in Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi.
You're picking up evidence of a nonstandard dialect of English, maybe African American English.  This has nothing to do with educational levels or intelligence, it's just another form of English.
A professor of mine studied Kartvelian languages. He's from Quebec, but he learned Russian in order to study Georgian, because there was a lot of literature on Georgian that had never been translated into English (or French). So if you speak Russian, searching for information in Russian may be something to try.
They are both voiceless fricatives whose noise source is a rush of air passing over some part of the tongue that is forming a constriction with the upper articulators. This sounds like a homework question :D
Well, you'd be wrong, for one thing. The Russian language doesn't have the /th/ sound. Russians speaking English as an L2 struggle with it and most (initially, at least) pronounce it more like a /z/.
I think the core ideas are not very hard to understand.  I think the fact that "ergative" is used for multiple meanings like the case ending, the semantic structure, and the syntactic structure without explicitly mentioning that they're different meanings of the same word, and the fact that I don't speak a language that uses them so that I can't have a direct example, and the fact that whenever it is mentioned it is followed by specialised terms like "agent", "antipassive", "syntactic alignment" and other terms that you otherwise don't see a lot, are the reasons why it seems so overwhelmingly confusing at first.
I would think Melanesian creoles, like Tok Pisin, Bislama and Pijin would have resources.
Looks very cool! Thanks for sharing. :)
Language change. Studying how languages change over time is fun, though my interest seems to be limited to Sinitic for now. Sprachbund effects are something I want to explore further, but don't have the resources or time to look into now, such as the spread of evidentiality in the Balkans
It’s probably worth noting, though it doesn’t actually impact upon your question in general, that ‘soccer’ is derived from ‘association football’ in the same way as ‘rugger’ (now archaic) is derived from ‘rugby football’, originating in the slang of English Public (private) schools.  It’s still in use in most English-speaking places where there are other football codes competing with soccer (even in the UK to some degree).  The point I’ve made a very bad attempt at making is that it’s not really an example of the concept in question.
Yes. It’s common (for me) with Romance languages in particular. I can often overhear and partially understand a language without knowing what it is
Catalan is not a dialect, but a language. The same goes for Galician.
Accent coach here. So, as you seem to have realized already, the idea that tongue hight, tongue backness, and lip rounding determine vowel quality is an approximation. A better approximation (but still an approximation) is that vowel quality is determined by the first three formants: F1, F2, and F3. Very broadly speaking, F1 is higher the lower the tongue is, F2 is higher the more forward the tongue is, and all three are higher the less rounded the lips are. Thus, the act of rounding the lips can compensate an opening and the jaw and leave F1 essentially unchanged.
There are a lot of Norse to English borrowings stemming from the early Viking invasions - but even before that, these languages both descend from the same group of West Germanic speaking peoples.
The beginning of the understanding of the Indo-European family, as far as we know, is Sir William Jones' 1786 speech to the Royal Asiatic Society. He was a British man who had worked in the imperial government in India, studied Sanskrit, and observed that it was so similar to Greek and Latin that they must all be related.
Diachronica doesn’t list any examples of k > n but there are a few of k > ŋ in some environments. So, it’s not impossible that you can have this shift over time: k > ŋ > n. Similarly, there are some examples of ŋ > k in some environments, so I could imagine n > ŋ > k is possible.
As an Indian, one reason is that in recent years there has been an explosion of internet which (surprise, surprise) has resulted in inane whatsapp forwards which provide bold claims such as: "Sanskrit is the oldest language in the world" "Sanskrit is the mother of all languages" and my personal favourite "Sanskrit is the best language for coding" It's a mix of a massive inferiority complex (remnants of being oppressed for years by the British), nationalist propaganda and pure ignorance.
Derivation is the process of making new words from existing roots, it can be more or less spontaneous. Descendants are just later forms of an earlier word, time necessarily needs to pass for them to come into being, which is a way to distinguish it from derivation. Hound is a descendant of hund, while hounds is a derivation of it (by adding the plural suffix -s to the root hound). PIE has a really robust system of derivation using various roots and affixes. Some of these derived words fossilised into full roots of their own, so descendants can come from derivations.
“One thousand twenty-three” is American and sounds very jarring to me. Brits always say “one thousand *and* twenty-three”. The latter option, “ten twenty-three” is far more commonly used with years as far as I can tell, maybe with money where one may say it for £10.23. In Welsh this doesn’t happen because its vigesimal system is too restricted. When talking about years Welsh usually just gives each individual digit, e.g. *un naw wyth saith* for 1987 (literally ‘one nine eight seven’).
I disagree. It's diverged greatly in the past centuries. The reason people from different locations can converse with each other "without any issues" is due to exposure/adoption of standard English(es). Speakers code switch between their regional variety of English and the standard variety (be it UK, US or wherever English is spoken natively). These standards are not as different from one another as are, say, a local variety of English in the US Midwest compared to the North of England. But I would say that divergence has been slowed by exposure to standard English through media, education and interaction such as /u/respighi points out.
We cannot help you if you do not provide the information you're asking about.
Sure, in English just about everything gets called a bee in casual use. Check out r/bees and look at how many people post pictures of wasps and hornets asking what kind of bee they are.  In fact, the two animals aren't really that similar. People, generally speaking, are keen observers of nature and have been living with bees and honey since the dawn of time. They are very likely to have know that bees are not like wasps, and thus to have different words for them.
The IPA is able to write intonation, which is a big part of what makes a question sound different from a statement Edit: I thought that in all languages intonation is used as a (sometimes redundant, sometimes only) marker of questions, but apparently that's not the case. Sorry for the mix-up!
Similar to “dick” in the US, but it describes someone a bit less “nasty” and a bit more “arrogant” or “rude” than the American equivalent does. It’s not from a specific area of Britain. You might want to check out /r/AskUK for questions like this.
I've actually heard all of those misconceptions even said by native speakers of Semitic languages who aren't too invested in Semitic Linguistics.  All of them though are false, and Semiticians (Westerners and us native Semitic speaking folk in the field(in my case, an MA Semitic Linguistics student so I wouldn't call myself a Semitican just yet) ) dislike them and I'll try to go over them one by one.  > My question is, what are the corresponding emic statements? How would a native speaker of one or more Semitic languages, who has studied the grammar of their language, explain to someone how their vowels work? > Semitic languages are inherently consonant-based. Semitic languages have consonant roots that are applied to primarily vowel based stems. Those stems also carry quite a lot of meaning and it's an archaic way to think of Semitic languages. For example: the stem C(1)aC(2)aC(3)(+person/number/gender suffix) represents the perfective aspect/past tense for plain verbs in West Semitic languages. You can put in it any root consonants, but if a single vowel is shifted, the meaning shifts and your verb say might become intensive or passive, or you might change the entire verb into a participle. For example, in Hebrew, sh-m-r (to guard) with the example I gave: shamar 'he protected', shumar 'it was preserved', shimer 'he preserved (it)', shomer 'a guard/he is guarding'. That's the meaning the vowels carry here. Both the consonants and vowels decide the meaning.  > Vowels play a less important role in the Semitic languages' way of encoding meaning than they do in IE languages. Just like there's minimal pairs in IE languages based on vowels, there are also plenty in all Semitic languages. In Hebrew, we have sefer 'book', safar 'he counted', sofer 'author' and siper 'he told', sapar 'barber', sipur 'story' and super 'supermarket'. There are no less minimal pairs via vowels in Semitic languages than there are in IE languages. > Semitic languages have approximants instead of true vowels. Each of their "vowels" is better thought of as an unusually open variation of a consonant sound What approximates are /a/, /e/, /o/, etc? Arabic even has a few dialects that go up to over 10 short vowels (before we even discuss long ones) and many non-Semitic languages also only have only 3 short vowels like Proto-Semitic did so why are we only describing Semitic languages as "only approximates, no vowels"? > The concept of vowels was unknown to the Phoenicians when they came up with their writing system. The concept was borrowed back into the Semitic languages, from non-Semitic-speaking peoples who borrowed and adapted the Phoenician writing system for their languages Long vowels were marked in the Phoenician script overtime and in other Canaanite languages due to diphthong contraction (/aw/ -> /o:/, /ay/ -> /e:/) which turned /w/ and /j/ letters into markers for long vowels. From there, it expended into the consonant for the glottal stop also representing long /a/ vowels (due to other phonological processes that dropped glottal stops in certain positions and lengthened vowels) and for those first two also being used for /u:/ and /i:/. This is a natural, internal, development of the Semitic writing systems without outside intervention. Also, not all Semitic languages use abjads and the first written Semitic language (Akkadian) wrote out all vowels. Also to note, many Semitic languages use vowel modification to mark root phonemes (say Akkadian changes vowels to /e/ as part of some roots, instead of using a consonant there) and the root-stem system in Semitic languages also exists in other North Afroasiatic languages, so it's not unique to only them.
Spanish speaker here. What are the Indo-European roots of these words? From Wiktionary I can see the -ar in “par” and “pêrar” is from *yeh₁r-, *yóh₁r̥. If so, the modern Spanish cognate is “hora”, borrowed into Latin from Greek, and the modern English cognates are “year” (native Germanic) and “hour” (through Greek, Latin and Old French). I’m not sure on where “do” comes from, but if it’s cognate to the Persian root di- (as in “diruz”, yesterday, and “dišab”, last night), then it comes from *dʰǵʰyés, making it cognate to Spanish “ayer” and English “yester-“.
I think it's a free variation thing.  For me I pronounce [nj] or [ɲ] interchangeably so I wouldn't call it a phoneme of its own.  Could be different for other speakers.
Classical Latin uses mid-sentence asides all the time, and some of them are really long or even have further asides nested into them. This is mad especially difficult because they aren’t marked with any kind of punctuation. Furthermore, there was a poetic convention of placing the verb at the end of a sentence. So sometimes you wade through a whole paragraphs worth of parentheticals without knowing what the sentence is about yet.
Tell me about it.  Here I am, a native speaker of English, and I'm not even English!  Somebody ought to rationalize these messy human languages sometime.
This is actually extremely common in probably all languages. Stops are not always produced as stops in the speech you hear everyday, fricatives and approximants are common. Warner and Tucker (2011) found that this was the case for American English, Barry and Andreeva (2001) found this for six different languages, and I'm currently finding this to be the case for Spanish. Look up phonetic reduction if you'd like to know more.  Barry, W., & Andreeva, B. (2001). Cross-language similarities and differences in spontaneous speech patterns. Journal of the International Phonetic Association, 31(1), 51-66. Warner, N., & Tucker, B. V. (2011). Phonetic variability of stops and flaps in spontaneous and careful speech. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 130(3), 1606-1617.
There doesn't really need to be a reason for a feature to be kept. Just like in the evolution of species, where vestigial features are a thing, vestigial features also occur in languages
“That’s Not What I Meant!: How Conversational Style Makes or Breaks Relationships” by Deborah Tannen is a really interesting read. I had to read it for a class and I ended up really enjoying it. Not sure if its exactly what you’re looking for but a very interesting sociolinguistic topic nonetheless.
Irish makes a similar distinction between “tá” and “is” “Tá Liam ina mhúinteoir” would mean Liam is a teacher at the moment or is currently working as a teacher, while “Is múinteoir é Liam” would imply that being a teacher is a more permanent characteristic of Liam.
A person who studies language in a scientific way. Like biologist, etc. I was a translator first, and then I became a linguist. I would never have called myself a linguist then, if that's what you ask
I love that guy. Evolution of language is my favourite linguistics related subject
It's used this way in southern Appalachia. The verb is pronouned *borry*.  He leant me his shotgun = He borried meëez shotgun. In Spanish the verb *prestar* means both *to lend* and *to* *borrow* ("take loaned"). In German the verb *leihen* means *to* *borrow*, while *to* *lend* is *ausleihen* ("borrow out")
Why not? Both work.
It seems like you're conflating two distinct topics and identifying them as having one root cause, if you will. The first is lexical compositionality, i.e. how straightforwardly the morphemes in a word are understood as part-of-the-larger-whole. The second is whether a particular writing system is pictographic, i.e. whether the writing system reflects the actual (physical/real-world) appearance of the concepts, people, etc. that it references.
I would go by precedent. There’s a word to describe the inability to feel pleasure, and if you’re that, you’re anhedonic — so that would make your word anhomocodic (Two people having the same tax code. Amazing)
(Layman here) In Tagalog, verbs take different forms depending on whether they're accidental or intentional. What is this phenomenon called? I couldn't find a description of this even after *minutes* of googling. Example:   ***Nasunog*** *yung dokumento.*   That document was [accidentally] burned.   ***Sinunog*** *yung dokumento.*   That document was [intentionally] burned.   What is this concept called, and what other languages have it?
I don't think that's the "typical" American pronunciation. Sounds like a Philadelphia/New Jersey accent.
The Dutch Meertens Institute has thorough etymology on all Dutch family names (and first names, too). They say Jeijsman is a version of Eijsman.  Heijsman is another version. Unfortunately, they don't explain the meaning. &#x200B; [https://www.cbgfamilienamen.nl/nfb/detail\_naam.php?gba\_naam=Jeijsman&nfd\_naam=Jeijsman+%28y%29&info=analyse+en+verklaring&operator=eq&taal=](https://www.cbgfamilienamen.nl/nfb/detail_naam.php?gba_naam=Jeijsman&nfd_naam=Jeijsman+%28y%29&info=analyse+en+verklaring&operator=eq&taal=)
> I'm curious, have others noticed this pattern, or is it just me? I certainly have. Unfortunately, a lot of people still have not moved past the 'linguistics deals with langue and not parole' mindset. > Separately, but relatedly: do you think it *makes sense* to treat socio-cultural issues as somehow "peripheral" from "core" linguistics? Why or why not? Definitely not. Language is a form of social action and is part and parcel of culture; excluding sociocultural issues surrounding language from the 'core' undermines the whole project of understanding language. In fact, I think we can go farther: Not only is sociolinguistics a core part of linguistics, but it should also be a core part of all other subfields of linguistics. No investigation of phonology, syntax, semantics, etc. is complete if it does not take the sociocultural context into account. There are practical reasons for avoiding this too. I'm not sure if you've heard this before, but there's another saying between 'hyphenated' and 'unhyphenated' linguists which is (was? I mostly hear that from older folks I think) used as a euphemism for core/less core. And I've heard that in some departments (not the ones I've been in), linguists divide themselves into cliques based on hyphenated vs unhyphenated, and the two groups have a poor relationship with each other. I think that's a horrible culture to foster. The attitude that sociolinguistics is less 'core' also encourages departments to hire fewer sociolinguists than other subfields, and that has dire consequences on several fronts. For example, sociolinguists are usually at the forefront when it comes to communicating linguistics to members of the public other than conlanging/language learning geeks. Sociolinguistics classes are also, in my experience, much more attractive to undergrads (including those who don't major in linguistics) than other subfields because they're much more closely relevant to students' lives. And finally, sociolinguists' research is frequently much more immediately applicable in bringing about positive social change. So an attitude that sees sociolinguistics as less important to the overall field of linguistics is not just narrow-minded, but undermines a lot of the impact that linguistics departments have on the real world.
There are several sub specialties in linguistics. It sounds like you are talking about syntax. Maybe searching for "syntax" and the language you want to study for work.   Also I like Langfocus on YouTube to learn examples of grammatical constructions and history.  I like John McWhorter's books about linguistics for a general look/explainer but not a thorough textbook.
[On the intelligibility of fast synthesized speech for individuals with early-onset blindness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228440880_On_the_intelligibility_of_fast_synthesized_speech_for_individuals_with_early-onset_blindness) Related topic, deals with synthesized speech in particular.
In my experience (L2 learner of French, probably around C1 proficiency), Present Day French doesn’t keep the schwa in careful pronunciation so much as in specific contexts. Singing and poetry recital are two of the most common  contexts in which you’ll often hear the schwa. As a classic example, in the French version of the children’s rhyme « Frère Jaques »—which l learnt by rote as a child both in English and in French (but didn’t make the connection until I began learning French as an adult)—the name of the titular character is four syllables. It has to be for the rhythm to hold—but of course most people would not classify a children’s rhyme as being particularly careful speech. Now, one thing you *will* see in more carefully spoken French is an increased use of liaison. Certain instances of liaison in French are compulsory, but many are optional and only surface in formal or otherwise careful speech. Because an underlying schwa “blocks” liaison, they *will* sometimes become apparent in careful speech. However, in my experience I think it would be rather odd to actually pronounce them outside of a few specific contexts.
Influence from other languages can cause changes in syllable structure, but it can happen completely on its own within languages.  It's a pretty natural consequence of sound change that some languages end in vowels more and others in consonants.  If you just take English as an example, a whole bunch of words that used to end in vowels no longer do, because schwas at the ends of words were dropped.  This is where the "silent E" of words like *time* and *hate* comes from.  In Modern English, many varieties have eliminated /r/ and /l/ from the ends of syllables so that words like *far* and *bowl* end in vowels.  Some varieties of AAVE take it even further and delete a bunch of other consonants like /t/, /d/, and /n/. Things don't necessarily have to cycle between ending in consonants and ending in vowels because other changes are possible - /'kazo/ > /kaz/ is likely, but so is /'kazo/ > /kao/, and the same goes for /'kazog/ > /'kazo/ compared to /'kazog/ > /kazg/.  Given a long enough timeline, though, there is likely going to be a shift in how common closed and open final syllables are in any given language.
No one is right all the time.  We all have some ideas that are mistaken; this isn’t a question of linguistics, but of human nature. Part of learning to learn is figuring out how to handle sources that aren’t entirely reliable, corroborating what you can.
I'm curious why you want your child to be fully exposed to every IPA sound though?  The third one I would say Arabic, I mean there is for sure another language that may be more diverse in this situation, but I think Arabic is probably useful and add some diversity to your... portfolio?
First of all, not all Paraguayans speak Guarani. But even those who speak it will possibly struggle to understand most of the Brazilian toponyms that are (based) in Ancient Tupi ("tupi antigo"). There is a phylogenetic relationship between these languages, but modern Guarani is a completely different language. \[It is important to remember, though, that most toponyms that we recognize nowadays as being in Tupi were just made up by non-indigenous people in the 19th century. The idea was to "value the indigenous heritage" (up to a certain degree, of course) and to favor Tupi (instead of Portuguese) as a real Brazilian language. A very romantic idea...\]
I guess verbs are slightly agglutinative.  For example in می‌خورم (I eat) the root would be خور and the affixes would be می‌ (imperfect) and م (first person). If you change the prefix می‌ to the prefix ب it changes to subjuntive but you keep the same first person prefix. There is no fusion of affixes here like in most Indo-European languages. I don't mean that it is highly agglutinative, but it has some agglutination.
“I see” said the blind man in the deaf man’s ear as the lame man jumped for joy. When I was a kid this was a popular reaction to nonsensical information.
In classical Arabic, the letter that is now called "Sin" actually made a /ʃ/ sound, and the letter now called "Shin" made a /ɬ/ sound. This was the same situation as old Biblical Hebrew letters Shin and Sin, before Sin merged with Samekh (both alphabets came from Aramaic, which also originally had thoes values for those letters). Classical Arabic didn't actually have a normal /s/ sound, so that's why Samek is the only letter that doesn't exist in Arabic. As a result, the closest sound to a regular /s/ available to Classical Arabic was emphatic /ṣ/ (before the medieval sound shift that turned ʃin into sin and ɬin into ʃin). And when languages like Greek (with aspiration vs. unaspirated distinctions) and old Semitic languages transliterate each other, there is a consistent pattern of rendering unaspirated consonants with pharyngealized consonants and aspirated ones with normal consonants, which would explain the emphatic T of falastin.
There’s not really a reason to expect any given phoneme to remain in place forever, especially one with as small a functional load as /ʊə/.
The problem is that a given relatively short text does not necessarily exhibit the same word frequencies as a huge sample of English texts. Zipf's law is statistical in its nature, so it should be observed on larger samples (i.e. millions of words, whereas the article on Linguistics has only about 9,000). To simplify, it's useless to rank words by frequency in, say, a single sentence, e.g. "I have a car". All words here are different and have the same frequency (1). The sample is too small.
The reliability of Wiktionary (or Wikipedia for that matter) depends on the sources being used and cited. For some languages, Wiktionary uses some well-known etymological dictionaries as its source and tends to be quite exhaustive regarding the information, citing opposing views etc.
Just speculation on my part, but I guess it's because of the Galician-Portuguese continuum. In Galician "vós" is still the second person plural and the verb conjugation in some areas matches that of Portuguese.

I'm hoping someone knows what I'm talking about before I start diving through hundreds of grammars. I'm looking for a grammar of a Sino-Tibetan language that I *think* was posted somewhere here in r/linguistics in the last 3ish years. The thing that stood out to me was the verbal "inflection," which was mostly/entirely in its own, phonologically independent word that followed the verb and was composed of nothing but inflectional material, like they were syntatically dependent/phonological independent "anticlitics" or like an auxiliary verb construction where the auxiliary itself had completely disappeared leaving just a cluster of inflectional material bound to each other but no base (both my comparisons). There was also something notable about its classification system, I think it was prefixed to most nouns and more detailed than a typical gender system, but I don't remember much about it. (u/dom, u/keyilan)
Yeah, good luck with that.
Cool how “frah” means woman

*Forgive* and *sin* also have germanic roots.
Italian has distinctive consonant length (there are geminate consonants in medial position and also word-initial syntactic doubling in certain contexts) but no phonemic vowel length distinction.
You need to make sure they're interpreting you right. I've noticed a lot of British people will interpret pronouncing the 'r' as a long /a:/ sound and deny that they aren't saying the r in words.
Phoneme-grapheme relation is not a peculiarity of the language. It's a peculiarity of writing systems. It's safe to first distinguish the structure of the language from its writing system. The language can exist without a writing system, but writing systems need languages to exist. Writing systems are in fact an invention. Then, I doubt that languages without what you call 'exceptions' even exist. Languages have syncretism, feature-driven mechanisms, defective paradigms, syntactic ambiguities, etc.
Calling children mama and baba is very common in Arabic as well.
They have plenty of slang, and new words are invented all the time.  “Imma” isn’t even really slang, it’s just a contraction of “I’m gonna” which is a contraction of “I am going to”. Eastern European languages never had a need for such a contraction, because they never used five syllables to express this concept to begin with. But informal contractions like Polish sobie->se or trzeba->trza do exist.
Brits have more salt wealth saved through chronically under-salting their food; this is a verbal way of flaunting said wealth.
Speaking proto-germanic is not very feasible.  You will however find lots of resources for Anglo-Saxon (Old English) and Old Norse - both well documented and with lots of stuff for learners.  The dates of attestation are later than proto-germanic (for which we have no useful attestation - all we have really are reconstructions and you won't find any resources to learn its practical use). So I'd choose OE or ON.
A sentence could go on infinitely, no problem (descriptive). In formal written English, there are style conventions about how long a sentence *should* be (prescriptive).
Deosil or sunwise, and widdershins were the English equivalents of clockwise and counterclockwise. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widdershins
If you want IPA, which I suggest, it should be: /ɹʊts ɹɪˈmeɪn/ I confess that I don't know XSAMPA.  Any other system of phonetic transcription is arbitrary.
a language can be learned for the first time by having a native speaker point to objects and name them.
Some monopthongs seem to be somewhat challenging for native English speakers, and Spanish is full of them. Words ending with “e” often become “ei” (elefantei, grandei) and “o” becomes “ou” (tacous, Méxicou). This has always fascinated me because we (Spanish speakers) have the opposite problem when speaking English.

What's the point of TRYING to talk properly instead of sounding like a lazy freak? What's the answer?
Not dropped in Ireland, where “ye” is widely used as an informal second person plural. E.g. “How are ye?” Pronounced with a long “ee” (rhymes with pee) .  Sometimes even extended to corresponding possessive adjective, as in “I don’t want to go to my house. Let’s go to yeer house instead”.  Don’t know if that’s the “ye” that OP brought up, or a more recent invention. Many groups have felt English is deficient in that department. “You guys” fills the same gap in general American English.
In (South) Korean, for "ancient" Chinese people (prescriptively, for people before the Xinhai revolution in 1911), the Sino-Korean pronunciation is used: * 孔子 (Confucious, Mandarin *Kongzi*, born 551 BCE) -> Sino-Korean 공자 *Gongja* * 朱熹 (Zhu Xi, born 1130 CE) -> Sino-Korean 주희 *Juhui* * 李秀成 (Li Xiucheng, born 1823 CE) -> Sino-Korean 이수성 *Isuseong* For "modern" people, Mandarin transliteration is most commonly used, although there are some exceptions. For people who are in the "middle", who lived through the Xinhai revolution, both Sino-Korean and Mandarin transliteration are commonly used: * 习近平 (Xi Jinping, born 1953 CE) -> Mandarin translit. 시진핑 *Sijinping*, almost never Sino-Korean 습근평 *Seupgeunpyeong* * 胡锦涛 (Hu Jintao, born 1942 CE) -> Mandarin translit. 후진타오 *Hujintao*, almost never Sino-Korean 호금도 *Hogeumdo* * 子瑜 (Tzuyu, Mandarin *Ziyu*, born 1999 CE) -> Mandarin translit. 쯔위 *Jjeuwi*, never Sino-Korean 자유 *Jayu*. But * 成龍 (Jackie Chan, Mandarin *Cheng Long*, born 1954) -> Sino-Korean 성룡 *Seongryong*, never Mandarin translit. 청롱 *Cheonglong* * 周潤發 (Chow Yun-fat, Mandarin *Zhou Runfa*, born 1955) -> Sino-Korean 주윤발 *Ju Yunbal*, almost never Mandarin translit. 저우룬파 *Jeoulunpa* Also * 蔣介石 (Chiang Kai-shek, Mandarin *Jiang Jieshi*, born 1887 CE) -> Sino-Korean 장개석 *Janggaeseok*, but also Mandarin Translit. 장제스 *Jangjeseu*. * 周恩来 (Zhou Enlai, born 1898 CE) -> Sino-Korean 주은래 *Jueunlae*, but also Mandarin Translit. 저우언라이 *Jeoueonlai*.
I speak Swedish & i think it means “hill view of Horsens and the inlet/fjord”.  Lid= an old word for slope/hill. This is the only part I’m not sure about, but it’s my best guess. Sigt = sight/view. Över is the proper preposition in this context where English would prefer “of”. Horsens is a town in Denmark. Og = och = and. Fjorden = the inlet. Horsens has a pretty prominent fjord. To my knowledge you only see og in danish & norwegian, so I’d bet this is archaic Danish. PS DNA results are not precise enough to truly distinguish between populations as closely related as Dutch, danish, and German. Also I’m not sure how easily you’re expecting Danish to flow from your tongue but it is a notoriously gravelly language. I wouldn’t have high glossal expectations.
In Russian it depends on the name. Some names sound perfectly fine changed (e.g. Джон (John), it's masculine and ends in a consonant). Я дам Джону поесть (I will let John eat/I will give food to John (John here is in dative))  Names with unusual endings won't be changed at all (e.g. names ending "и" (ee)) Давай, скажи Генри (Go ahead, tell Henry(dative))  In fact, in Russian we have a distinct category of foreign loan nouns that don't change their form according to the case. Some examples would be кофе (coffee), кенгуру (kangaroo), такси (taxi), or метро (metro)
I think you can best see the difference in clitics like English genetive 's. It can go anywhere, even attaching to the end of relative clauses. It is thus morphologically independent. But phonologically it's part of whatever it's attached to.
[The History of English](https://historyofenglishpodcast.com/) podcast is fantastic if you are interested in the history of the English language. It's essentially a *long* series of lectures and the host starts all the way back at Proto-Indo-European. He's currently on episode 154 and is just now getting to the shift from Middle English to early Modern English, so it's fairly in-depth and involves a lot of the history.
The general consensus among linguists is that Valencian is the southern variety of the Catalan-Valencian dialect continuum. Indeed it's very similar to the other Catalan dialects, especially those spoken in western Catalonia. Most likely what happened is that during the Reconquista period Catalan gradually spread south as the Muslim lands were conquered by the Crown of Aragon and partially settled by Catalan speaking Christian people. The same happened all over the Iberian peninsula, so you can see how Galician-Portuguese and Leonese spread south in the west, Castillian in the center, while Aragonese and Catalan in the east.
I would say 'beautiful' is very prevalent. Linda, Bella, Belle, Jameela etc...

The concept of a parent language in your definition is quite problematic. How would you define it?
Hell no. First off, I wouldn't call Arabic varieties "different languages", mutual intelligiblity exists on a spectrum that's for certain but it really isn't hard at all to quickly learn another dialect. I am Tunisian and I can understand every Arabic dialect from Western Algeria to Eastern Syria with no issues, I might struggle a bit with a few words here and there in Moroccan, Iraqi and Yemeni but I also can understand them pretty well. It is unfourtenly the case that we (Arabs) tend to over-exggerate our dialectical differences a lot. Now to the matter in question, I don't see any reason to standarize dialects in the Arab world. MSA is not spoken by anyone as a native language, it thus works as an equilizer, everyone has to make an effort to learn it no matter their native dialect. Now imagine we are to standarize the dialect of each country, which variety would we pick ? Let's take Tunisia as an example, it is almost certain the dialect of the capital Tunis would be adopted. Now, someone from Tunis would grow up speaking the offical language while I (as a person of mixed Southern and Sahelian origin) would have to adjust to a new offical variety. How did this solve anything for me ? At least MSA is dead as a native language and no one tries to push it to be a first language as a result, but why wouldn't Arab states attempt to push their new (widely spoken) central dialects in the name of "centralization" ? Your question assumes each country has one dialect when the fact of the matter is each Arab country has countless different dialects. Eastern Syria for instance has a dialect closer to Iraq than to the rest of Syria, border regions in the Maghreb share basically the exact same dialects, Northern Jordan and Southern Syria have the same dialect, in Coastal Syria Sunnis and Alawites have different varities of their Coastal dialect and Christians speak a completely different dialect more similar to Damascus ...  Regions have distinct dialects, sects have distinct dialects, the rural and urban regions in the same region have distinct dialects, MSA did a pretty good job at preserving them, standarized dialects would only kill them. For those reasons I think MSA should continue to be the offical variety in all Arab countries and in all Arabic speaking communities and I am absolutely fine with (and in fact supportive) of the current status quo.

I don't think many people learn it unless they take linguistics courses or classes that focus on accents, like ESL or possibly acting classes.
Your to go source for these types of questions is wiktionary.com . The entry there says that cipolla and cebolla come from Latin cēpulla ‘little onion’, which is a diminutive of cēpa ‘onion’. Which itself is a  loanword from an unknown, possibly substrate, language. Perhaps related to Ancient Greek κάπια (kápia, “onions”), Albanian qepë and Welsh cenhinen (“leek”).
As far as I understand it, it simply means, that the shape of the letters resemble the shape of the thing that makes the sound. So even though ㄹ depicts different sounds, your tongues placement is still similar and therefore it’s shape is true to it’s pronunciation.

Of these, only **창조성**  really has an English equivalent that refers to a characteristic of language broadly: it means *productivity*. We say that human language is productive because a finite number of units can be combined in infinite permutations to say new things and express new ideas never expressed before. **언어의 사회성** refers to a fact about language that is generally understood to be true in sociolinguistics, but that does not really have an exact equivalent in English. It basically means that language exists in a social setting; language norms and meanings are socially constructed as a kind of tacit "agreement" within a society or social group. An individual cannot generally *enforce* decisions about those language norms, but individuals and bodies/institutions have the power to *influence* those norms depending on their social standing. (A good example is the "correct" pronunciation of words. A lot of people pronounce many words differently, but very often we believe that one way of saying it is "correct" while others are "wrong". But this perception is socially constructed, and different people have different ideas about what is correct or wrong. Perhaps the closest equivalent would be "the socially constructed nature of language", but that sounds more sociological than linguistic, in my opinion.) **언어의 역사성** is similar in not having an English equivalent. It means something like, "the historicity of language" -- that it has existed and been transmitted over many generations. In the process, it undergoes changes on all levels of organisation (phonetics, phonology, morphosyntax, semantics, etc.) while also gaining and losing words. This is tied to 언어의 사회성: individuals do not make conscious decisions about these changes; rather, these changes occur naturally and gradually throughout the 역사 of the language. **언어의 자의성** on its own means "the arbitrariness of language". We don't generally say that *language* is arbitrary. Rather, you typically hear people say *the signs* or *the forms* of language are arbitrary, so the corresponding noun-phrase would be *arbitrariness of sign*. That is to say that a word is pronounced a certain way just as a matter of fact; it does not need to correspond to any inherent characteristic of the thing it describes. There is no "logical" reason why a "cat" in English is a "고양이" in Korean. The way these words sound has no relation at all to the concept of a cat. I hope this helps! :)
As I remember the exchange, Bilbo was trying to get him to leave without being openly hostile and just kept saying "Good morning" with different implications (such as using it to mean "goodbye).  This lack of cooperation is what Gandalf was pointing out.
It doesn’t quite make sense to ask what are the vowels of Middle Chinese (assume Early Middle Chinese here, EMC henceforth).  EMC is usually reconstructed in a final-based (finals are called 韵母 yùnmǔ in Chinese) manner, so it really depends on the expertise of the linguist.  For example, Edwin Pulleyblank has some weirdest reconstructions that you’ll see, because he’s really into the theory of CV phonology.  You need to compare different systems to see how historical linguists explain things differently.  [This Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Chinese_finals) is not the most useful, since it only presents the systems of Karlgren, Li Rong, Pulleyblank, Zhengzhang, and Baxter (I don’t know who that Abraham Chan guy is, and the reconstruction looks terrible), but it’s a good starting point if you don’t read Chinese.
What do you mean by “signs” and “ideology?” Both are very multipurpose words.

Initial /ŋ/ is surprisingly rare in Indo-European, and even other instances are usually the result of /n/ assimilating to a following velar. So uncommon that there doesn't seem to be a dedicated symbol for the sound in any of the major scripts that wasn't just derived from another letter.
As a huge Stormlight Archive fan, I'd say yes it's probably realistic, although it does depend exactly what you're asking.  So Navani hears the words spoken by Dalinar in Dawnchant, and writes down the sounds. If I remember those scenes correctly – and please correct me if I'm wrong – it either doesn't tell us which script she transcribes them in or it says she did it in women's script? Assuming it's women's script, as that's the only one we know Navani can use, then what probably happened is Navani used women's script letters that are USUALLY used for Alethi sounds to instead write down Dawnchant sounds. Since Dawnchant is thousands of years old and possibly not even related to Alethi at all, the sound systems might be entirely different. In that case a lot of sound distinctions might be lost when Navani transcribes. We don't have any reason to suspect Navani has phonological or linguistic training.  When you say "it seems unrealistic to me that she would be able to accurately figure out what words are being spoken," – by "words" do you mean the sounds of the words or the meanings of the words? It's likely that even though the language is old Navani will still be able to transcribe most of the sounds pretty well. But no, she won't have any idea what they mean when she's writing them. Remember, women's script is phonetic – you write sounds. Glyphs you write meaning. It would be much harder to transcribe a foreign language with glyphs than with women's script.  If your question is whether they would be close to translating the language as a whole *before* Dalinar tells her what he said in Alethi, the answer is a definitive NO. But if you're asking would they be able to translate the language *after* they have the Dawnchant sounds matched up with their meanings, then they would know a lot of the language, considering how much time Dalinar spent speaking Dawnchant and being recorded. So that's a *possible* yes. Tell me if I'm misunderstanding though.
Fromkin (1971) [http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/dm/bp/fromkin71-speech-errors.pdf](http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/dm/bp/fromkin71-speech-errors.pdf) section 3.5 offered an argument for the /ng/ analysis from their separation in speech errors, e.g. for Chuck Young \[tʃʌk jʌŋ\] (13b) the speaker produced \[tʃʌŋk jʌg\]. And for "cut the string" (13d) the speaker produced \[kʌnt ðə strɪg\]. If \[ŋ\] is /ng/, then such cases are explained by transposition of the /n/. But this could be analyzed as \[nasal\] feature transposition instead.
In my personal experience, no. Both of my parents are from foreign countries (Ecuador and Germany) and have lived in the US for 20 years. They still speak flawless Spanish and German.
There are plenty of nitty-gritty "wars" taking place if you will, both between and within the functional and generative schools. The bigger issue, IMHO, is the pervasive belief that much of sociolinguistics is apologetic work or community service without much intellectual merit.

That is Balkan nationalist nonsense. This is a manipulated version of the fact that Church Slavonic and Old Church Slavonic are derived from a Slavic language spoken in Eastern Balkans (called Old Bulgarian by some). Not a single other Slavic language derives from OCS/CS, but Slavic languages of ethnic groups with significant Eastern Orthodox populations get a lot of loanwords from OCS, that sometimes replace their native cognates, the most affected one probably being Russian. Orthodox Christianity spread northwards from Greece (and to do it, it had to go through Bulgaria, bringing to East and some South Slavs serious amounts of OCS vocabulary), but hundreds of years earlier the Slavic languages spread out from their Urheimat roughly in modern Eastern Ukraine to spread in all directions way before the Turkic Bulgars settled modern Bulgaria and merged with the local Slavs, losing their native Turkic language. Are Bulgarian and Proto-Slavic mutually intelligible? Not significantly more than any other Slavic language is with Proto-Slavic. Your Bulgarian friend confused Proto-Slavic with Church Slavonic.

Those are a bit of an edge case, in that that that doesn't behave quite like a separate phoneme - attaching one of these to the end of a word doesn't change it into a different word; rather, they're much more like paralinguistic modifications to words.
The international phonetic alphabet is designed to represent all the possible sounds of human language.  There's lots of quibbling about the details, but if you want to answer the question, "what does this word sound like?" That's the gold standard for linguistic science. Some words are difficult to translate because some concepts are expressed by a word in one language, but in a book in others.  Tao is a Chinese religious and philosophical concept that has occupied people for centuries and translating it as "way" is incredibly limiting. Even a simple word, like "family" can means different things in different languages and cultures.  Is it your nuclear family, your extended family?  Your tribe, your clan? Those things that are most important to you?
bit of a cheat answer but, Jeju.
[Chryso Pelekani](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/dir/en/component/comprofiler/userprofile/cpelek01) is the main scholar working on Cypriot Gurbet and will be no doubt familiar with the linguistic situation of the broader region, so I think contacting her will be a good start.

The main two phonetic transcriptions systems you can find in British English are the ones used by Cambridge and Oxford. Oxford uses /ɛ/, wheres Cambridges uses /e/. The same happens with other sounds: Oxford: a Cambridge: æ In this link you'll find the main differences: https://media.pronunciationstudio.com/2021/09/IPA-comparison-table-oxford-cambridge-800x889.png
The 17th-century was a long time in the history of English!  English in 1601 was very different from English in 1700.  But since you also specify "Shakespeare's time", and Shakespeare died in 1616, that narrows it down a little. Most sources from the early seventeenth century give conservative pronunciations that retain the  Middle English palatal, velar (or uvular) fricatives.  Examples include Owen, *Key to the Spanish Tongue* (1605) and Gil, *Logonomia* (1619 and 1620). Exceptions are found from a few East Anglian sources, suggesting that this area is where the loss of the fricatives originated.  One example is provided by the Suffolk school-teacher Coote. In his *English School-master* (1596), Coote writes that written *gh* "is of most men but little sounded", and that in word final written *gh* "some countries sound them fully, others not at all".  He also states that the pronounciation of *daughter* without the fricative is "the barbarous speech of your country people". All information taken from Dobson, *English Pronunciation 1500-1700*, vol ii, p. 985-988.
transitive and intransitive verbs, not sure if there are third categories in other languages, but none that i know of
There really isn't much difference. There are some places with non-russian population (like Dagestan), but they just speak different language besides Russian. But if we are talking about like Moscow and Vladivostok than no, pretty much the same language with no variations. I live in Voronezh (pretty much the boarder with Ukraine) and served in army on the Kunashir island (border with Japan) and there were no communication problems whatsoever, even though we had like 20 different ethnic groups in one building
Basically any biblical commentary analyzes both the original language (usually Greek or Hebrew, but occasionally Aramaic) and the philosophy behind the translation. You'd have to be more specific about your religious goals. Perhaps you should find a sub that reflects your religious beliefs and ask this question there: Once again, any reputable commentary analyzes the language.
There is plenty of Arabic influence on Spanish for this reason
What is your question? You have successfully broken *ninasoma* into morphemes. One of them (the root) signifies reading, and the others (affixes) signify person and tense.
there's many ways languages can develop new phonemes. just to illustrate, one of the common ways is that conditioned allophones of sounds lose their conditioning environment and the allophonic variation becomes a phonemic distinction. I can give you a nice example: proto-west-germanic used to have */mu:s/ and */mu:si/ for the words mouse and mice.  later, by the time of old english, the /u/ in the plural form was fronted to /y/ (a phenomenon known as umlaut), leading to /mu:s/ and /my:si/.  then, the plural ending was lost, leading to /mu:s/ and /my:s/. at this point, we have an entirely new vowel phoneme with the minimal pair above.
I guess if you really wanted to, you could interpret «the sleeping cat» as either a real living cat or some kind of cat shaped teddy bear, which helps someone sleep. «My son brings his sleeping cat to bed every night». It’s a bit of a stretch, but I guess that is one way there could be some semantic difference, as I find it hard to interpret «the cat that is sleeping» in any kind of similar alternative way. Although I guess in my example «sleeping cat» would be a compound, whereas it would generally be seen as a noun with an adjective in the original post?🤷‍♂️
[Language attrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_attrition) is an observed phenomenon, but it is by no means a linear or inevitable process.  For one, in this day and age "no access to your native language at all" is only theoretically possible, but very much not an easy feat. You will have to go out of your way to *avoid* encountering your native language even when moving abroad.
Linguistics is (on the whole) descriptive, not prescriptive. It isn't linguists' job to tell people how to use language; they merely study how people do use it. So in answer to your question: no, it's unlikely that linguists will have "sorted this out". In any case, if they decided to do this, what would they base their decision on? English doesn't have any official authority that governs pronunciation. The nearest to a solution would be to consult dictionaries, but even there, you will generally find the pronunciations that people use rather than those that lexicographers think people should use. For what it's worth: in my own career, I have heard "char" (like the synonym for "scorch") very frequently, "car" occasionally and "care" never. (Some American English dialects pronounce "carry" identically to "Kerry" and "Carey" (all rhyming with "fairy"), but these are distinct in my dialect, British English. The start of "character" would be /kær/ for me, but words cannot end in /ær/ in my dialect.) So based solely on my own experience, the most usual pronunciation is "char". EDIT: spelling
This varies somewhat across accents, but it’s definitely not unusual for a final /z/ to be realized as a fully devoiced [s]. The way it will vary from a regular /s/ will be typically by the length of the preceding sonorants (vowel or vowel+/m,n,r,l/). So, for example, “falls”>[fɔːɫz̥~fɔːɫs] vs. “false”>[fɔˑɫs]. There might be some distinction on the relative intensity of the final [s] as well (with the one in “false” being longer, more breathy, and higher pitched), but the length of the preceding sonorants seems to be the main cue. Note that it’s actually pretty neat, because sonorants are the only category of sounds in English that can be followed by either /z/ or /s/. The remaining sounds (basically plosives and other fricatives) can be followed only by one of them: codas like */gs/ or */kz/ are disallowed, for example.
>I can‘t find clear lines dividing them That's because there aren't any. "Language family" is a broad term that applies to any group of languages descended from a common ancestor. Language families can be contained within other families. "Group" and "subgroup" likewise, it's all relative. The distinction between "language" and "dialect" is very fuzzy.  One term that might be useful is "primary language family," which is sometimes used for families like Indo-European that have no known relatives.
I don't have personal experience with the language but I've heard that modern Icelandic has changed very little from Old Norse, partially due to geography and partially due to intentional cultural preservation efforts. Apparently the Poetic Edda, circa 1200-1300 C.E., is quite readable to modern speakers although a bit oddly phrased.
Does anybody know if/how x-bar theory accounts for Austronesian alignment? I'd expect that any formulation of the sort could be used as an argument that DPs precede NPs, since 'ang' and 'ng' in Tagalog for instance seem more significant for understanding the entire sentence compared to determiners in English, but I'm a layman who's hardly familiar with these things.
* Traditional Dublin was at least partly non-rhotic iiuc. * All non-rhotic cities in England formerly spoke a rhotic English: consequently, having rhotic ingredients doesn't create a particular expectation of a rhotic product - whatever social pressures existed to spread non-rhoticity were capable of suppressing rhoticity, and they were spreading _at about that time_ - non-rhoticity was fashionable. * In general, I would have expected that in the choice between an innovative/new feature and a conservative one, new accents would prefer the new feature. However, I have no specific basis for this. * One significant finding from sociolinguistics is that innovations often travel from city to city, so it would have been natural for Liverpool to adopt non-rhoticity
You can search this sub. This topic comes up every week or so. Sorry answer: most linguists think the might be very tiny effects on cognition, but only a few believe language had any considerable effect on thought.
You can't ethically perform an experiment like this on people. An experiment like this has been done on birds, I think, but I couldn't give you a resource.
I believe there is a Judeo-Persian language(s) that is currently spoken.   Just googled a source its not really great looking to me but it links to other sources that look okay so I assume it’s not godawful but I’m merely an anth major so I can’t really tell.   https://omniglot.com/writing/judeopersian.htm
Regarding the *adjacency* part: The mapping from a tree structure to a string is often referred to as linearization in syntax, pioneered by Richard Kayne in his book *The Antisymmetry of Syntax* (see the relevant sections in *Understanding Minimalism* for a more friendly introduction).  Basically, the idea is that (asymmetric) c-commanding over a tree structure maps to linear precedence over a string.  Of course, you can also linearize each treelet differently rather than having a homomorphism, but that’s beside the point.  Remember that empty strings are valid in a tree structure.  It is totally possible that a movement results in an empty string in the original V position, and (the overt) V and O are no longer “adjacent” in the phonetic form thanks to that. I don’t think you need constituency tests to justify that V and O are a constituent in syntax.  Such a structure maps elegantly to semantic interpretation in terms of lambda calculus, that alone is a good enough argument (constituency itself is a theory-internal notion in the first place).  But if you do need constituency tests, ellipsis may be easier to do than movement.  Movement tests seem to result in [freezing effects](https://doi.org/g6kt) in VSO/OSV languages (not exactly sure about that, since I don’t have enough experience with VSO/OSV languages).
In the case of *mismo* with **s^z**, it means this is an 's' but it transitions into a 'z' near the end of the sound.  This happens when a speaker doesn't synchronize the change down in the vocal cords from voiceless to voiced and the change in the mouth configuration from **s** to **m**.  So there's some "anticipatory" voicing on the s sound right before the m. I think the h with a caret is supposed to be a voiced (or "breathy") h.
They were most similar to Bulgarian/Macedonian. Old Church Slavonic was based on the Old Bulgarian spoken around Thessaloniki, and Middle Bulgarian was the main language of the Second Bulgarian Empire which controlled much of modern day Greece during the Middle Ages.
It would be an incoherent mess.
*Have* is quickly being replaced by *of* in speech and writing in British English because people can’t wrap their heads around *’ve*.
How's your Perl?  Python?
I'm reminded strongly of Iyaric, the speech used by members of the RastafarI faith, which should be familiar to anyone who listens to any Jamaican-influenced music. This is an argot. Like all argots, its purpose is to distinguish in-group from out-group — what's more cynically called "virtue signaling". Its use cultivates loyalty, familiarity and a mindfulness of membership in in-group members, and cultivates confusion and alienation among out-group members that hear it. Argots are extremely common in groups that demand strong loyalty and a certain amount of secrecy and distance from the surrounding world: gangs, new religious movements, fraternal orders, and professional guilds often have them. Freemasonry has an extensive glossary of special insider's terms. So does the KKK. The former is mostly repurposed and redefined medieval stoneworkers' guilds' jargon. The latter is a lot of ridiculous sounding neologisms that all start with K. (They call their treasurer the "Kladd". Yeah.)

Among the many names this trait has, the most common one(I think) is "self-reciprocal kinship" and it's also found in Arabic and probably many more languages
As far as I'm aware, this is perfectly normal and expected. Vowels occupy a fuzzy space around an abstract target point, and those fuzzy spaces can overlap fairly significantly. When a given vowel is pronounced in one of those overlapping spaces, listeners use context-based expectations to automatically infer what underlying phoneme the speaker was likely intending to pronounce - i.e. they ask 'of the possible phonemes I might have heard, which results in a word that's sensible in context?', and then they infer it must have been whichever phoneme answers that question. These inference processes are so automatic that it can take some fairly carefully engineered circumstances to interfere enough with them for listeners to consciously recognise that a given ambiguous vowel was in fact ambiguous. I am not a phonetician in the least, but the graph you've presented looks very much like graphs I've seen in various contexts over the years. I don't think I'd worry too much about having the overlaps you do there.
To give you search terms,  "opaque orthography" or "deep orthography" are more common terms for what you're looking for like in the paper title "[Predictors of Reading in Urdu: Does Deep Orthography Have an Impact?](https://doi.org/10.1002/dys.1474)"

There's a bit of "vulgar" Greek left, mainly in dramatic texts, yes. Attic comedies use "lower" language than legal speeches.
> My aim is to find a piece of text that contains the most basic and used terms in a language  I think this is a misconception about the purpose of the Swadesh list - it isn’t a list of the most commonly used words in a language.

yes, automated cognate detection algorithms are getting far better (accuracy topping out around 90%), and there's ongoing work on automated reconstruction. There's a good recent review [here](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/article/10.5334/johd.12/)
"Words" in English are determined by speakers. Dictionaries can decide whether or not to include them, but there is no authority endued with the authority to decide what is and what isn't a word. And yes, ***paucity*** is a word, even though *you* don't use it.
“Chomsky presents the Minimalist Program as a *program*, not as a theory, following Imre Lakatos's distinction.” [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalist_program) I'd say that's how it's established nowadays, considering this is the most recent development of his work.
Indian here, not a linguist though.  In Indian languages like Hindi, one can say " Ek Baar" which translates to "One time" or "Once" at the end of a statement (or even at the beginning of the sentence) to add a degree of persuasion. For example, one can say "Koshish karo, Ek Baar" which roughly can be translated to "Do try, (at least) once". This is probably carried over into Indian English.  Hindi is an Indo European language but I can also observe this in Tamil and Kannada, two Dravidian languages that I speak. Here the equivalent phrases are "Oru vaati" in Tamil and "Ondu Sala" in Kannada.
I always assumed that the "yeah" was to recognize the question asked, and the "no" was in response to said question.
Because in classical Greek it was Θῆβαι. Thebes would be a Latinized plural. β used to be pronounced /b/. Why do you think people talk about software having "beta" versions rather than "vita" versions?
I'd say most of the time, but not always. For example, BAlcony in Italian is pronounced balCOne, funnily enough it did use to be pronounced balCOny. In the US a lot of people get the stress wrong in Hispanic surnames, they say GUZmán, instead of guzMÁN, or péREZ instead of PÉrez,etc.
G-dropping has lasted centuries so.... yeah  (Also I hate that name, nothing is being dropped)
Contact-induced change can easily happen between just about any pair or group of languages, given the right social conditions. This is where we get things like linguistic areas, where languages from several different families have similar typological profiles due to centuries of contact between them. It happens all the time.
Polish has "toć", which functions differently but carries the same energy as "duh".

Not having a universally consistent definition doesn't mean a term is not useful.
Morse code and binary already cover this, no?
It's probably not mentioned because the explanation for why it needs to be "I" in one case and "me" in another is kind of convoluted. That's where the lack of (overt) cases becomes a problem: on the surface, the difference looks arbitrary. Explaining why there is a difference every time is a hassle and makes you seem bossy. So people just ignore it when someone uses the "wrong" one because, well, it's not like the sentence becomes unintelligible. It's pretty weird for speakers of case-heavy languages because we can see the difference between the two words more easily, yeah. But I expect both forms to become acceptable in the near future - languages change.
I think they were taking the mick, Wikipedia and various legal dictionaries all say the “v” is for “versus”.
Languages can be stress timed (stressed syllables are longer than the rest) and they can be syllable timed (every syllable should be about the same duration). If a speaker of arabic (syllable timed) speaks a stress timed language like English, this effect can happen if that speaker isn't very proficient yet. It's one of the things an L2 speaker may have picked up on or not
I‘m not sure this analysis makes sense, because removing the article doesn‘t turn it into a vocative, it‘s just that nouns in the voxative case do not have an article, i.e. this doesn‘t just apply to names.  Using articles with names is also standard in Catalan and also happens in colloquial Spanish and Portuguese. I think I‘ve also seen it in Italianand French but I might be mistaken.
It sort of depends on whether you want to apply tube models or perturbation theory and what vowel you're thinking of. The 2-tube nomogram [in this document](https://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist205/index_files/Handout%206%20-%20Vowel%20acoustics.pdf) shows the relationship between the resonant frequency locations and the length of the back tube for [a]. The placement of each formant varies depending on where the constriction is and what the vowel is. [This figure](https://swphonetics.com/articulation/bell-vowel-model/150th-anniversary/perturbation-theory/) shows how the formants relate to perturbation theory. The sinusoidal waves above the midsagittal show airstream velocity. At points where there is a maximum, there is an antinode, and at points where there is a zero, there is a node. When your tongue creates a constriction at an antinode (i.e., a point of maximum velocity), the formant frequency is lowered, When your tongue creates a constriction at a node (point of maximum pressure), the formant frequency is raised. > if I should just learn the formant frequencies of vowels by heart and stop trying to infer them intuitively If you mean you're trying to infer them based on tube models or perturbation theory, yes, you probably want to stop doing that and try to just learn the frequencies because tube models and perturbation theory are not really amenable to intuitive reasoning (as opposed to explicit modeling) based on how many variables/concepts are at play. However, there is still an intuitive relationship to be had where the high values of F1 indicate lowness, and high values of F2 indicate frontness. Similarly, you can also look at how close together F1 and F2 are as an indication of backness. Low values of F3 often indicate a sort of rhotic sound and can sometimes indicate vowel rounding (though this sometimes shows up in F2). F4 has not been found to relate much to linguistic segments in the literature, and it is often not even reported.
It's a bit hard to help you without knowing what you've already learned.      Have you seen [complementisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementizer) and Complementiser Phrases? Those would probably be used for subordinating conjunctions, which would end up in the [specifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar_theory#Basic_Principles) of the phrase, like in the examples [here](https://www.departments.bucknell.edu/linguistics/lectures/10lect05.html) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar_theory#Structure_of_S').      For coordination, there are [different ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_\(linguistics\)#Structure_of_coordination) to represent it - either [ [X] [and] [Y] ] (flat) or a more binary structure. If you're doing this for a class, you should ask your instructor how they want you to represent these things. Otherwise, there's no right answer, exactly.
Yes, this is called the [whine-wine merger.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_of_English_%E2%9F%A8wh%E2%9F%A9)
Yes to all of your suggestions I’d say.  Consistent slurring is due to motor deficits and/or weakness, whether it’s temporary and self induced (I.e. being drunk) or permanent (I.e. dysarthria). I don’t think we can say “slurring is characterized by x, y and z” because motor weaknesses can manifest differently in different people. “Imprecise articulation” is a phrase I’d use to describe this. However I’m a speech therapist, not a linguist, so curious to hear other thoughts too!
Disregarding that PIE speakers were almost certainly not literate, and weren't using any living script if they were, virtually nothing would be intelligible. At best a few very basic words like father, moon etc...  and even then they would at best just be recognisably associated if you pointed at something and said your words for it.  Romance language speakers can't understand Latin and English speakers can't understand Old English, save for making an educated guess at the meaning of some words, many of which have drifted semantically over time. Old English was being spoken only 1000 years ago, Latin 2000 years ago (though at this point is was branching significantly in dialects) the very earliest language that people might consider PIE is: Five. Thousand. Years. Old. Half of that with zero recorded literature. So the other thing to remember is that no spoke PIE per say, its a very, VERY, rough (if educated) guess at the most likely common ancestor for words, sounds, and structures. Whatever people spoke back then it was almost certainly quite far from reconstruction, with its own dialects and accents. Edit: There's some IE family writing older than I thought. I thought the stuff that old was afroasiatic, a la semitic. My bad.

I think a term that will help you is 'receptive bilingualism'. It's a pretty common experience - for any number of reasons that people might not get practice producing a language, it's a skill of it's own that can be lost or never mastered, separately from understanding the language.
I’m not quite sure I understood your question correctly, but “The Anthropology of Names and Naming” by vom Bruck & Bodenhorn and “The Oxford Handbook of Names and Naming” seem like good places to start.
The English progressive (“be _ing”) is not necessarily habitual, nor is the simple past necessarily perfective.  The verb “watched” is not a single, bounded event - precisely the opposite in fact, as it’s stated that it occurs repeatedly every weekday after school.  If you were to omit that, it would indeed indicate a perfective action, but it does not here.

And no, Siebert's 1975 paper "Resurrecting Virginia Algonquian from the dead: The reconstituted and historical phonology of Powhatan" is not a perfect resource. He has quite a few misreadings and biases towards certain aspects, especially the treatment of PA *θ, which merged with *r in Pw. like every other Eastern language. (While it is oft spelled <t(t)>, this represents a (devoiced) flap, and it's frequently spelled <r> as well). It's the only published paper like it, but it has quite a few errors, and I'd be wary about using it in certain cases
Phonetics. English phonetics is hard, I learned (dipped my toe in)  it in french phonetics thank god XD, it wasn't required for my minor but I took it anyway. After learning the basics self teaching is easy, but I'd definitely pick up some phonetics books in your mother tongue to familiarize yourself with been IPA and and such. Learning IPA and phonetic jargon helped immensely in my interest of linguistics.

I don't work on minimalism anymore and this answer is mostly based on a conversation with Kobele. Take this with a grain of salt. One important factor is that minimalist grammars are very restrictive. Because they are properly formalized, it is very difficult to 'expand' them, but a lot of work on minimalism is about expanding the theory. This makes minimalist grammars unappealing to many minimalists. A second factor is that minimalist grammars are rather simplified when compared to minimalism proper, so many researchers don't 'recognize' the theory in them. Working on a properly formalized theory is very different from working on a partial formalism. Regarding the new Collins and Stabler formalization... I don't know.
Wir suchen dich actually means “we’re looking for you”, or “we search for you”, but I have seen the ad you’re referring to and it’s hilarious.  I guess the closer the languages are the more likely that is to happen, otherwise the comparisons between more than a couple words are just nonsense.  One funny one between Czech and Polish is šukat - szukat (pronounced the same). On Polish websites you often see “szukej” which means “search”, but in Czech that means “fuck”, as an imperative/command. It’s spelled differently but it’s well-known that SZ = Š
Certainly "lol" and "brb" are more utilitarian than "pwned" and, I would argue, "rofl." On top of that, you could (at least in part) categorize "pwned" separately since it's one based on a typo; it's intentionally misspelled and that's all it has going for it. For its part, "rofl" was pretty much just an amped up "lol" and, in my experience, was only used sparingly. I wouldn't want to blindly claim that my anecdotal experience was the rule, however.  I would also like to add that "lol" and "brb" etc were in use before texting became a thing. They simply carried over. I suppose you're not making a definite statement on that, but what you did say can be interpreted to mean that texting gave rise to this. So, it's probably best to nip that one in the bud. :)
oh absolutely, adding “[thing]core” means “[thing] aesthetic”. other examples are “nightcore”, “cottagecore”, “glitchcore”, even “traumacore”.  theres a recent little trend on tiktok called “americacore” that is just americana, but ppl use ‘-core’ to show it’s in the same category as other aesthetics that are popular on the internet (like the others listed).

The plural is indeterminate, as is the paucal (for ‘few’) which appears in many languages of the Pacific, Americas and to an extent elsewhere. Some Australian languages have a ‘superplural’ to emphasise ‘many’.  Many languages also don’t obligatorily distinguish number at all.   But I think the closest I know of to what you want might be the example of the Welsh *collective*, where words like ‘plant’ (children) and ‘coed’ (trees) are the default form and treated as the default, like a mass noun, with a singulative form plentyn (child) and coeden (tree). The former would usually be translated as a plural but are indeterminate.  Note the in practice the English plural can certainly be used the way you describe in any case: a law in general terms referring to a situation with ‘children’ or ‘trees’ would be taken to apply to a single child and single tree, and ‘no’ (zero) can take either singular or plural.

The relevant contexts are: - before final r or r+consonant - in most instances of 'wa-' - word finally when stressed with of course various exceptions that don't pattern so nicely.
Same reason it is harder to learn to dance ballet when you get older... Accent is linked to motor function; how the tongue moves, glottis status, lip movements... When we get used to certain movements it gets harder to change the routine
This is not a linguistics issue. It is a highly complex cultural/social issue. You both are right.
If you mean how *theoretical* linguistics is related to computational linguistics, well, computational linguistics is quite a broad field of study just like theoretical linguistics.  Some computational linguists are more inclined to statistical and quantitative analysis, not necessarily directly related to theoretical linguistics.  Still some other are interested in building abstract computational models directly related to formalisms in theoretical linguistics.  Think of automata theory, which is directly related to the computation of formal grammars and hence to the theory of generative grammar.  Or think of the model-theoretic formalization of the Government and Binding Theory (see the [award-winning](http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/mol/award-2017.html) *A Descriptive Approach to Language-Theoretic Complexity* by James Rogers).  These studies are as well counted as computational linguistics and highly related to the study of theoretical linguistics.
I think Sardinian, it‘s the first language who parted from the “Latin tree”
[Routledge Press](https://www.routledge.com/search?sb=SCLA01) has a lot. They'll probably skew toward the academic side, but their selection is still worth a browse.

Honestly, probably wiktionary.  Merriam-Webster has accurate AmEng pronunciations, but doesn’t print them in IPA.  Dictionary.com has IPA, but its pronunciations are really strange. It’s like they’ve set Philadelphia as their default accent or something.  A quick AmEng check is to look up the word “paradise.”  If it starts /pæɹ/, it’s not great. (The typical American pronunciation is /pɛɹ/. /pæɹ/ is highly regional in the US and common in England.)
Canadian: /ˈsɔɹ.i/, /əˈbʌʊt/ American: /ˈsɑɹ.i/, /əˈ baʊt/
It's still SVO. What you're thinking is lexical semantics, in passive voice the Agent (entity doing things) is the object and the Theme/Patient (entity things are being done to) is the subject. So yes, semantically it's flipped. But syntactically, it's still SVO.
This can occur in non-rhotic Southern US English and AAVE.

Do you mean cross-linguistically rare, or rare in that particular language (as in, low-frequency)? If you mean the latter, as a first approximation, I'd say not really: what makes a phoneme more likely to merge is for it to have rare *features*, instead of being itself rare. So, for example, /ʒ/ is a pretty rare phoneme in English, but it's just the voiced counterpart of /ʃ/, and shows no tendency whatsoever to merge as far as I'm aware. On the other hand, /θ, ð/ are pretty common in English, but are in the process of merging with /f ,v/ in many accents, most likely because they're the only dental phonemes in the language (so, the place of articulation is rare).
Just out of interest (I'm a total amateur), if you do this automated computerized approach, aren't a lot of the words you extract in a conjugated or inflected form, needing some kind of normalization?

English does have some form of V2. In some ways, the verb does stay in the second position. Apart from forming questions like what is that? We also have neither do I, so are they, etc. Obviously it’s not as extensive as German and Dutch, but it would be quite wrong to say it doesn’t have it at all. The Wiki has an article on V2. You can find more examples for English.
Abjads and Abugidas are types of writing systems, not types of languages. What language family a language belongs to has little connection to the writing system it uses. Most Chinese dialects use Hanzi, but Dungan uses cyrilic, while Hui Chinese also used to write in Arabic script.
Is there somewhere I can find a list of noun-verb pairs which differ in the voicing of the final consonant? So like use (n. \[jus\]) \~ use (v. \[juz\]), sheath \~ sheathe, bath \~ bathe, half \~ halve, etc. Also, is there a specific name for this phenomena?
"No cap, that’s sus" is slang, though. And linguists have been banging the drum about the existence and validity of AAVE for decades - in the last few years, it really has started to break through to public consciousness, as well.
I was a linguist for the Army (Cryptologic linguist MOS 35P). By linguist they mean someone bilingual able to do translations. You work in a control room and interpret foreign language intelligence in real time or at other times docs and reports.  This is what you’d be doing for DoD, CIA, NSA, etc.  It can be an interesting job, but a lot of it is very boring. My area was Korean so most of my experience was listening to North Korean field training exercises.
It likely has to do with Germanic invaders to romance counties. France was invaded by the Franks, Spain the Visigoths, Italy the Lombards. This brought the names of Germanic cultures into the languages.
Implication?
In Italian there aren't many 'remnants' of the Latin 'neuter' but for example, the 3rd person singular subject pronoun 'esso' is used to refer to an animal or thing. This article goes into a bit more detail: https://www.thoughtco.com/forgotten-italian-subject-pronouns-2011380
In Hebrew it's singular and I'm pretty sure in Spanish and French it's plural. This is a really interesting question! It highlights that we can't take anything for granted in language, everything is open to variation. This does raise the question, do some languages use the dual form? Edit: Just wanted to add that while in Hebrew you do use the singular for "the first and second floor" you can use the plural to make something like "first and second floors in each <x>", which is pretty cool.
they are not merged in the standard dialects or their closest relatives.
Almost none. There's a couple names/words that have been suggested as Munda but nothing definitive.   This is unsurprising though, since Munda probably arrived in [India around the same time or even after](https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/52454/1/02RauSidwell2019_2Munda.pdf) Indo-Aryan languages did, but on the opposite side of the subcontinent, so there weren't really any opportunities for Sanskrit to interact with Munda. And the other Austro-Asiatic languages of India are even further removed from the Sanskrit core.
I'd also have to wonder why the 3rd person is special in this regard. So I did a little searching, and I hope this makes sense. (If someone knows better, please correct me.) According to wiktionary, the accusative and dative of 1st and 2nd pronouns were [already indistinct](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/he#Declension_4) in Old English. However, I remembered seeing a [mec](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mec#Pronoun) and [þec](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BEec) previously, which were apparently the accusatives at some point, at least for the Anglian dialects. Per the first of those links, West Saxon had already leveled the accusative/dative distinction to the dative form, so maybe that was also something that spread to the 3rd person. As West Saxon went on to become the [basis of standard English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Saxon_dialect#Late_West_Saxon) after the Norman Conquest, maybe that spread the grammar to other parts of England. It's kinda funny though, because the cognate terms to the Anglian 1st and 2nd person accusatives apparently resulted in the modern pronouns and their spellings in [German](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/du#Declension_2) and [Icelandic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BE%C3%BA#Declension) for their accusatives, and at least the spelling in [Danish](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/du#See_also_4), which only has subject-object/oblique distinction like Modern English. *However*, [Dutch](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hem#Etymology_4) apparently ultimately draws its object pronouns from the [Proto-Germanic dative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/himmai), same as Modern English.

are you talking orthographically, phonetically, or phonemically?
Could you elaborate? I don't really understand the question. Are you talking about the interaction between language and ideology? Something like sociology of language could be the branch you're looking for.

Why should isolating languages not use compounds?

I do nod' like ab'osd'rob'hes and I am kenuinely unhab'b'y with Enklish's use of ab'osd'rob'hes. Unfortunately it's the standard so I have to use it. So why should I support the use of apostrophes in a language that will have to use them far more often?  That's not considering a k/g distinction is far more readable without a small apostrophe breaking up a word as in the first sentence above. I'd rather we get rid of characters altogether and use the Arabic script to write Chinese than use apostrophes.

There's some evidence and discussion around Creoles where saying they come from pidgins isn't quite right. They are probably direct descendants of the parent languages, which have evolved quicker than other varieties due to outside influence. This is different from the "traditional" view where pidgins are nativized by a children who grow up around them. Here's some further reading: https://t.co/eM9KIQD0gn

It's a good question.   A little research on book databases suggests that the *Geschichte der slawischen Sprache und Literatur nach allen Mundarten* ("History of the Slavic language and literature in all dialects") (1826) by the Slovak scholar [Pavel Jozef Šafárik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Jozef_%C5%A0af%C3%A1rik) may have played a role in popularizing the German equivalent "(Alt) Kirchenslawisch" ("[Old] Church Slavic"). For example, [at one point](https://archive.org/details/geschichtedersl01afgoog/page/n223/mode/2up?q=kirchenslawisch) Šafárik speaks of "Alt- od[er] Kirchenslawisch" ("Old or Church Slavic"). The very next year, we see a reference to "church Slavonic" in the [introduction to an English translation](https://archive.org/details/servianpopularp02bowrgoog/page/n25/mode/2up?q=%22church+slavonic%22) of "Servian [sic] Popular Poetry".
I'm not a neurobiologist (I'm a psycholinguist), so I'll focus on the linguistics arguments: >It would provide a much clearer model for how this works than tortuous rules-based explanations I think this is a bit of a strawman argument, I'm not aware of any linguist that would argue that meaning is rule based, at least not in this day and age (rule-based arguments tend to be focused towards more syntactic and morphological operations). Further, many linguists, myself included, would argue that the learning of words is experience-based. That is to say, a child learns a bunch of different objects that receive the label "table" and begin to associate all said objects with the word "table." This is a bit of an oversimplification as it becomes much more complex and difficult at abstract levels (words like 'thought' or 'society' etc; Tomasello has a few chapters related to this in his 2003 book 'Constructing a Language').  &#x200B; As for the specific hypothesis in regards to language, at least with your example, I think it's certainly plausible that "table" has a bunch of various meanings (this part is probably uncontroversial) which are narrowed down by the proceeding word "myst" or narrowed by the context, etc. What specifically those meanings are or how they're stored, I think, is where there is probably some controversy. &#x200B; As u/abottomful has mentioned, there's an entire field in linguistics devoted to these questions, Semantics, which has an abundance of information on this topic. I highly recommend looking at some sources (if you're not too familiar with semantics, maybe pick up an introduction to Semantics book. Additionally, the wikipedia page is not bad: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics)).  &#x200B; Wrote this in a bit of a hurry, so if anything is unclear let me know.

It's the same expression in Dutch! Imported probably from English.  Small difference; in Dutch we throw someone *in front* of the bus.

Because of the brevity of the top answer, I felt like exemplifying this. Here are the first two sentences of the Dutch Wikipedia page on traffic signs: *Verkeersborden zijn een van de drie soorten verkeerstekens die de wegbeheerder kan gebruiken om het verkeer op de weg te regelen. De andere twee zijn verkeerslichten en wegmarkering.* Translating it into German somewhat literally you can really see the similarities: *Verkehrsschilder sind eine von drei Arten Verkehrszeichen, die die Straßenverwaltung gebrauchen (einsetzen) kann, um den Verkehr auf der Straße zu regeln. Die anderen zwei sind Verkehrsampeln und Straßenmarkierungen.* In fact almost all of the words are cognates. Dutch uses weg though as the generic term for "road," while German prefers "Straße" (exisiting in Dutch as "straat"). In German "Weg" is used more to mean "path." "Wegbeheerder" is a very clearly Dutch form, as "beheeren" (manage) has no cognate in German and is instead "verwalten." Also Germans use "Ampel" (hanging lamp) for traffic lights, although the word "Lichter" also exists in German In English you can see just how different it is: *Traffic signs are one of the three kinds of traffic symbols that road administrators can use to manage traffic on roads. The other two are traffic lights and road markings.* I realize it's just one example, but Dutch and German are really very similar. Edit: corrected as per below comment (see that comment for the original)
/r/. I can pronounce all of the other trills.
*Mark and Luke come home* vs. *Mark and Luke, come home!* A vocative case would allow to emphasize this syntactic difference.
Why does Wiktionary give Middle, Old Chinese reconstructions for certain Mandarin onomatopoeia? For instance, it reconstructs [淅瀝](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/淅瀝#Chinese) <xi li> as /*sek lek/ in Middle Chinese, but I feel like it is precisely the openness of the coda and the [i] in Mandarin that is iconic. Am I just biased because I speak Mandarin? Do contemporary non-Mandarin varieties (esp. those with different vowels and checked codas) also have this word? Is this word attested in older Chinese texts, where all readers would have pronounced it as a checked tone?  Generally, are the majority of Mandarin onomatopoeia/ideophones actually inherited from Middle/Old Chinese, such that they would warrant reconstruction?
Because some phrases are contracted, like "he's", I wasn't sure if I can focus one bit, like "he IS". Is that on purpose?
No, but I'd presume this is something that Human Computer Interaction / User Interface research might be interested in. See papers like this one (CHI is one of the major HCI conferences): https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313859825_Modelling_Learning_of_New_Keyboard_Layouts

Молоко represents a concept that logically has no plural.
Are you located in/near one of the Great Lakes states? I'm from that area and what you explained sounded kinda familiar, so relying heavily on [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_English_regional_phonology), relevant points from the "Inland North" subsection of North and North-Central: >However, the Inland North dialect has been modified in the mid-1900s by the Northern Cities Vowel Shift (NCS). . . > >The NCS is a chain shift involving movements of six vowel phonemes: > >. . .then lastly the lowering and backing of /ɪ/ (but without any *pin-pen* merger). Having grown up there, I wouldn't say that it's universal or that it's your idiolect, as I've definitely known other people who lower /ɪ/.
The German lyrics translate roughly to "The winter is nice, and I love my cap, but (put) me in summer, and I'll turn into a puddle." (I'm having a bit of trouble with the singer's accent, and I can't quite get the verb used for "put.") That allows Mütze (hat) to rhyme with Pfütze (puddle) In the animation, Olaf is, in fact, not wearing a hat.
Before cancel culture there was PC culture, and a bulk of that involved the social removal of certain words that were deemed to be rude. Banning words is not a new idea, referenced in the book 1984, standard in radio/tv show management, etc. This is a blogpost about words and a new way of thinking about them, what they represent, euphemism treadmills, slurs, and political correctness. Trying to dive deeper into what a word really is, and what purpose banning them serves
To answer your second question, in my native language, Czech, I notice new words for this meaning are often introduced, too. Some of the many examples are (with their original meanings in quotation marks): hustý "dense", přehnaný "over the top", zabitý "killed", top (from English), raketa "a rocket", etc. A new word for this seems to pop up every few years.
Technology growth is exponential, at least partly because the more technology you have, the easier it is to grow more technology. Technological improvements happen every day they're just released annually.  EVs have been something we could make for a very long time. The technology to make a vehicle drive using electricity is not really new (the other software in a Tesla may be newer though). Companies have clearly struggled to find a way to make EVs profitable. A main issue with EVs is that the electrical grid does not currently have the infrastructure for everyone to drive an EV. Also consuming that much electricity for everyone to go to EVs doesn't really fix the fossil fuel issue if we're burning coal to charge our vehicles.
The code gets compiled into an assembly language which is the human readable version of the machine code. It is basically just a list of instructions, one on each line. They can have from zero to two arguments each depending on the instruction. These assembly line instructions is then converted to machine code simply by looking up the corresponding operator code for that instruction depending on the number and type of parameters. The CPU knows which opcodes have parameters, how long each parameter is and what each parameter means. So it will read the entire opcode with parameters as one instruction.
Instead of printing out all four letters for the name 'John' in the phone book just use one letter or symbol instead reducing the amount of space required.
At the ELI5 level: * CPUs are specialized in executing instructions.  There are a large number of different instructions that the CPU can execute, so the circuitry is somewhat complex, but in general there are 1-4 processing cores, surrounded by several layers of fast memory to hold small bits of data and instructions in queue for the cores to work on. * Graphics processors are specialized in doing simple math with integers.  This is because, if you look at a scene in a game, and then you try to animate it and walk through it, the math required to deform objects (so that they look animated from your perspective), calculate where the light is coming from and where the shadows should be, how clothing and hair should move in the wind, etc., all of these are simple math (addition subtraction multiplication etc.) but applied to very large [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_\(mathematics\)), because ultimately your screen is a matrix with 1080 rows and 1920 columns of pixels (color brightness numbers), and all of these pixels must be redrawn at least 60 times per second (FPS).  So the GPU is specialized to do very fast simple math on large spreadsheets of integers.  And that's why a GPU has some 2000+ (simple) math cores, surrounded by very fast memory to feed them with data in parallel. * Digital currency mining involves math with integers (just like graphics cards), but not necessarily large matrices of small numbers.  So a graphics card is better suited for this than a CPU, but it's possible to optimize the process even more by using procesing cards that have math cores specialized for calculating hash functions (plugging numbers into a specific formula as fast as possible).   So the ASIC computers basically do away with all the "not necessary" stuff, like actual graphics performance or a strong CPU, in favor of being able to cram as many of these ASIC cards in to do the mining as fast as possible, and for the minimum amout of power possible. If you're familiar with computers and are asking about the actual differences in chip architecture, not sure that can be explained at the ELI5 level, sorry.
actually they can’t if a player has a 60kbps connection, that’s like 90’s dialup speed (phone landline connection). you hardly can do anything on modern web these days at that speed. but two players on normal conditions can play online across the world if the game has infrastructure that allows it. Servers have huge speeds and maybe different ones are scattered around the globe connected between them. in that case you only need enough speed to reach your nearest server, and the servers do the heavy work of crossing the world and delivering data to other players
Even at an ELI level, this can be a bit of a labor to explain. But basically we can use transistors to replicate the behavior of logical operations which can then replicate the behavior of mathematical operations. We also use them to hold electrical charges (basically memory) and to control the flow of electricity. Building up from simply components we can make ever more complicated things. If you want to see a nice, hands-on way this can happen, I think [NAND game](https://nandgame.com/) is a great tool that demonstrates this.
Wait ‘till you hear about the [Terabyte MicroSD Card](https://www.westerndigital.com/products/memory-cards/sandisk-extreme-uhs-i-microsd#SDSQXA1-1T00-GN6MA) (~1000GB) For real though, the difference is the *density* of the memory circuits. The MicroSD card shape and size is an industry standard.   Their storage capacity is determined by how small the manufacturer makes the memory circuits.   Old cards had low memory because it was difficult or expensive to make smaller memory circuits.   Now, technology has improved and it’s easier and cheaper to make smaller circuits, so we get the same size card with more data storage crammed inside.

It really depends on the game. Let's look at chess for a basic example. When it's the AI's turn in chess, it can have ~100 different moves it can do. It can look at various moves and give the resulting board state a score. That score can be an algorithm that looks at things like how many pieces (with each piece having a value). It can factor in things like which pieces are threatened, which pieces are threatened but retaliation, etc.  There are two places you can easily tune your AI. The first thing you can do is have it look more than 1 move ahead. Rather than look at just your own move, look at what your opponent can do on the subsequent move, and then use that to calculate scores. Another thing you can do is adjust that scoring algorithm. Your basic scoring algorithm might just try and take as many pieces as possible, but a more advanced one might be looking at how much it's giving up to take those pieces. An even more advanced one is looking at how well you're protecting your pieces to make sure your opponent doesn't have a cheap take on their side. As for adjusting on the fly, you basically have to have another algorithm that's looking at the bot's odds of winning, and if it's not doing well enough, to ramp up the difficulty. If it's doing too well, it can lower the difficulty.  With a game like Rocket League, you don't necessarily have as clean as a board state as Chess, but you can look at metrics like "how soon can I get to the ball", "how soon can my teammates get to the ball", "how soon can my opponents get to the ball", "is the ball on their side or ours?", and use that for determining what actions they'll perform. In addition, they can also change the polling frequency of the AI. In a game like chess, it has to make a decision every turn. With a game like Rocket League, you can have it reevaluate its plan every 5s, 2s, 1s, 0.5s. This can also naturally introduce imperfect shots, since it's trying to make a shot based on slightly old data.
Generally, for a laptop it's a fairly simple process in two parts: There's a transformer, which changes to voltage from the mains level (110 or 220 volts) to something lower (whatever the laptop needs - it'll be on the sticker on the bottom). It does this by having two coils of wires with a different ratio of the number of turns in the coils. As the electrical current moves through one coil, it generates a electro-magnetic field, which passes through to the other coil and generates electrical current there. The ratio of turns determines how much the voltage steps down or up. The second part is called a bridge rectifier, which converts alternating current to direct current.  This is typically done with a set of four diodes, which are the electrical equivalent of a one way valve.  Properly arranged, the will make sure that regardless of which way the alternating current is moving and a particular time (it usually changes 50 times per second), it will be shunted in the same path, making it direct current. There's other parts such as sensors, capacitors for smoothing out any ripples or imperfections in the power quality, etc. But that's the basic parts in any laptop charger, plug pack or anything else of that nature.
They were written in machine language.  Humans converted the "program" into wiring instructions for the processor.  In the earliest days this was actually plugging wires in which changed the computer's wiring.
You are getting answers in the theoretical realm.  In the practical realm it is a matter of semantics.  And it depends on the place you work on what you are called.   Someone called a programmer may actually be doing software engineer.  And some software engineers are programming.
The first bits of everything were generated in assembly language dependent on the architecture of the processor being developed on. We've since started programming in higher level languages, think of this like a layer cake where the instructions the processor itself understands are the base (assembly language) and everything else rests above that. This is very oversimplified of course.
It's not harder, there's just not a ton of demand for that for home users so it isn't offered much. A home user is much more likely to watch 4 hours of HD video on Netflix in a day than they are uploading 4 hours of HD video to YouTube. So imagine a highway wide enough for 8 lanes. This is the internet connection available to you the home consumer. It could be set up to have 4 lanes going one way and 4 the other, a symmetrical link, but those 4 lanes each way don't allow them to min/max the numbers to do "bigger is better" plays with advertising. If it's adjusted to be 6 and 2, now they can use the 6 to go "look guys we offer 6 lanes of incoming traffic!" and people buy it because that's a higher number so now they can support 3 devices streaming or whatever.
Because as they say, numbers don't lie. Data gives historical evidence and trends that shape and give indication of the future so it is possible to make forecasts.
Laptop power bricks are switch mode power supplies that convert wall power so like 120 or 220 vac to a galvanically isolate 12-20 volts dc. The power brick consist of many electrically components such as resistors, capacitors, silicone chips and ics that will kill power if things get too hot and other stuff like that. The two items inside that are responsible for the weight is the transformer and heat sinks. The transformer is what actually steps up or down voltage and consist of copper wire wound around an iron core, so these things can be on the heavy side.  Then the heat sinks are basically just hunks of aluminum used to cool down the mosfets. There is a good reason for them to be so big but if you’ve actually taken one apart you’ll notice that they typically do a good job making it as compact as possible.
JPEG is old (1992), JPEG-XL is modern and has  30 years of progress to use and can assume computers are 30 years faster, so it's better. But WebP, JPEG2000,, JPEG-XR, AVIF and a bunch of others also tried this and only got used in a few places, despite being better than JPEG (at least by some measures). JPEG-XL looks like it might actually fully replace JPEG (and PNG) on the web because it does everything really well, it's standardized, it's  free, it's widely supported and it has clever web specific tools that many other attempts ignored. Especially, you can take old existing JPEGs, make them smaller for users with new browsers and still serve the old ones. Avoids a lot of chicken and egg complications that new formats face. There's been a million clever engineers trying to make websites faster, but they've barely kept up with the other clever engineers trying to make things do more. This is a relatively big improvement, but as an end user you'll probably never notice, it'll just be one small part of the web being better than it used to be.
QR codes are a really cool way of encoding information in an image. You'll notice of to look at one, there are a few obvious landmarks that all QR codes share, the large nested squares in 3 corners, and the smaller nested squares in the final corner. These landmarks allow the decoder to determine the scale and orientation of the QR code. Once that's determined, the remainder of the QR code is a lot like binary, it's a grid of squares which are either filled or unfilled, like binary 1s and 0s (this is a simplification of the actual encoding mechanism which is quite complex and allows for a bunch of redundancy, which is why you often have a company logo over the QR Code, obscuring some of the grid, but it still works) The decoder then reads the "binary" message from the grid, and it comes out as a URL to a website or an app, or some instructions that the reader so can act upon.
Standard USB-A (the regular computer USB ports) only supports 5V, which is fine for charging a phone at maybe at most 10W, not much more than that, because it would require too much current through the thin wires USB C on the other hand supports usb power delivery, when means devices can ask how much voltage they want and the charger (if supported) will give it to them, so it can deliver more power I should also add that there are some quick chargers on USB A, but it’s not a USB protocol standard, it uses other protocols like quickcharge to deliver the right voltage to devices tagt support it
J&J uses the same process as the flu vaccines. A tame virus is programmed to make the antigen (a piece of spike protein).  To multiply the tame viruses, they use eggs, because viruses need living cells to multiply.  The mRNA vaccines are multiplied in a biochemical reaction (in vitro). They just have the instructions for the antigen.  Simply put, J&J delivers a factory that produces spike protein, but mRNA vaccines deliver an instruction manual.
Imagine you have a word document. It reads fine except wherever you would expect to see the word "the" there is the letter "Z". Now, you notice at the beginning of the word document you see a line that says: "Z = the." So you go up and you replace all of the instances of the letter "Z" with the word "the." Now the document reads properly, but is not probably significantly larger than it was. This is the principle compression and decompression works on.
CPU doesn't refer to using the actual CPU, as in the computer component.  It just means play against a computer controlled player.
You can imagine a computer as being an office space that is designed very meticulously, and filled with *very specific* features (like desks, water coolers, staplers) that do *very specific* things located in *very specific* places. Software designed for a certain kind of computer are like employees that come into the office to do their jobs *extremely* exactly, and are trained to expect those very specific features  to be located in their very specific places. If *anything* is even slightly out of place, they get lost and start screwing up. So the basic thought is, "A console is just a small office, but my computer is a much bigger, more productive office. Surely the employees can just move into my office and work just as fast?" Except, no. Your office may be big, and full of all the latest, fanciest office tech, but nothing is in the right place. Those narrow-focused employees can't do any of their work because nothing is where it should be. You have two options here. The first option would be to fire all the old employees and get new ones that can do their jobs in your new office. In this metaphor, that would be the equivalent of porting the software to the new system. That's a process that is very time consuming and expensive, and when done, you're only left with one piece of ported software. You could instead try the second option, where you *fake* the old office inside of your fancy one. Then *all* the old employees will know where everything is without needing to be retrained. This is an emulator. The thing about emulation is, for the most part, it's really inefficient. When you build the "fake" office for all of the employees inside of your regular one, you're not just rearranging all of the things inside your office to make it look like the old one. No, your office is fixed and can't change where anything is, or else you'll mess up your own employees. To pull this off, you have to get some plywood and build an entire makeshift box in a free open space inside your normal office, and furnish the inside of that box just like the old office. And anything that fake office needs from the outside has to be manually supplied by your office's employees on the fly. Does the fake office have a sink with running water? Your main office employees have to go to their own sink, fill up buckets of water manually, and dump it into the fake office at just the right speed and time to make the fake office look like it has running water. Does the fake office have a clock on the wall that gets looked at? Your main office employees have to look over at their own clocks, potentially translate the time to a different time zone, scrawl a picture of it down on a card, and flash it in the place the fake office would normally have a clock every single time anyone in the fake office tries to look at it. Faking a computer inside another computer is simply a very inefficient process due to all these little slowdowns adding up. Even really big, powerful computers can struggle to provide everything that fake office needs to run at full speed, even if the fake office itself is rather small.
How is reddit suppose to know why ur grandma bought a gaming pc?
Docker provides a standard way to create, distribute, and run software. It's a reliable way of providing compatibility because the standards are so strict; "it just works" because you're simply not allowed to do the things that native software can do. A Docker image is like a hard drive with an OS and applications installed on it. When you create a Docker image, it starts with an OS install (although this is typically done for you, so you don't have to do it yourself). Then whatever applications are installed -- but again, this is often done for you: if you just tell Docker you want a popular software package like Java, someone has already done the install so you can just use their install without doing it yourself. So what's inside your Docker image is not substantially different than what would be on your hard drive if you installed all that stuff manually. When it comes time to run your Docker image, we call those containers. And we call them that because what's going on inside of them is locked inside; Docker containers cannot access the host OS or software. It can't even access your network or hard drive, unless you give it permissions to. Even then, the container only has the access you give it, so you can share one folder and it can't see any of your other files.  Containerization is good for security (a virus in the container can't escape the container and get into your machine), but also for stability. In a traditional software environment, software shares libraries and DLLs, so if something happens with a DLL or library (such as a patch or upgrade) can break a bunch of applications that were using them. With Docker, each container is completely independent with their own DLLs and libraries, so one container doing something crazy can't affect the others. One of the neat things, though, is layering the images. So if you have two containers that both use Java on Linux, you'll just have one copy of Linux and one copy of Java that's shared between containers -- however, those layers are read-only. Any changes made in one container will not be seen by the other container, because each container has it's own separate layer stacked on top of the read-only Linux and Java layers.
The processor (brain) can only do so many things at time, as it has limited resources. When you use up its available resources, it can't do more right now. It prioritises tasks to use resource when it becomes available. Giving it more tasks takes more time as they queue up.  If I asked you to make dinner, clean your room, get dressed and brush your teeth - you'd have to also prioritise tasks using your available resources as you can't do it all at once. So it takes more time.
Because memory modules are faster the latency of the communication lines between the processor and memory is actually important. So even long after hard drive have moved to serial interfaces the memory modules are still using a low latency parallel interface. This is why there is so many pins. Each command is sent all at once with one bit per pin. However this means that there is a limited address space. If the processor wants to retrieve the data beyond 512GB it needs to use a bit which is not there. There just is not enough pins on the memory module. The pin is actually there from the processor but instead of being sent to the memory module it is sent to the motherboard which will make sure only one of the memory modules on the channel is enabled. So using multiple modules it is possible to have more then 512GB of memory.
in minecraft or in real life..? Irl, steam engines are all fundamentally simple: water is boiled by some heat source to make steam, and that steam (being hot gas) wants to expand and either turns a turbine or pushes a piston to do mechanical work.
NumLock and ScrollLock both exist for those people who are spreadsheet ~~Archmages~~ experts The number pad is by far the fastest way to punch numbers into a spreadsheet repeatedly, that's why it exists.  Having access to arrow keys on the same hand speeds up navigation of nearby cells while access to Home (go to the left-most cell), End (goes to the right-most cell), Page up, and Page down speed up access to distant points on the sheet. Scroll lock is another key that exists almost solely for navigation of spreadsheets.  If you are in Excel and you turn on ScrollLock you can use the arrow keys to move the screen without losing the cell that you're in so you can pan up and right to see columns/rows you may be missing but still be able to type in your selected cell.  Again, just a key that exists almost solely for improved navigation in spreadsheet programs So your next thought is, why do we need keys for this?  You can clearly just use the mouse to move around or click on the cell you want Except for many years you didn't have a mouse.  Back in the before times, a lot of "computers" were terminals that accessed a mainframe and timeshared, LANPAR was a spreadsheet program for Mainframes back in 1969.  Microsoft DOS didn't support a mouse until 1982, and mice were uncommon until around 1985.  That's about 25 years of spreadsheet programs being in common use without mice being in common use.
Minecraft has an item inside it called Redstone which can transmit signals over a distance. There are number of other Redstone components (redstone torches, repeaters, diodes, etc.) which can control this redstone signal in a way that mimics traditional logical circuits (AND, OR, NOR, etc.) Since this is all PCs are based on anyway, you can therefore create Redstone circuits that mimic the behavior of actual CPUs.
On older spinning platter magnetic media drives, where each "bit" of information is just a small area of the magnetic platter that gets magnetized or demagnetized by the read/write heads. But if you think of how the region gets magnetized, it isn't a consistent amount - the head's EM field only has a very short time to induce the corresponding field in the platter surface. Think if you will like coats of paint.  If you paint a freshly drywalled wall, that first coat of paint is maybe 80% but you can still see some thin areas where the drywall colour is coming through. Give it a second coat, you're up to 98% and after a third coat its 99.999% coverage. Same thing with the magnetic surface. Write a "1" once and its maybe at 80%, 2nd 98% and so on. Conversely, writing a "0" might only get it to 5 or 10% charge. A "1" AFTER a "0" might be 75%. With careful calibration and the right recovery tools (hardware AND software), you can figure out what two 1's after 0's looks like for example and work backwards and if you're lucky you can rebuild what a file might have looked like.  But this level of forensic recovery is really expensive and only worthwhile if its like FBI state secret evidence stuff, or the crypto keys to your fortune are on that drive. Writing successive zeros gets those bit regions closer and closer to 0% charge. But, if you had to do it, do random 1's and 0's not all just 0's. Buries the data under random noise, makes file recovery much much harder. But if you only do a single pass of just 0's, there are some prosumer tools that might have some success.
Time spent having fun isn’t time wasted. Aside from that, it depends on the game. Some test and improve your memory and problem solving skills, some test and improve your reflexes. Some are just fun.
Let’s pretend you have 100 legos, mixed in 4 different boxes. Someone asks you for all of the red legos. You find those legos, in all of the boxes, and provide to the person who asked for them. Additionally, you may be asked to analyze each lego and find the best use for it. Are all 100 there? Is one box overflowing? What colors are there? Are any damaged? Can any legos connect perfectly with other legos? Does each Lego have the same number of bumps? Etc. Now just change legos for data. And boxes for databases.
As a general rule there isn't much reason to keep ram empty. There isn't really any cost associated with 'deleting' what it in there if something else needs the space. As a result of this Windows (and many other modern operating systems) make some effort to try and 'guess' what stuff you might want in RAM and to get it there before you ask for it.   Probably the most notable example of this in Windows is something called "Superfetch" which is Windows loading your frequently used programs into RAM. The RAM used for this is in a kind of weird state, as it's full of useful data, but it's also 'available' if a program needs it.
Often times it comes with early access, which in my opinion, is the biggest attraction for pre orders.
It take time to draw animation. You need to pay people for their time. More time equals more money.  And it take more time to make higher quality animation.
For context USB was a bit of a miracle when it first came out in the 90s. Prior to USB peripherals used Serial or Parallel cables or proprietary stuff. Drivers weren't installed automatically and **everything** had to be done manually. USB had it's problems at first, but it was still miles ahead of what we were doing before. Making a USB-A look like a headphone jack would have been terrible because users wouldn't stop plugging those into the speaker and line in jacks on their PCs -.- USB A was fine aside from the problem of seemingly never being able to get it right side up the first time. Micro and Mini USB were invented because we needed smaller connectors for devices, and they were just fine. Apple were the intelligent ones that invented Lightning, a connector that work either side up. USB-C is the universal standard based around that concept.
Are you confusing factory resetting with formatting?  Deletong a large file just requires deleting all the records for that one file form the file table, the steps are: look where the references to the file are, delete them, and fix up the rest of the table so there are no gaps. There can be many records for a large file , but it typically downs take more than a handful of seconds   factory resetting usually involves deleting all the files while keeping the OS, and then resetting all settings, which typically takes more time than just deleting one file However formatting is different from factory resetting, that just wipes the file table clean and doesn’t care what files are where, which takes almost no time at all
A game engine is essentially a starting kit for developing games. Most game engines contain things that nearly every game needs, such as lighting, physics, some sort of asset manager, etc. This allows for developers to spend more time actually making games rather than fixing bugs with the game-making tools.  Some game engines are available for everyone to use (Unreal Engine, Unity) while others are in-house for big name developers (RAGE for Rockstar for example).
The simple way to make it bigger is just to have every pixel from the original image take up 3 pixels in the new image. But if you just blow up a bunch of pixels in a diagonal line, it's going to look like a staircase. The more complicated way it to identify which things are "lines" and don't make it wider as you scale everything else up so it stays as a crisp narrow line. The emulator's upscaling does a bunch of tricks like that instead of just increasing the size of the image.
Assembly is the instruction set CPUs understand. They "know" that a certain arrangement of bits corresponds to an action, it's hardwired in.  Say 00000010 means ADD (not the actual arrangement for addition), and then it expects two sets of bits to add together, say 00001000 and 00000100.  The actual bit stream would be 000000100000100000000100, which might not seem intuitive, but the CPU can read that as "ADD 8, 4". Obviously that's a simple example, but that's really the basics of it all.
I’ll try to explain as best I can and not infodump lol. All ARGs are very different from each other, but the things they have in common are that they take place in the real world, have characters, and tell a story.    Characters are people included by the creator that help move the game/story along. Some ARGs also involve players, which are people not involved with the creator that discover the clues.      ARGs are made either to promote something or just for fun to tell a story. The Dark Knight actually had an ARG to promote the movie. Basically, in an ARG, the creator is in charge of the characters, clues, and story, while players discover these clues and help uncover the story. It’s difficult to put an exact explanation of how they work since there are so many of them that all work in different ways. The Catastrophe Crow ARG, for instance, doesn’t work the same as the Daisy Brown one, but I digress. In general, that’s how ARGs operate. Hopefully this answers ur question and makes some sense lol.
IT is a very broad category that can refer to pretty much anyone that works on computers. This includes desktop support professionals, software developers, cyber security, database engineers, and also computer networking engineers.
On a HDD there are billions of magnetic 'switches' that are flipped on or off for 1s and 0s
> cheap cooling   A fridge that cools a computer is much more energy-consuming than a couple of fans or some water pump. So I doubt that it's cheaper.
The registry is a part of Windows where it stores a lot of settings and parameters, both for the system and for the programs you installed. If you delete a program, the data corresponding to it isn't needed anymore but in some cases it's not deleted. Some bugs also may corrupt some pieces of data in the registry. As the old data and glitches pile up, this may cause slowdown or visible bugs. But usually you would be fine.
A mechanical watch is powered by a spring. The more the spring winds down, the weaker the force gets that drives the watch. So with just a simple mechanism, the watch would get slower and slower as the spring winds down. We obviously don't want that, so we need a mechanism that moves at a constant rate, no matter how hard you push it. In a wall-mounted mechanical clock, this is done with a pendulum, but the watch needs to work in any position. This is a pretty hard engineering challenge, and the solution requires an intricate mechanism with a lot of parts.
It depends on areal density and controlling the magnetic effect.  Here is an old video, but it tells the story. https://youtu.be/xb_PyKuI7II Larger discs (10 TB) use more platters, but there is a physical and electromagnetic limit to how many bits can be stored on each platter.
TLDR: There's no advantage to defraging an SSD because it doesn't suffer from the problems that spinner drives do, so the defraging process just wears out SSDs for no good reason. Data is written to a traditional spinning hard drive in circles from the inside track out, kinda like an old vinyl record but in reverse. As files get modified they grow in size but often there is no more space available on the drive in the area the file was originally written because it's filled up with other files. So the modified file gets broken up into pieces and stored all over the drive. This is called fragmentation. The reason it's bad is because a hard drive has a physical reader head that has to move back and forth. The more it has to move the slower the drive operates to access the data, so if a file is fragmented you're causing the drive to move the head around a whole bunch for no reason. Defragmenting moves all the files parts back together to speed up access. SSDs on the other hand don't have any moving parts so any byte of data can be accessed at the same speed regardless of where it is physically stored. So defragmenting an SSD is pointless. Worse SSDs can only write to its cells so many times, so defragmenting just causes the drive to wear out faster while providing no real advantage.
x86 is named that because of Intel's original line of chips: 8086, 80186, 80286, 80386, 80486... by 80586 Intel ran into difficulties trademarking a number, hence "Pentium" ("Pente" = 5, eg "pentagon" is a 5-sided polygon). They all have the "86" in the name, hence x86. x64 is a shortening of x86-64, meaning the x86 design with 64 bits support added on top. A bit of trivia: Though the x86 is Intel's creation, x86-64 was made by AMD, and later adopted by Intel. Intel tried to go in a completely different direction. Their 64 bit CPU was called Itanium, wasn't compatible with x86 code, and it only saw business use and wasn't really successful there either. So eventually Intel gave up on it and adopted AMD's design.
Data rates are usually advertised in megabits per second but the speed test you ran probably showed your speed in megabytes per second. The difference is if it is a little case b or a big case B (Mb or mb versus MB). There are 8 megabits in one megabyte. That means that 800 megabits per second should give you 100 megabytes per second. Buuuut... you also have to factor in the fact that data has to get routed around, just like driving from home to the grocery store. Your car can drive 160 mph but with speed limits you can probably only go 40 on your way there. And if you are using a wifi connection via router then that will also cut down on the speed a little bit.
>How this chunk of 0s and 1s of a given file is stored and tracked. ...  How the computer knows where in memory the file starts and where it ends? There's something called a *Master File Table* (this is its name in the NTFS file system, but an equivalent structure exists no matter what system you're talking about) that stores information about every file and folder on the drive. It records information like what address the file starts at, as well as if the file is broken up across multiple addresses and where they are. >How is it possible to rewrite and increase the size of a file without overriding the memory space of the adjacent file? If the increase in data fits into an existing *allocation unit,* it will just use that. If not, it will use the next free unit and write information in the MFT about where that allocation unit is.
RAM is like info in your brain that’s instantly accessible.  Disk usage is like having to look something up on your phone or in a book.  Imagine you’re baking a cake and you need to look up the recipe.  As you read each step it’s loaded into your brain (RAM).  As you complete each step you go back and read the next (disk usage) and the next step is loaded to RAM.
In most modern game engines (like Unreal or Unity, for example), the animation system is separated a bit from the underlying mechanics, to allow for easier division of labor between programmers/designers and artists/animators. There's not necessarily one right way to do it, but a common way is to have an "animation manager" attached to the model that reacts to specific actions by the player or conditions in the game and plays the corresponding animation (which the designers can set in the game engine), and the engine handles the complicated business of rendering and animating the model itself. As an added bonus, many engines can also "blend" between certain animations, like walking, jogging, and running, so that a character can appear to move at a more organic speed and with a more organic gait without having to have your art team make a run animation for every possible speed the character can go.
In a 4 GHz processor you're basically sending 4 billion pulses of electricity though the CPU every second.  Each of those pulses can only represent one (1) instruction and you have to wait until an instruction is fully executed and leaves the CPU before sending the next.   The reason that you have to wait before sending the next instruction is that you don't know how long its going to take for each instruction to go through or what path it will take.  If you send instruction #2 in before instruction #1 has come out then you don't know what will come out of the processor.  It could be the result of instruction #1 followed by the result of instruction #2.  Or it could be that instruction #2 crosses over into instruction #1 and you get an output that is the combination of both.  Or you could get instruction #2 coming out first, followed by instruction #1.  There's no way to know what you got without already knowing what the result of both instructions were beforehand. When you're sending 4 billion instructions per second the speed of light starts to become extremely relevant, even over distances that small.  The smaller the CPU, the shorter it takes each instruction to pass fully through the chip and come out the exit.  The quicker instructions are exiting the chip, the faster you can send them in. So doubling the size of a chip doesn't double the speed - it halves it because now you have to wait twice as long for each instruction to pass through.  Conversely, halving the size of a chip doubles the speed because now you have to wait half as long before sending in the next instruction.  That's why chip manufacturers make such a big deal about the nanometer size of the transistors.  If you took two chips with identical architecture, but one chip used 7nm transistors while the other used 14nm transistors, the 7nm chip would be twice as fast. Both Intel and AMD have developed some variant of multithreading technology that does try to predict the outcome of any given instruction.  This, in theory, allows the chip to sometimes send in a second instruction without waiting for the first to exit.  In practice, it doesn't get to send in that second instruction very often and even under ideal conditions you're still limited to sending in two instructions at once. If you could send in an infinite number of instructions at once then sure, bigger might be better.  But "very occasionally two" is really the practical limit and its going to be a awhile before we can push beyond that (if we ever can).
Chess is one of those games that has near-infinite possibilities.  At the game's beginning, there are 20 possible moves per player (based on the way that the pieces are set up), meaning that after 1 turn, there are 400 possible positions.  After two moves each, we've jumped up to nearly 200,000 possible positions, and after just three moves each, over 120 million.  What's happening on the board is slow, but inside the mind of a good player, dozens and dozens of possible combinations and continuations are taking place, and it's the mark of a truly great player to choose the one option out of hundreds that gives them the best chance to win. Don't get me wrong, for probably 99% of us, it's not something that's engrossing enough to devote hours and hours to - I really enjoy chess, but I still don't have the patience or depth of understanding to sit for more than a few minutes without settling on a move.  But for the people who are really fascinated by the endless possibilities, the time in between each move is incredibly interesting, because it's being spent exploring "Well, if I go here, then this, this, this, this, and I'll lose..... but if I go here..."
If you think about it, it's quite simple. Before hard drives, we had cassettes/CD etc. Any TV program that was aired would be stored simultaneously in VCR or tape format. To show a replay, one had to simply sind the exact spot in the recorded tape and broadcast that.  However, if you want to know before digital videography, we had film rolls.  Video would be shot in rolls of films. And the films would be played back. There were technicians who specialised in cutting, mixing and pasting different sets of films together. This was the equivalent of today's video editing. The name "cut" to signify changing scenes comes from the physical cut in the film rolls.  Essentially, replays only work with recorded footage. The forms of storing the footage has changed with time, from films to tapes to CDs to hard disk and now NVMs.  Hope I understood your question and answered satisfactorily.
It's expectation. We're all essentially becoming spoiled by how good technology has become. The same goes for everything. If something improves or you're used to something being a certain standard, we just get used to it and we start to expect that standard all the time. So when it fails, we get extra pissed off. Take a rich person who loses almost all of their money and has to live on $1k per month. They'll see that situation as horrible and depressing because they're used to so much more. Take someone living in one of the poorest parts of the world getting by on a dollar a day and offer them an income of $1k a month and they'll think it's the best thing that's ever happened to them.
Code: Drive the car to the supermarket and buy some eggs Compiled program: Set throttle position to 24%, continue for 22 seconds, set steering position to 45 degrees for three seconds, set brake to 50%, use feet, walk forward 78 paces, go to Isle 32, go to shelf 2, go to position 8, pick up item...... It takes a lot of work for a human to decipher the latter. For starters the information isn't even there about what's in Isle 32, that was somewhere else in the program and the references won't be human words anymore. So now you've got to decipher the code that defines what's in Isle 32, plus the code that defines how driving works, and walking e.t.c. before bits of code develop meaning. In a complex program its an absolutely mammoth and approaching impossible undertaking. Also what's the point of decompiling the code? What do you actually get from a million lines of code? It's not like there's some trade secret which is even worth stealing, the code runs this game and most of it probably has no use in any other game. The only purpose is to pirate or make cheats, and that's something which people already do. Also most of the game and work is the assets like meshes, textures, sounds, videos e.t.c and the actual code bit is very small. Edit: let's say code which takes 1 minute to write takes 1 hour to decompile. If a game takes  10 man years (10 people working a year, or 1 person working 10 years) to write, what value am I getting from my 600 man years to decompile the whole game back to source code. In that time I could have just written the code for 60 other games.
Here's a simple example: let's say I'm trying to send you a message that consists of up to 81 digits from 0 - 9. What I'll do is put them into a 10 x 10 grid so that the last row and column are empty. Then I'll fill in that last row and column with a number such that the sum of every row is zero (mod 10) and the sum of every column is zero (mod 10). Mod 10 just means that you wrap around. So 2+2=4, and 4+4=8, but 8+8=6 (it's 16 but you wrap around after 9). Let's say one number gets "corrupted" in transmission. As long as there's only a single error you can actually figure out exactly what cell contains the error, and figure out what the correct number should be, just with some simple math! To start, you add up all of the digits in each row and each column. Circle any row or column that doesn't add to zero mod 10. If there was one error, you'll have one row and one column circled. The cell where they intersect must be wrong. Figure out what number makes that row and column add up and you've fixed it. Now, the more errors the less likely this is to work, but it can be resilient to 1 or 2 errors pretty easily. Reed-Solomon is basically just a clever way to apply the same idea using fancier math. It maximizes the number of errors / corruptions that can happen and still guarantee you'll be able to recover 100% of the message.
The only time the troubleshooter ever works ( Ive seen it happen i swear ) is when the problem can be fixed by turning it off and on again.  Usually network issues that would have been solved by a reboot can also be solved by running the commands Ipconfig /release and  Ipconfig /renew I have also seen it work to fix sound driver issues ( when you have a red X on your sound icon )
Well the biggest factor is that old systems are tried and tested while new systems can have errors that can be fatal. You need experience with a system to be certain it will work when you want it to. I work in industrial control systems. Reliability is MUCH more important that performance. So there is a lot of reluctance to change a running system (even if it offers many new benefits) if you don't have 10 years of records where it runs without problems  In my field breaking something usually means a day of standstill that costs about 6 figures. A crashing military vehicle is vastly more expensive than that, and it might kill people.
Simplified of course: Cryptocurrency takes a LOT of processing power to work.  Rather than trying to finance mega data centers, the currencies farm it out to whoever happens to dedicate some of their processor time to it, effectively crowdsourcing the processing power.  This part depends on the currency but basically by being the one to process transactions or a certain threshold of transactions, you get a unit of the currency in return for that time on your hardware and network connection. "mining" rigs are just hardware individuals buy and dedicate entirely to processing crypto transactions and thus "mining" as much of that currency as possible.
In terms of networking, it's the amount of bits that can be send over a given period of time. So if some ISP says they offer 300 Mbps as their bandwidth, they are claiming you will get 300 Megabits (300,000,000 bits) every second when accessing the Internet through them.
Let's take the simplest example, where two computers are next to each other and they're connected directly via a CAT-6 Ethernet cable. A CAT-6 cable is just a bunch of copper wires. There's a bunch of physics involved in the exact choice of the cable design and shielding and twisting, but as a first step, just think about the fact that there are a handful of copper wires directly connecting the two computers. To send data, the computers just apply voltage to the wires to represent each bit. A 1 bit is a positive voltage (+2.5v), a 0 bit is a negative voltage (-2.5v). One computer sets the voltage, the other computer reads it. They agree ahead of time on a "clock rate" and send a new bit every time the clock "ticks". Ethernet is a very simple protocol. There's no waiting for your turn. When one computer wants to send data, it starts broadcasting it to any other computer it's connected to. If it detects a "collision" - i.e. two computers sending at the same time, then it stops transmitting, and waits a random amount of time before trying again. It sounds simple but it works extremely well in practice. When only one computer wants to "talk", it can send data as fast as it can. When a lot of computers all want to talk at once, they back off and give each other room. Ethernet only lets a computer send 1518 bytes at a time. That's one Ethernet packet. If it has more data to send, it breaks it down into more than one packet. There's nothing magic about a packet. It's just a bunch of bits. Exactly how to interpret those bits in order to communicate information is entirely up to how the computers decide to communicate. These days, the vast majority of the time those packets will all be IP (Internet Protocol) packets, and most of the packets will be using either TCP or UDP, which are standard protocols for communicating large amounts of data with any other device on the Internet. But, you don't HAVE to use IP. On your own local network you could have computers send whatever bytes they want, as long as some other computer on that network knows how to interpret those bytes. Finally, there are a bunch of other ways that computers communicate other than just Ethernet - there's Wifi, cable, fiber, USB, Bluetooth and a dozen other technologies. But they're all just different ways to physically send the bits from point A to point B. Interpreting the bits is a separate problem.
Your router does not know. The router just processes the demands made on it. If there is just one thing happening all resources (bandwidth and processing) are dedicated to the one thing happening. If multiple requests are made, the resources are shared. Sharing means each process is slower than if it was running alone. The more processes running, the longer each takes to complete.
The controller causes a physical change in the memory module. In floppy disks it was a magnetic change. SD cards use flash memory which has a set of gates that trap electrons. When electrons are trapped in the gate it changes the resistance of the gate. A new higher voltage is required to discharge the electrons from the gate. By using a voltage greater than the initial charge voltage, but less than the new higher voltage the device can check if a gate was previously charged or not.
There's no *one way* to do this, which is true for anything related to programming. You're writing code. You can do anything you want - especially if you're using C++ and have created your own game engine. There's no standard way of doing it either, every solution has pros and cons - every pro usually being weighed by a "it takes time"-con.
>How do the CPUs, which literally made of rocks, can process complicated stuff?      CPUs are incredibly complex and delicate electronic equipment. They are not literally made of rocks. At no point had there been any blunt knapping or cracking of pebbles. Every part and every layer of them is very deliberately assembled according to exact specifications on a scale of tens of nanometers - billions of electronic little switches all working together.
ARM processors are significantly less complicated than the x86 processors found in PCs but as a result they have a more limited instruction set meaning that they are less efficient at doing certain types of tasks. This lack of complexity means they are slower under certain circumstances and you have to write computer programs specifically for them. But the upside of less complexity is that they are cheaper, smaller, produce less heat, and use less power. Which makes them ideal for mobile devices like phones.
Imagine you are reading out a really long number to a friend. If you were doing the "raw binary" version it would be literally zero, five, four, two, two, two, two, three, seven, seven, seven, six, five. Etc. But irl that would be inefficient, you'd say zero, five, four, then four twos, three, triple seven, six, five. A bit like that.
If we go back 30 years ago, simple devices like your watering controller would not be computing devices. Those electronics would be made up of logic (AND, OR, XOR and Flip Flops) or analog devices. These can be used for very specific IF this THEN that type operations (IF a rain sensor detects rain THEN turn off the sprinklers). There might be also basic math done by analog or logic. Basic settings (time) might be stored. But it would be limited to the very specific tasks that a sprinkler controller needs to do. A computer is much more flexible. If can perform basically any type of data manipulation. Much more complex tasks can be done. More things can be "remembered".   It's program and behavior can be changed after the computer has been manufactured with a software update. That can't be done with a non-computing electronic device. Fast forward to today, "computer chips" have become so small and so cheap, that they are in virtually every electronic device. Rather than designing a complex circuit consisting of dozens of logic devices, it's cheaper to just use tiny computer chip (or die embedded in a larger chip) and write software to do the logic operations required. That wasn't always the case, but it is now.
You arrange transistors into logic gates. You arrange logic gates into adders, multipliers, etc. You create a list of binary numbers and assign them operations (e.g. 000:Add, 001:Subtract, 010:Multiply, 100:Move, etc). You take more transistors and arrange them into things that store a 1 or a 0 as long as power is provided. You make lots of them. No, I mean way more. You create a little device that can take three numbers: A, B and Operation. The device checks the number at Operation and routes A and/or B to the correct sub-device based on that list we made. You now have a very basic CPU core. Make a bunch of simple cores that are specifically designed to do multiplication really fast. You now have a GPU. Create a large data pipe between your CPU and GPU. Calculate a lot of points in 3D space. Convert all the points to a 2D image using linear algebra.  Display it on a screen.
A mechanical hard drive is spinning platters of a material that can be magnetized and demagnetized and therefore can hold information as 1's and 0's based on a specific spot being magnetized or not.  A solid state drive are memory chips composed of a type of transistor that will change states of holding a 1 or a 0. The state is kept until it is changed again. Thus when you make a change to the hard drive you are causing it to change states from holding a 1 or a 0.
Google is your friend, there are so many different detailed guides that make it pointless for anyone to attempt to explain it here.
It's a bit unintuitive, but that's not exactly how it ends up working. A more densely packed, smaller CPU design made out of smaller individual transistors is actually more power efficient. It suffers less electrical losses, and so it generates less heat. The performance and efficiency benefits to going smaller generally far outweigh any consequent heat dissipation issues that might be caused by the increased density. Removing heat from the die isn't that big a problem anyway.
There are a few reasons. Latency is the biggest usually, since it takes time to render the images after having pressed a button. Also, non-crt TV's introduce latency which makes it harder to play too. Modern emulators have a feature called run-ahead that allows the computer to 'imagine' what might happen a frame or 2 into the future and depending on what happens with the user input, will display the frames that matches what the player does. This definitely helps with latency, but it's hard to explain. I'd much rather play my super Nintendo on my CRT TV than play it on my computer, because it just feels faster to respond.
StarCraft 2 came out pretty late. I'm guessing the original game has been patched and updated extensively till 2008-2009. Also even after StarCraft 2 came out, StarCraft was still one of the more popular eSports titles.  A quick Google check seems to indicate that it's still being supported in 2021 https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Patches
Well, it can be compared to the specs of a car: speed, traction, horsepower etc. Each plays its part into determining what your car can or cannot do. - RAM is *very* fast memory and used to actually handle the data currently being handled. The webbrowser you are currently using to see this thread is loaded into the RAM in order to handle the webpage data for example. Usual format is for modern computers for normal human beings gigabyte (billions of bytes) in the range of 2 to 64 gigabyte. - Memory is often commonly used as an alternative name to RAM.  - The graphic chip / GPU handles, well, the graphical data and presentation. if you see Reddits red symbol => handled by the graphic chip. If you see a picture, a movie, anything visible => all the graphic chip. Graphic units come in two basic flavors: integrated graphic chips (very cheap, but often powerful enough to handle low level graphic requirements, for example normal webpages, office documents etc, often used in low spec computers for office spaces) and powerful and often expensive graphic cards (like the Nvida 3080) to power complex 3D applications. In todays world most modern computers have graphic cards, from very cheap graphic cards (still often better than integrated graphic chips) to extremely expensive graphic parts for complex picture/video editing often costing way more than the rest of the computer. Due to the current chip shortage due to the Pandemic and other factors high end graphic cards has become very expensive, sometimes doubling the price. For normal users like you and me graphic cards ranges from 100 USD to 3000 USD.  - Storage memory, today usually in the form of HDDs and SSDs. Different technical concepts but both are used to store massive amounts of data very cheaply, but data handling is relatively slow when compared to RAM. The usual format today is gigabyte and terabyte (1 terabyte = 1000 gigabyte (around). Modern computers have around 500 gigabyte to 4 terabyte as storage.  - The Central Processing Unit / CPU is the engine heart of your computer. While the GPU handles specialized data (like graphic data), the CPU handles basically everything else. together with the GPU the CPU is one of the core indicators of what your computer can do. Current prices are in the range of 50 to 1000 USD. - Network cards / chips: they handle the access to internet / networking decides, like your router, wifi extender etc. Todays modern computer have both cable and wifi (wireless) connections. So on a very basic level: you open your webbrowser, go to Reddit / ELI5 and write your question: - Your webbrowser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, Edge etC) is saved as data on your storage memory and inactive. - When you start the webbrowser he is loaded into your RAM and takes a portion of the RAM for itself (too many things open => RAM is full => computer has issues). - Data comes in via your network chip/card, often connected via cable to your router and from there to the internet via your internet service provider. - The GPU handles the display of what you can actually see on your scree, like the funny red Reddit mascot on the right, the blue rule section etc. - The CPU handles the actual data to be processed. Somewhere a lonely CPU thread was dedicated to actually work on this very sentence here. SYL
The "design" is very cryptic to us. It's super chaotic and soft- and hardware can't be separated. (Imagine you let a billion blind people smack their keyboards a billion times until one accidentally writes a program that does your taxes. Thats how our brain works basically. It would be impossible to then manually adjust the program for another similar task.) Also some of it's properties don't work with our material. We don't have a material that can change it's hardware during a learn process, we'd have to emulate that through software. Also we don't have a way to actually find out how a brain is programmed. Half of it is written into our DNA in a convoluted way, the other half is basically created from learning. We could try to mimic that, but we can't take an existing human brains program as we can't access it from the outside. And if you're talking just about the hardware: biochemestry is also very very complicated. We are very far away from building that stuff synthetically the way it's created from our DNA.
The ISPs aren't storing content temporarily, the communication is established directly between users to transmit parts of the file  As for the last part, the vast majority of users won't be running externally accessible services with known security flaws that can be abused.  Firewall software and routers typically make it hard to do so without intentionally setting up services that way.
FLOPS - floating point operations per second.  Or operations per second in general, basically instead of looking at the frequency of the processor, you look at the amount of work it can actually "process" in a given span of time. If you're literally trying to decide between different processors, simply look at [benchmark results](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html), processors are subjected to a standard "load" (executing a certain program) and the results of how fast are posted in the chart.
>Even though the hard drive frees up space after deleting said data.      The space the data occupies gets marked as "free", the data doesn't actually get overwritten. It's like removing the labels from your spice rack without removing the actual spices.
The number of pins can have an effect depending on the specifics of the standard. Other than that, the quality (and length) of the cable, the capabilities of the two devices sending and receiving, and the specifications on the standard itself. For example if it says 10MB per second as the standard, then manufacturers will make their stuff able to do just that.
There are indeed lots of different data busses in your computer. They use various different technologies as they are built for different things. The most basic data bus is parallel bus where each bit in the data, address and command signal have its own physical wire connecting the components together. Another wire containing the clock signal will signal when the data can be read. This is very cheap not only in the cost of components but also with timing. So it is often found in low latency applications. You also have an advantage when connecting multiple components in parallel as the address bits or data bits can easily be sepperated physically. The DDR standards of memory uses a parallel bus. As did the old PCI standard for expansion cards. To reduce the number of wires most data buses are serial though. Here there is only one data wire in addition to the clock signal. Each clock cycle will only send one bit and it is up to the receiver to assemble the bits together into the bytes that was intended. It is also possible to omit the clock wire and let the receiver figure out the clock phase from the signal itself. This way you only need two wires, signal and ground. You can get up to pretty high speeds when you do not have to syncronize lots of signals on different wires. So for example USB and I2C use these simple serial bus technology.
Basically it's all maths. There are mathematical operations that are very easy to verify if you know the answer, but very difficult to compute the answer. For example, factoring the product of very big primes. For encryption, this is the same idea. You can transform some data into gibberish by combining it in certain specific way with a key (e.g. a password). If you don't know the key, it is almost impossible to transform it back to the original text. If you know the key, it's easy to do. As you mention, that means protecting the key is very important. And sending the key to someone is quite sensitive. This is why we have also explored and found transformations that use two keys: one to transform the text in gibberish and another one to transform it back. This one, you can make the encryption key public and keep the decryption key private. It's much easier to keep a secret if you're the only one to know about it. Of course, if you don't have the key but have the gibberish and know what transformation has been used, you can just try all the possible keys or you can try to guess the private key by using the public one. But there are a LOT of possible keys and guessing the private key is one of these operations that are very difficult to do. Even the fastest computers will take several years to do either. This is basically what they mean in movies when talking about how long it takes to decrypt something. Of course, that's often heavily adjusted for dramatic effects.
256 bit refers to the length of the key used in the encryption algorithm. Think about your house key, where most have around 4 or 5 groves. If your key has 256 groves and each grove can either be down or up you end up with a lock that has 1 with 78 0s (1.1 x 10^77) worth of possible keys. It would take an insane amount of time to guess the key with a key length that long.
They don’t. A circuit board is basically just a way to connect different components, instead of connecting them by wires you attach them to a circuit board which has conductive traces between them.  PCBs can have active components on them like microcontrollers which can be programmed but they are separate from the circuit board themselves.
A computer controlled glue gun. Basically material is fed in, melted, and forced out a smaller hole. All while moving around to create shapes. X,y,z axis.
There is something in your operation system called "scheduler". Thats a part of software that coordinates wich software is executed when. So it's a hierarchy but a rather flat one. The scheduler is in charge of all the other processes.  Then those can have different priority, like, your PC should first react to user inputs and not wait for some slow calculation to finish before the mouse moves. The scheduler organizes that, and programs also tell the scheduler they are currently waiting for something else to happen first (wich means you have to consider stuff like a high priority process lending it's priority to the process it's waiting for)
Computers are complicated machines which can follow a huge variety of simple instructions (known as code) written in specific languages. Programming is basically creating recipes of these instructions for computers to do things. You can almost think of it like combinations of magic spells to make computers do special things.  Anyway these recipes (or combinations of spells, if you will) can be very large and complex, and they are made to allow computers to do cool things for people who don't know these special computer spells or recipes. So by setting the computers up with these spells, programmers make it possible for non-programmers (muggles?) to use computers for things like posting such questions and getting responses on reddit, or searching for things online, or playing games, or watching cat videos. Edit: should have also mentioned phones here, but I'm old school.
Things like that are designed by teams of engineers, with the help of digital tools of course. Typically these teams consist of people with a variety of specialisations, like electrical engineering, material science, robotics and so forth. Of course there is prototyping involved, although i imagine it is kept to a minimum for cost reasons.  When possible new factory lines just recomnbine elements from existing factory lines, but sometimes new machines need to be designed, or existing machines need to be adjusted.
People have been experimenting with programming computers to play chess [from 1950s](https://www.history.com/news/in-1950-alan-turing-created-a-chess-computer-program-that-prefigured-a-i). For a long time, computers were ***much worse*** than humans. But computer speed and memory kept [growing exponentially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) with time. Since chess is a *relatively* simple game -- (there are only very few fixed pieces and places where they can be), it turned out that on this particular problem, a cleverly programmed and a very fast computer can do better than a human. In 1980s the computer ["Belle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_(chess_machine)) could already play as a chess master, in 1990s, a specialized computer ["Deep Blue"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)) won against the world champion. Today, a system called [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero), can play against itself for a few days and thus learn starting from zero to play chess (and several other games, including Go, which is harder than chess) much better than any human does. But the real world is much more complex than chess -- [computers still cannot do many things that seem very simple to even a child](https://youtu.be/7s0CpRfyYp8?t=149)!
Originally they were read in real time. Unfortunately this meant that bumping or shaking the CD player could cause the player to be momentarily unable to read the disk, resulting in the music skipping. So in the '90s they introduced [skip protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_skip_protection) which does basically what you described. It reads ahead and stores the next few seconds worth of data, so that your walkman isn't constantly skipping when you go out for a jog.
Computers are dumb. Anything you want a computer to do, someone has to tell it to do. Even down to the level of writing these letters on a screen, someone has to make a set of instructions of how to draw letters. These instructions are "software".
Most encryption systems use a couple of prime numbers, very large prime numbers, as the basis of their algorithms.  They find these primes by choosing very large random numbers and checking to see if they are prime.
Probably just underestimating technology, or thinking fax machines were invented earlier than they were. The first proper fax machine, the Xerox Telecopier (as in commercially viable)  was developed around 1966.  And by that time we had (again commercially viable) color TV for over a decade.  If you count poof of concept stuff you can find a "printing telegraph" as far back as 1843. Like circuit boards were designed by hand, but we still had circuit boards and even integrated circuits. Would be a few more years before the first CPU was made but fax machines don't even need stuff like data compression. They can work off pure analog tech by sensing brightness converting it to a sound frequency and then the reverse when printing. Data compression was a thing added pretty quickly to get transmit times down though.
Two reasons: 1. PCs have been standardized a long, long time ago. This wasn't always the case - in the past you had competing hardware like IBM PC, Commodore, Atari and Macintosh, and they were not compatible with each other. 2. Drivers. The operation systems needs drivers to communicate with the hardware. PC operating systems can afford to include many different types of drivers, but mobile OS, due to lack of resources, have to limit themselves to only the required ones.
Either the monitors are all connected to the same computer, in which it doesn't matter as the keyboard will only be typing on the program that is focused, or the monitors belong to different computers and the keyboard likely has a connection or shortcut to swap between the two.
Theoretical calculations tend to ignore itty bitty factors that shouldn't make a difference, but semi conductors are at a size where those tiny variations end up making a difference so the plot of measured values and calculated values end up quite a bit different If you're at 90nm and try to hop to 20nm what you find is that you're fighting with 30 different quantum effects simultaneously. You've got light not being small enough to craft the shapes you need, you've got quantum tunneling through the gates, and an assortment of other issues If you go from 90 to 65 then you can work to improve your immersion lithography.  Going from 65 to 45 you can work on improving your gate oxide to fix tunneling.  From 45 to 32 maybe you work on Extreme UV for your lithography. By solving a couple problems at a time you can continue to make progress forward.  It is often faster to fix a series of single faults than to attempt to fix multiple issues at the same time. If your car has no fuel, a bad fuel pump, bad spark plugs, a bad coil pack, *and* bad airflow sensors then its going to take you a longggg time to figure out why it won't start up, far longer than just resolving any single fault would
Encryption takes a text and performs some kind of alteration to it to make in unreadable. But this alteration is reversable if you know the right information (like a password). For a very simple example (one which kids often come up with) take a number and "add" that to every letter in the message you want to encrypt. For example if the number is 1, make any A to a B, any B to a C etc. If the number is 2, make A to C etc.   If we have a number 3 and want to encrypt "HELLO", we would have:   H + 3 = K   E + 3 = H   L + 3 = O   O + 3 = R    The encrypted message would be KHOOR, which you can decrypt using the same method (K - 3 = H etc.)   Of course, modern encryption methods are a lot more sophisticated and complex, relying on complex one way operations in maths to encrypt, but the idea of:   1. Take message   2. Perform alteration   3. Send encrypted message that nobody who doesn't know how to reverse the alteration can't read   4. Receive encrypted message and decrypt it with the information you have stays the same.
My understanding is that it uses your graphics processor to perform complex math problems and if you're correct you get a treat.
It all depends on your motherboard, and your personal skill. First, let's look at what memory is. Modern memory is like a warehouse full of buckets which are either filled or emptied to store information. The computer can ask you to fill, empty or check a bucket - but doing so takes time (latency), and you can only start new stuff at certain intervals (clock speed), plus it takes a certain amount of energy to fill, empty or check a bucket (voltage). You might design a quicker bucket layout, so that you can check each bucket quicker - or you might design a better central bucket controller, so you can get new instructions quicker. That's great, but what happens when the requests are more than you can handle? Maybe the computer demands that you take 10 seconds to check each bucket, but it realistically should take 13. You can try to work faster, but you might accidentally knock over a bucket, or spill water into another adjacent bucket, or you might say a bucket is full when it's empty. If the instructions come in too quickly, you might just be unable to cope and shut down - similarly, if you end up without enough energy to change buckets, that'll cause issues too. Memory is the same - asking it to perform faster than it can can lead to errors in the data that's stored, errors in the data that's sent to the CPU, and so on. Give it too much voltage, and you might even burn something on the RAM. Modern memory can automatically tell the computer how quickly it can run, how long it takes to handle a request and how much voltage it needs. However, every single stick in a DDR4 system must run at the same voltage, latency and clock speed. If the computer chooses to run using the worst specs of the group, then you'll lose performance. If it chooses to run using the best, then there's a chance that the worst can't keep up. In a nightmare scenario, you might have one stick of low-clocked but low-latency RAM (such as a 2400 MHz kit which runs with 16 "cycles" of latency), and a second higher-clocked but very high latency RAM (such as a 3600 MHz kit which needs 20 cycles to be stable at 2400 MHz). In this case, your motherboard needs to work out that it has to use the clock speed of one stick and the latency of the second - which is possible but still messy, especially with older kits and motherboards. Similarly, if you try and overclock your RAM, you do need to be careful about the potential for your two sticks to have different capabilities, especially if they're different brands. One brand's memory may run fine at the rated speed but crash when overclocked, while another brand's memory might be perfectly happy to run faster. ____ These instability concerns are honestly relatively minor though. You can generally mix frequencies and brands without losing performance when compared to just using the *worst* of your sticks in every slot. That's the biggest issue with mixing sticks though - if you have a 100 dollar stick in slot A and a 300 dollar stick in slot B, you get the same performance as a 100 dollar stick in both slots, for double the price.
Binary math, each combination in bytes it 8 1s or 0s.  Giving you 255 permutations. Each permutation is assigned a key stroke.
It’s a unique ID for your phone account. The card itself has a (tiny) microchip inside with a unique number hard coded inside it, along with some information about what cell phone company issued it.  There are a bazillion iPhones in the world. The SIM card is what tell the cell phone company and the phone “this phone belongs to this account on this network with this provider with this phone number”.  This is why moving the SIM card to a new phone moves your phone number…the SIM is really what identifies you as “you” to the cell phone network. The phone is just a hardware wrapper on the SIM so it can interact with the cell network.
Video compression is the only reason HD Netflix and YouTube can exist A 1 hour well compressed 1080p video might be just 1 GB. Uncompressed it would be over 1TB 4k gets even worse. Uncompressed 4k video is 1.5 GB/second! You don't have the internet bandwidth to handle streaming an uncompressed video file Lossless compression has less obvious uses because the compression ratio is relatively low, but lossy compression is used every day. A better compression algorithm can give you either a smaller file with the same quality or better quality in the same file size or faster processing which can be quite valuable for large files
clustering is just a generic term used to describe multiple PC's being used for a single/similar purpose.  they all need some way to communicate, typically instantaneously but that's not a hard requirement.  they can be on the same local network or even be connected across the internet or even connected offline with data being manually transferred across them, ie sneakernet.
Sure. However that only tells you if it is possible with that specific starting condition. The problem asks if it is possible with *all* starting positions. There are an infinite number of them. We need a general proof that shows it is always possible, not just for a finite number of cases. Wikipedia has a couple of proofs for n=2 and n=3.  In regard to "cutting trough four dimensional space" remember that mathmatics do not line up with reality all the time. Mathmatics frequently work with dimensions as large as they want because maths are not restricted by physical reality.
WiFi 6 is the new branding for WiFi revisions. You used to see WiFi routers marked as supporting 802.11ac or 802.11 a/b/g/n which was clear as mud to normal people.  The WiFi Alliance went through and rebranded the customer facing ones so 802.11ax became WiFi 6 and 802.11ac was WiFi 5 These markings are distinctly different from 5G (5th generation phone data connection) and 5 GHz WiFi. WiFi has supported 5GHz connections for a long time, but we didn't used to have enough data to move to saturate that bandwidth, that's changed over time and now most routers make separate 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks in case you need moderate speed/long range or high speed/moderate range The biggest improvement for WiFi 6 is in being able to talk to multiple devices at the same time.  Previously your router sent all messages in all directions which meant your neighbor's network interfered with yours and you interfere with them as well as your phone cutting into your laptop's bandwidth.  WiFi 6 (assuming everything is WiFi 6) supports beam forming so the messages for your phone are sent towards your phone and allows for data to be sent to the laptop at the exact same time if its in a different enough direction.
Here's an analogy for you: * You need to store a binary number in a loaf of bread. * You store the number by toasting some of the slices of bread but not others. * Someone asks you to erase the bread. You do this by scraping the burnt bits off the toasted slices. See now how it might be fairly easy to retrieve the data you erased from the bread? Hard Drives (actual magnetic disk based ones) are the same, but with magnetically oriented rust.
The table’s just simplifying the presentation of the address for human readability. Its representation in the computer is in binary as you’d expect but most humans aren’t great at converting binary to decimal numbers on the fly. So simplifying it allows them to convey the important parts of how the table works without the learner having to deal with unnecessary complexity.
When people need to store something they rent a spot at one of those storage places. Cloud storage is the same: you rent space on someone else’s computer to store your stuff
Graphics in games, unlike video, have to be created on the fly. Anything you see on the screen has to be calculated, drawn, and projected to the screen in 1/60th (or whatever the framerate is) of a second. That's not a lot of time to do what is really quite a lot of work. Better graphics require more computations that need to be done, more pixels that need to be told what color they ought to be, more triangles that need to be drawn.  A more powerful system has more computing power than a less powerful system, and can thus get the more complicated work for better graphics done faster.
Sort of hard to do if you don't understand a good bit about programming. I'll take a swipe. C++ is a programming language that's been around for a long time, my sources say it was released in 1985. It is what we call a "low level" language. That means it makes the programmer have to think about things closer to how the computer works than "high level" languages. Think of the difference between baking your own cookies from scratch and buying premade cookie dough as the difference between "low level" and "high level". "Pointers" are a name for programming variables that represent memory addresses, because instead of being a value themselves they "point" to values. The difference is normal variables are like "an apple", which is a physical thing you can have, but pointer variables are like "the apple in bin A1", it's just some directions on how to find an apple.  C++ is notorious for letting developers do very clever tricks with pointers that can perform very fast. But if you get something wrong with pointers, the program can fail in very, very cryptic ways and it might not be obvious what went wrong. "Macros" are a feature of the C++ compiler that let a programmer deal with repetitive code by sort of letting C++ copy and paste code on behalf of the developer. So maybe there's a tricky way to use pointers to do something, the developer might write a macro once to do it, then be sure everywhere the macro is used there aren't mistakes. For example, "Hi, my name is <name>." is sort of like a macro for a greeting. In C++, I could write a macro such that if I typed `#GREETING("Alice")`, the compiler would replace it with, "Hi, my name is Alice." 2008 was a LONG time ago in programming. There have been many new versions of C++ since then, and each version tries to provide new, better ways to take care of the things programmers tend to get wrong. In particular, there have been a lot of new kinds of ways to handle pointers that help programmers maintain good performance but avoid really common mistakes.  So. This meme is from the viewpoint of someone who is used to modern C++ but was given a program written in 2008 that needs to be updated. Back in 2008, the nice, new features weren't present. So to understand what's going on, the developer has to understand how macros are interacting with pointers.  This is sort of like if a recipe book's first 100 pages were just codewords for things, then the rest of the book only used the code words. For example, a cookie recipe might look like: 1. Combine dry ingredients. 2. Cream the butter. 3. Fold dry ingredients. 4. Bake at standard temperature for standard interval. That's terse, but you'll first have to look up what the dry ingredients are, what "cream the butter" means, what "fold" means in this context, and what "standard temperature" and "standard interval" mean. That's a lot harder than if it was all spelled out for you. Now imagine you have that cookbook and you're being asked to find mistakes in recipes and fix them. Long story short: they feel like C++ developers in 2008 were lunatics, the same kind of people who'd combine Mountain Dew and Doritos in a blender then drink them.
You keep extra information. You can count how many 1s in a byte - if its odd, store a 1, if it's even store a 0. Now you can detect any time a single bit flips, as you go from odd to even, using just one bit. But how to detect where that bit flip is? Well, if you do the same trick, but only with the first four bits, you can tell whether its in the first or second half. Do the same for the first two bits in each half and every other half, you get the exact bit you can flip back. This requires four bits. This is an extremely simple example. There are all sorts of other error detection/correction techniques. Ethernet, for example, uses cyclic redundancy checks, which can be designed to detect "burst errors", errors where multiple bits in a row get flipped.
The power delivery specification requires the device and power supply to communicate what power profiles are used.   A power source that can provide a higher voltage profile than the maximum the device supports just won't use that higher voltage profile. 60hz refers to the frequency of the AC supply on the input side.   Many power supplies support both 50hz and 60hz at either 120 or 240v AC, making that rarely an issue.
they use HUGE data storage. literally whole rooms consisting of special shelves filled with big HDDs from top to bottom compression isn't always a good way to do thing - it takes time to decompress and recompress, as well as extra read/writes, so if you need to service the data fast, you can't compress it too well. also, data storage is cheaper then it seems. on one of the cloud services I use, you can buy a lifetime subscription to a certain space for a price of 1.5-2 hard drives of the same space. they could literally go and buy those hard drives, plug them in, dedicate them to me specifically and it will work out for them
They’re usually not CPU-limited, they’re GPU-limited. It takes a lot more resources to draw the picture and display it on the monitor than it does to run the AI of the dumb-as-rocks bad guys, so the refresh rate of the game is typically limited by graphics processing in the GPU. The CPU will thus spend much of its time just idling, waiting for the GPU to render a frame. Some games in the RTS (think Starcraft) and ARPG (think Diablo) genres can put more strain on a CPU due to the volume of enemies and their AI routines.  Whether they will actually be allowed to peg the CPU or not will depend on how the computer allocates resources, but they will definitely lag with too many units on screen as the CPU struggles with so many concurrent AI calculations.
Primarily because of the varying settings. All xboxes or all ps5s or whatever console are all fairly uniform in every part of their hardware except maybe overall harddrive space. They process things all the same way so there's no need to account for variance. PCs vary so much in processing power and capabilities that you'd more likely have trouble finding two that are exactly the same.  The game producers have to account for this by creating a game that looks nice enough that it doesn't appear to be outdated, but keep requirements low enough that users with lower end PCs can still run them even if they have to change the graphics settings to do so. If they don't do this then they run the risk of alienating one group or the other and missing out on potential profit
Because consoles are sold at a loss, knowing that they'll make the money back in game sales.
DNA is just a really long string of different molecules, called nucleotides, one after another. Furthermore, since there are 4 different ones used in nature (there have been synthetic ones that use up to 8), you can store 2 bits per nucleotide. So 2 bits on a single tiny molecule, it doesn't get much smaller. And since cells have a natural way to replicate the DNA in order to divide, copying the data is as simple as adding a DNA polymerase and more loose nucleotides and heating the thing up. For the most part. You need some more stuff, but that's the principle at least.  The more challenging task is to convert the information back into something that computers can use. >is it always human DNA? All DNA is the same chemically. What makes a DNA "human" is purely the data on it. This question is a bit like "is every string of bits a Word document"
RAM = random access memory = a temporary storage for files and data. Having more RAM usually means you can store more game data at one time and don't have to keep loading it, which can slow the game's performance down. Everything on a system is using your RAM, too, from the operating system to any other programs you have open, so having *more* RAM (or just closing down more programs) means having more space for that sweet delicious game data.  That is just one factor on game performance, though - you can have 32 GB of RAM but if you have a slow processor or older GPU then you're not going to be pulling 100+ frames per second at 4K resolution on the latest releases.
First: there is a clear cut worldwide definition of *Data Science*, and is is often mingled with *Data Analytics* and *Data Engineering*. Each of these fields usually shows a specialization, and depending on how complex your job is, in can include all or nothing of it ... or company X calls the same job completely by another name. - Imagine that you have a worldwide pandemic with a deadly virus. Imagine that the science- and medical research institutes are desperately working together to find a vaccine. With that the data of millions of probes, studies, experiments and data of 7+ billion humans have to be analyzed, in order to get usable data. - Imagine that you are a tourism / travel provider, one of the biggest, and each day you process millions of requests and data entries from airlines, hotels, customers, guests, business clients, tour providers. Among your data sets of billions of transactions and data entries, which offer is the best for which customer, aka: where do you make the most money ... and would you make more money if you change things here and there. Like ... early reservation bonuses. - Imagine that you are one of the worlds biggest customer support systems (in your field), working on millions of tickets each year. Your manager wants to create a better, more cost-efficient system. So you look at the data, you have X people, Y requests, and Z time. How do you optimize that? In the end: you have a giant set of data. You actually want to know how to improve your thing, and you can go of course with your "feelings" and "experience", or you can use the data your business creates and try to find out what actually happens on a large scale and where small changes could have the biggest impacts. *In case of #3 we found out that actually not providing a 24/7 service but a 8-22 service with a higher ratio for live contacts around lunch and evening time was far better for the customer, due to increased coverage when most of the customers would actually attempt to contact us, resulting in a massive CSAT increase due to vastly reduced waiting times and better FCR.* SYL
So, first thing to realise is that Cryptography deals with numbers. You probably already know this, but this is ELI5 so I'll mention it to be sure. So let's take a 2 digit number and multiply by 101, or 201, or 745301. Any number ending with 01. Then throw away all but the last 2 digits. You get what you start with. We can split this number into factors. What 2 numbers can we multiply together to get 201? 67, and 3 work.  We can do this multiply and keep the last digits trick with each of these. 3 is our public key. 67 is our private key So start with 61.     Multiply by our public key to get 183.      Keep the last 2 digits as our "encrypted" number - 83 To get and multiply by our private key of 67 83x67=5561.     Take the last two digits and we have the number we started with. So that illustrates the basic idea of asymmetric functions. But we can't use multiplication because it's too easy to reverse. We can do something similar with different mathematical operations though. Using powers of primes, in different numerical bases is one such operation. And there are formulas to generate  the numbers that will work for this.
Lossless compression has an additional step involved to de- or encode it. And it's a dynamic one that works out differently each time. For example you compress a book. The compression algorithm notices that the book contains the word "the" quite often, so it replaces it with a new symbol and puts that in some archive to translate it back again. (The redundant information is that "the" uses 3 symbols instead of just one) That archive will look different for every book though. And before the user can read it, the algorithm first has to translate it back to normal english again. A step that will always take some extra time.
From the man page: Whenever there is a transition from kernel-mode to user-mode   execution (e.g., on return from a system call or scheduling of a   thread onto the CPU), the kernel checks whether there is a   pending unblocked signal for which the process has established a   signal handler.  If there is such a pending signal, the following   steps occur: \[...\] ELI5 explanation: The computer doesn't just "launch and forget" a program. It constantly switches between executing the OS and executing stuff within processes. So, when a program is launched, special functions called signal handlers are embedded within it. Whenever the OS turns its attention to the program to execute it further, it first checks its own set of active signals. If there's something related to this process, it executes the handler first and then resumes the process... unless the handler stopped it, of course.
That's how the theory goes yeah.  Wear levelling spreads writes across the disk to average out wear in particular memory cells. The bigger the disk, the bigger the possible number of writes before you've used a 'layer' of wear and you go onto the next 'layer'.
They don't. Computers don't understand anything in the sense that you or I do. We \*design\* computers so that they respond in predictable ways to specific inputs. Programming is the art/science of setting up the right inputs to get the outputs we want. The only language computers actually "understand" is machine code...specific sets of 1/0 (on/off) patterns that activate/deactivate specific circuits in the computer to do simple operations: move a value from memory to the CPU, add two numbers, store a value, compare if one value is bigger than another, etc. All programming languages and compilers eventually get distilled down to sequences of machine code stored in memory and the CPU just blindly executes them without have any idea what they mean.
The general idea is to design masks of the needed on-chip structures that are relatively large, then photographically or otherwise reduce them to an extremely small size. The reduced masks are then used together with energy sources and photosensitive coatings to control how materials are deposited or etched away on the silicon chip. For example, the chip may be coated with a conductive layer, then coated with a photoresist layer, then covered with a mask and exposed to light, after which the photoresist layer is washed away in the areas where light hit it. Now, the chip is etched with acid to selectively eat away the conductive layer, forming wires where the photoresist layer remained intact. The above is vastly oversimplified, but you get the general idea.
3DNAND flash chips (where the OS) is stored, come with standard pinouts.  There are machines where you can load it with hundreds (maybe even thousands) of packaged 3DNAND ICs at a time, dump the same data onto all of them and then they get soldered to the logic board, which would be much faster and efficient than manually plugging each phone into a usb port post manufacturing.
A hardware wallet is a seperate piece of removeable hardware, like a USB drive, that contains your cryptocurrency (bitcoins, etc.). It's not \*safe\*, it's saf\*er\*. With most cryptocurrency, if you get ahold of the private keys then you get the currency. There is no way to recover it. So if you store your bitcoins or whatever on your regular internet connected device and you get hacked, they're gone forever. And there's always a non-zero risk of getting hacked by an external party with a device connected to the internet. A hardware wallet isn't connected to anything except when you're using it, and it never so the "threat surface" is much smaller...it can't be hacked via any external entity, they have to gain physical access to the hardware wallet, the time window to attack it when it's connected to your computer is very short, and it typically runs specialized software/encryption so it's more difficult to hack (and easier to secure) than a regular commercial-grade computer. That is much more difficult, but not impossible. Hence "safer" but not "safe". You can go all the way to printing out the private keys on paper or some other physical medium then destroying the electronic files...that's truly unhackable, the only way to get it is to physically steal/surveil the paper.
A couple of things: Virtualization is not the same as emulation. They are similar but mostly virtualization is creating virtual version of the actual hardware it is running one, while emulation is using software to pretend to be completely different hardware. Using virtualization is being able to pretend that your x86 based computer is three different PCs. Emulation allows your PC to pretend to be a SNES or a PlayStation. ISO files were originally the files used tow rite to CDs. They were away to store on your HDD what was written on a CD or what should be written to a CD. As optical drives became less and less common it became more and more common to use software to read those files and pretend to the computer that it was a hardware optical drive while doing so. Nowadays the functionality to mount ISO files as 'pretend' CD/DVD drives is integrated into the OS. ROMs are just a files that contains the contents of game cartridges. Emulation software that can simulate those game consoles can read those files and pretend they are cartridges being loaded into the console. This concept was later extended to proprietary optical disc formats. One thing to keep in mind though is that unlike CDs and DVDs, cartridges were not just data storage, they also sometimes added new hardware like extra memory and 3D graphic or sound chips. This can usually be emulated too though.
The fax machine basically scans an image, traditionally a document, and then converts that into a data signal that can be sent over a phone line, where another fax machine answers the phone call and receives the data signal. In most cases, fax machines are set to automatically receive and being printing out the image that was sent, though you can set them to only answer manually, so that you don't print out faxes unless you press the button.  Basically, it's sort of a low-tech way of taking a photo with your phone and texting the image to someone.
TL;DR: LCD < LED < QLED (quantum dot) < OLED HDR means "High Dynamic Range". The screen is able to create a wide range of colors and can produce deeper blacks (instead of muddy grays) and brighter colors (without washing them out). The screen hierarchy above also reflects how well they do HDR. HDR also has different standards: HDR 10 (typically cheaper) < Dolby Vision ELI5 of *how* the screens work, and some specific pros and cons: ####LCD   LCD screens have a big, white backlight that passes through an LCD panel. The LCD panel is, in a nutshell, a bunch of filters to change the white backlight into red, green, and blue pixels. Since these filters can't become 100% opaque, **LCD screens have trouble with darker colors.** ####LED   LED screens are just LCD screens with an LED backlight. LEDs are **more energy efficient**. Since you can't really have a single giant LED for the backlight, they use a panel with a bunch of LEDs. **This means the screen can selectively dim certain LEDs to make dark colors better and darker.**   ####QLED   The downside of LED backlights is the LEDs aren't white. LED screens use blue LEDs with a yellow filter to make it white, which then goes through the filters of the LCD panel. Obviously, going through so many filters isn't great.   QLED replaces the yellow filter with a layer of tiny crystals (the "quantum dots"). These crystals are *fluorescent*, which means they glow when they absorb light. Some of these crystals glow red, and the others glow green. Combined with the blue LEDs, you get white light. This white light is purer than what you get with ordinary LED screens, resulting in **better colors and even greater energy efficiency**. ####OLED   OLED screens don't have a backlight. The *sub*-pixels themselves are the light. There's no need for filters, OLEDs create red, blue, and green directly. This also means they can individually dim or turn off sub-pixels for dark colors and black. **They have the best color accuracy and deepest blacks. But they're expensive, and not as bright (for now)**.
RAID basically means using multiple hard drives to provide, primarily, data backup and recovery functionality. That's the main benefit. The downsides are the cost of having additional hard drives and needing specialized hardware/software to implement RAID functionality. RAID 0 basically takes your data and spreads it out evenly over multiple disks. This does not provide for backup and recovery, but can improve performance and allows the computer to access data faster. The downside is the loss of any single hard drive in the array makes the entire array unusual as your data is broken up across all of them. RAID 1 is a simple mirroring of one hard drive to another. This provides the simplest form of backup and recovery. If one hard drive fails, you have an exact copy of it. But it isn't very efficient. RAID 2 is basically just a different implementation of RAID 0. RAID 0 distributes data across individual hard drives in clumps called "blocks" whereas RAID 2 does it on a bit-by-bit basis. However it does implement a simple form of error correction whereas RAID 0 does not. RAID 3 is like RAID 0 and RAID 2, but it operates at the byte level (rather than block or bit) and one of the disks of the array is dedicated for *parity*. The parity disk examples the data on all the other disks and stores the parity of that data. For example, with RAID 3 we're storing information byte-by-byte. Let's say the first byte on the first disk is 01010101 and the first byte on the second disk is 00001111 and the first byte on the third disk is 00111100. The first byte of the parity disk looks at the first byte on all the other disks and counts how many "1"s appear at each bit place. It then stores a "0" if there are an even amount of "1"s and stores a "1" if there are an odd amount of "1"s like so: &#x200B; |First Disk|01010101| |:-|:-| |Second Disk|00001111| |Third Disk|00111100| |Parity Disk|01100110| Having a parity disk allows the recovery of a single hard drive. If a hard drive fails, you can construct what the missing byte would be by looking at the remaining bytes, the parity, then constructing the missing byte by using whatever bits are necessary to make the parity correct. RAID 4 is like RAID 3 but operates on block level. RAID 5 is like RAID 4 but the parity blocks are distributed across all of the hard drives in the array rather than being confined to one. The parity blocks only come into play when a disk fails, so having all of the parity blocks on a single hard drive means you have an entire hard drive that is hardly being used, increasing the wear and tear on the other hard drives. By distributing the parity blocks throughout, you include all the hard drives and distribute this stress more evenly. RAID 6 extends RAID 5 by having two parity blocks per data block and therefore can support the loss of up to two hard drives.
Before there were launchers you had to manually Install patches and shit. Nobody wants to do this anymore. Launchers are an easy way to configure and update games.
No matter what you do to the game, at some point unencrypted program code HAS to be stored in memory so the computer can execute it.  So while the developer of a game can encrypt their executable code, they cannot escape that for the game to run it has to decrypt portions and store them in memory.  There are tools called "memory debuggers" that let a person see the contents of the computer's memory live. A person can use that to find where the decrypted code is being stored. With a lot of work and careful study, the person can see enough of this code to figure out how the game determines if it should consider itself licensed. With more work and more careful study, they might be able to determine how the code is encrypted and be able to decrypt it, or at least how to make modifications to the encrypted code. The only way this could be made "bulletproof" is if program code encryption were a feature of the CPU and memory. In that model, the program would put encrypted code in memory and the CPU would on-the-fly decrypt it in special internal memory that debuggers are not able to access. I think the reason we don't do this is: * It would be very, very complicated and not every program cares about copy protection this much. * It would be harder for the people writing the game to debug it during development. * Somehow, the CPU and the program would have to negotiate how the program is encrypted and how it should be decrypted, and a cracker could intercept that negotiation and use it to determine how to decrypt the code.  Basically, the game developer *can't* make the game uncrackable. Their goal is to make it hard enough to crack that most people who want to play the game will have bought it by the time a crack is released. Or, if their game's performance is judged by how much it sells "at release", they only need the crack to take longer than their release window. (Movies are like that too: often only the first 2 weeks of ticket sales "matter" in the opinion of the people who decide if it did a good job. So as long as it takes 2 weeks or longer for pirated copies to be produced, the studio isn't very concerned.)
It let's you multitask much more efficiently. For example you can have a YouTube video playing while you work or play a video game or whatever.
The scanner is actually reading the white spaces between the lines and depending how big they are they assign a number to it. So when you scan something you'll get a number and then that number is assigned to something else like an apple
Imagine you are an artist looking through a window. You see a 3D scene in front of you. Then you take your paint palette and a tiny brush (you are a pointillist) and cover the window glass with dots of paint that exactly match the color of what you see behind them. When you're done, you'll have a 2D painting of a 3D scene. Fundamentally, this is what computers are doing when they show (or "render") 3D scenes. They have a lot of clever algorithms to speed up the process, but essentially they are looking at each pixel on the screen and saying, "what color would this pixel be if the user was looking at the 3D scene through it?"
Two basic examples I know of. 1. “Glue gun” deposition:   Using what is basically a fancy heat gun, a plastic material is melted onto a surface. The gun deposits it in the shape of the object you want controlled by a computer. The plastic sets very quickly so a new layer can be deposited on top. So on and so forth the layers build up creating a 3D object.  2. Photochemical reaction:    This time the build surface is placed upside down onto a bath of a liquid which solidifies when exposed to a laser light. Computers control lasers which solidify the liquid right next to the build surface in the desired shape. The build surface is then raised slightly above the liquid. The lasers again solidify the liquid next to the initial layer. So on and so forth the build surface is raised as the lasers solidify the liquid into the 3D object. edit: intro and words
a game engine is a tool used to create a video game.  Think of it a bit like an artist's studio.  If you walk into the studio of a sculpter he will have all the tools needed to make a sculpture, arranged in a sensible manner, with materials and such to assist.  If you walk into the studio of a painter she might have a few of the tools needed to make a sculpture, but not all, and they may be hard to find as she really never uses them (or uses them for something else). Thus game engines are usually designed for types of games but if you want to make a space combat flight simulator the tools available in an engine mostly designed for 2D side scroller games wouldn't be the best.
It's like a computer, in a computer. Imagine an office where a total of 4 workers do their work. Manager (user) comes in, tells 2 of them to do a completely other project, and raises cubicles around them. That's the virtual machine. It uses a part of the computer's resources to run an almost completely separate machine which is quarantined almost completely from the original. This creates a safe space to run viruses or other stuff because they won't harm the base computer, as there is no way to access any files from the virtual machine that are outside of it.
Because all the 3D rending was done on another machine. You watching video game playback is no different than streaming any HD video. If your computer can playback video, doesn’t matter what the video is.
In comparison to what's available on the USB 3.0 type a connector, there are two additional pairs for super speed data, plus a few extra pins for non-USB use. This allows USB 3.2's "dual lane" (forgot official name) mode, using all four superspeed data pairs (two in each direction), or situations such as displayport and USB simultaneously over the same connector.
In most cases, it's simply a texture. So when the game is made, digital models are made, limited by the technology of the creators and the hardware it'll be running on. For a HD version, they make new models and simply replace the old versions. In some cases they just run it through a computer and tell that to just make it X bigger and crisper, but that's generally considered a bad way of doing it.
Suppose you have a .txt file with partial lyrics to The Rolling Stones’ song ‘Start Me Up’: >	* If you start me up If you start me up I'll never stop If you start me up If you start me up I'll never stop I've been running hot You got me ticking gonna blow my top If you start me up If you start me up I'll never stop never stop, never stop, never stop* Now let’s do the following: let xxx = ‘If you start me up’; let yyy = ‘never stop’; So we represent this part of the song with xxx and yyy, and the lyrics become: >	* xxx xxx I'll yyy xxx xxx I'll yyy I've been running hot You got me ticking gonna blow my top xxx xxx I'll yyy yyy, yyy, yyy* Which gets you a smaller net file size with the same information.
Watching a video is like holding a flip book and flipping through the pages.  Playing a video game is drawing the flip book as you flip it.
How binary works: It's base-2 arithmetic. It works like base-10, which you are used to, but with only 2 numbers. So in base-10, you count from 0 to 9 and then append a 0 and count from 10 to 19, and so on. In base-2, you count 0 1, then append a zero and count again. You just have to append zeroes faster. Here's a little conversion table, decimal to binary: 0 = 0 1 = 1 2 = 10 3 = 11 4 = 100 5 = 101 6 = 110 7 = 111 8 = 1000 9 = 1001 10 = 1010 And so on. In this way you need only two digits to count as high as you want. Each number representing a 0 or a 1 is called a bit. It comes from Binary digIT. One byte contains 8 bits, and it can represent any integer from 0 to 255, like this: 0 = 00000000 ... 255 = 11111111 Now it's a matter of assigning numbers to everything else. For instance, you could say that a "1" represents an "A" and a "2" represents a "B" and so on. You continue with something like this and you assign numbers to all the letters, all the numbers, lower and upper case, emojis, and what have you. You also assign numbers as addresses to each pixel on a screen, and you assign numbers to various colors. Computers are really good at repetitive calculation, so by representing everything as numbers we can easily store, retrieve, and operate on anything.  Languages, as in programming languages, are not that much different; at the most basic, there are very simple languages that use numbers to represent simple instructions. For instance, a "+" could be assigned a number, and so could a "-" and a "x" and so on. There are mathematical operations that you learn further along, perhaps in high school or in college, that have names like AND and OR and NOT; there are others, a bit more advanced, that have names like IF and ELSE. Put it all together and you can write programs that can operate on all those symbols according to rules that you define. The PC parts don't really translate things between concepts and 0 and 1. They operate mathematically on bits, and that is all. It is the collection of those bits, and the way we choose to organize them and display them, that has meaning. This paragraph makes sense to you if you speak English; to the computer it is just a series of numbers, with no particular meaning. There is a lot of software between you and me that makes it appear to you as letters on a screen; and you are the one doing the interpretation. How different parts communicate with each others is easy: they transmit signals to each other using wires. It is a bit more complex than that, and the wires are really tiny, but in the end as part of running your game the CPU will send signals through wires through wires to the memory, which will reply by sending memory contents; it will operate on some of those contents and send it as signals on wires to the GPU, wich will turn those into instructions to light pixels in a certain order and color and so on.
It's sort of like the nervous system that connects and regulates all of the other components.
Put simply - the power supply provides a voltage - an amount of electric pressure. The amount of electric current is allowed to flow is up to it the device.  A fridge generally uses a simple thermostat - a switch connected to a thermometer. When the fridge is cold enough, the thermometer turns the fridge off. Then when it warms up again, the thermometer turns the fridge back on. A CPU, if it was doing nothing, would draw almost no power. But a short burst of current flows through the tiny switches inside it every time the switches change state, from on to off, high to low. When a CPU (or a part of the CPU) is sleeping, which it does whenever there are no tasks for it - it sits idle, not using power. Then when there are some tasks to do, the switches inside it start turning from on to off repeatedly to do the task, drawing power. Modern CPUs also change the speed they are running at depending on how much work there is to be done - lower speed, lower GHz, mean less switch changes per second, so less power drawn.
Most of the time it's because even though it looks like it's booted up....it's still loading tons of stuff still. All the stuff in the system tray loads after the OS does. So you have to wait for all that stuff to load. Once it's done it seems like it's running faster because you don't have to share system resources (harddrive memory, cpu) with stuff that's still trying to load from boot.
The Internet/Cloud isn't some mystical magical place.  It's just server hardware, interconnected.  Servers have hard disks.  Servers connect to large storage arrays.  So storage is unlimited because you just buy more storage arrays. At work I'm in the process of spending another $1 million on storage arrays this year, to add another Petabyte or so of storage for our needs.   As long as we can still make storage, we can continue to add to what's available on The Internet/Cloud
You have to put it somewhere, and it's the easy way to do it. The name for the documents folder is language specific, so you have to ask the OS "What's the full path to the documents folder?". Since there's no such function for saved games specifically, you have to code your own logic for that, and it'll be somewhat inconsistent with the rest of the system. You'll get a Japanese system with Japanese folder names, and "Saved Games". It's also a common, well known location that is likely to get backed up by the user if they backup anything, and which can be shared across computers, which can be convenient.
Because the amount of data that can be stored goes up with the square of the number of blocks. If a QR code is 21 blocks tall (smallest size) it can encode very little data, but the largest size (177 blocks tall) can encode over 4 kilobytes because it contains approximately thirty thousand blocks (it is limited to four kilobytes because many of those blocks are used to help the camera decode the QR code and don’t actually store any data).
They don’t. They are programmed to understand how much the machine moves based on the rotation of a gear or ball screw.
To continue your book analogy, it's pushing together all the useless info - spaces in this example and printing it on a fraction if the paper. However it also makes a note of all the words it smudged together so if needed it could print the full book
So, there are two parts. The part of "why don't you get a speedup", and the part of "why don't companies bother". The first answer is this:  Synchronizing data across GPUs is *incredibly* hard, because they can't easily communicate with each other. Normally, when rendering a frame, all parts of the GPU can access the same common memory (VRAM) through a very high speed interface (think hundreds of GB/s). The PCI-Express interface, on the other hand, is a small fraction of that (a few dozen GB/s if you're lucky). So when you're trying to cooperatively render a frame using two or more GPUs, you're suddenly talking about needing to synchronize data with a fraction of the amount of memory bandwidth you're used to. **EDIT:** Earlier GPUs used dedicated bridges for multi-GPU setups, but these also maxed out at a few GB/s - and got phased out in favor of PCI Express for later versions of SLI/Crossfire. In either case, the point stands that these interconnects are still much slower than direct memory access, for a number of reasons too technical for an ELI5. Historically, multi-GPU has usually tried to apply tricks such as alternating frames between GPUs, or having each GPU render half the frame, but these are becoming increasingly unfeasible as modern video games involve *screen-space* processing more and more heavily, for things like anti-aliasing, ambient occlusion, reflections or motion blur. With screen-space processing you generally need to be able to access other parts of the previous (or even same) frame. Today's drivers and video games just don't even bother. Now on to the second part: Why doesn't anybody bother? The answer is that there's just... no point. If you want a more powerful GPU, make a more powerful GPUs. GPUs are already massively parallel, so you can just trivially scale them up. The only niche multi-GPU ever filled was the niche of people who want even more power than the most powerful single GPUs on the market. Companies solved this by just offering more expensive GPUs. The Nvidia RTX 3090 has an MSRP of $1500. It **is** the equivalent of what used to be a 3-way SLI setup. The Nvidia TITAN RTX is even more expensive ($2500). Consider: The GTX 480 was only $500 at the time of its release The only thing you're gaining from a multi-card setup is overhead.
The main idea is to find patterns and ways to represent those patterns using less space… For example, which is shorter aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa or 20a
[This is what electronics is](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/1/3/b/5/8/50cba0dcce395fb716000000.jpg), a bunch of wires connecting things together.  Except they [acid-etch copper onto a plastic PCB board](https://www.6pcba.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Copper-PCB.jpg) for neatness, then they paint that (green usually) to insulate the copper with the paint. So microchips are [the same principle](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Knd-U-avG0c/maxresdefault.jpg) except extremely miniaturized.  You still have wires connecting various components, but to get that small you need a process similar to (film) photography to actually "etch" the stuff onto the board. So with photography film, the film has a chemical that darkens if its exposed to light, and if you expose it very briefly to an actual image with bright regions and dark regions, the chemical on the film only darkens to match the image, and that's how you get a photo. With [photolythography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography), the machines project the actual circuit [as designed in CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) onto the material, and the material has layers of either semiconductor (silicon) to form transistors resistors etc., or layers of metal to be applied or stripped away.  Multiple passes through the machines, layer after layer of either "electronics" or "wires" get added to the chip. Ultimately a microchip is similar to a very large [abacus](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61G38aKIAlL._AC_SL1000_.jpg), the state of the transistors and memory voltages inside the chip keep track of numbers.  When the chip operates, it changes those numbers, over and over again to achieve whatever the programming tells it to do.  Except instead of 10 x 10 it's working with 1920x1080 for example, that's how many pixels of color your computer screen may have, and the graphics processor just calculates a number for each pixel for how bright it should be. Here's a [how chips are made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KcZGwntgg) video.
There are lots of things that can cause a crash. It can be as simple as a programming error, where a value is expected but not set to as complex as cosmic radiation tripping a single bit of RAM. As to why the computer can't continue running the program, they can... if the program was written to handle the error that gets triggered.  Basically... `try { do a thing; } catch { if thing fails; }` The problem is that you have to write the software specifically to handle a known potential error, and in many cases the error is something that was unforeseen. In addition, checking for and catching all potential errors makes the program bigger and slower. You may be familiar with the message "windows encountered an unknown error" or similar. This is that happening. What's more, once an error has been thrown it is often the best practice to stop the program from continuing as doing so could corrupt data. The above is a vast simplification of a complex issue... but hope it at least makes sense, as my ramblings are oft failing to do.
someone had to program it in, it works by pretty much doing all the equations for motion and forces you probably studied at school in physics class for every single 3d object, and using vector arithmetic from linear algebra to know in what direction to move things when they collide
Raw video is massive, so videos are encoded to save space.  The 4k video was likely encoded at a higher bitrate to take advantage of the potential that 4k has. Compression works by removing details and finding patterns across multiple pixels so taking a high bitrate 4k video and resizing it to 1080p won't loose as much quality as you might expect. Interestingly the relationship between bitrate and resolution isn't super straightforward. A high resolution video can look either better or worse than a lower resolution video at the same bitrate.  Basically the larger resolutions have more potential to show detail, but if you don't include enough detail then having more pixels makes it easier to notice the poor quality Check here for a chart: https://teradek.com/blogs/articles/what-is-the-optimal-bitrate-for-your-resolution
It's a machine whose purpose can be changed.  A toaster will always be a toaster, a refrigerator will always be a refrigerator. These machines only serve a small set of predefined roles.  A computer is a machine that can be repurposed to do pretty much anything (1) provided it has the right hardware. While this may seem obvious to us today because computers are commonplace, no such machine existed until the middle of the 20th century. That act of changing what the machine does is called being "programmed." We even have computers that are programmed to work inside toasters and refrigerators!   (1) Beyond ELI5, but there's a mathematical definition of a computing device and a conjecture called the Turing-Church hypothesis that says anything worth computing can be done by it.
These guys are training you to fail it sounds like. I don't know 100% because this is just one post, but any teacher who has a problem answering a question more than once, or thoroughly making sure you understand the concept before moving on is a shit trainer. That's not how you teach people how to think, that's how you teach people how to regurgitate information. That being said, they basically just run an electric current through either a wire or a die, depending if it's a wire feed edm or a sinker edm. The electricity essentially vaporizes/breaks down the metal on a granular level making it extremely precise and smooth. The high voltage running through the electrode destroys the metal, this is why sinker dies are made from graphite as it is extremely conductive and resistant to temperatures and voltage, and why the wire feed edm machines use a continual feed of wire rather than just one strand of wire. If the wire would to be 1 short piece, you would just break the worse after cutting for a second. If you made the die out of something that couldn't handle the electricity it would break down as much or more than the part being made. Also it's important to remember, the wire or die NEVER actually touches the part. It gets close enough to arc and sort of melts the material in front of it. If you feed too fast and touch it can have some pretty serious negative effects, that would be my first guess with what you described. Somebody set the machine up wrong and ran the die too fast or at the wrong machine settings. I don't know if that possible, it would just be my first guess.
You don't need to teach a computer to understand what 0s and 1s mean you built it that way. The logic about the real basic stuff is built into the circuits. Some of the earliest proto-computers were "reprogrammed" by literally rewiring them. The trick with the programmable computer was to have all the logic for the basic operations be hardwired and have the computer read from some external input which of these operations to do in which order with what values.
Imagine you're an accountant, and you have to add up all the finances of your company. You could do it in notepad, by just typing out all the numbers, and then manually adding everything up, and then typing out the results manually, and then copying the numbers around where you need to use them in other calculations, and so on. You think, surely there's an easier way. There are so many people in this world who have to do this work, hasn't someone come up with a better way to do such commonly-done tasks? Then you learn about Microsoft Excel. Excel lets you type in the numbers, and you type in a formula (like "=SUM(A1:A20)") and then bam! Everything calculated for you! Programming computer graphics is similar. Say you have to program how the lights work in a game. Well, you could manually program how the lights bounce off of different objects, and how the camera sees them, and how reflections work, how different clothing textures look under different types of light, and so on. But surely someone has already done that, right? Someone has made a program where I can just draw a room and model a piece of armor and say "put the light here and make this metal armor reflective and shiny" and it does all the calculation and work for me, right? That's a graphics engine. It's a program to do general, pre-packaged graphics calculations for the programmers. You still have to program some of it, and you still need to provide the graphics, but it handles all the basic stuff for you, like shadows, lighting, coloring, and so on. Some are better than others (engine A draws more detailed shadows than engine B), some are faster, some are cheaper, etc., and they all work differently and produce different results. But you can still use the same engine and produce better graphics, just by providing more detailed models or graphics, or just learning how to use the same engine in a better way (sort of like learning fancier functions in Excel lets you make more advanced spreadsheets).
the GPU is run based on a "clock" speed which determines how often a single transistor is capable of switching in a time period(ie:a 100Mhz TRansistor can switch 100.000.000 times per sec ), and you expand that however many transistors comprise the core of the GPU.  this speed is a set value on commercial units because its the best compromise between speed, power drain and Heat generation(because as turns out passing current thru semi conductors heats them up) having the ability to overclock the chip  means you can tune said chip to run above the values it was specified for. if done conservative manner this is fine because modern CPUs/GPUs have a Healthy bit of tolerance due to the way they are manufactured/tested. the condition here is that  the higher you go the more power/heat dissipation you'll need+ because other components like memory rely on the "clock" to stay in synch going overboard will likely just lead to a system crash long before it can do any real damage.
The blockchain is what causes the environmental cost. The blockchain is a technique to keep a decentralized ledger, and it has a high cost in processing power to make it work. This is regardless of what you do on top of it. If you have a central controlling authority then a blockchain is superfluous and adds nothing to the system. > Obviously Bitcoin = bad, because people must always verify transactions. Bitcoin is bad from the power usage perspective because of the power requirements to mine new blocks, not because of transaction verification.
It's a big subject. At the most fundamental level, general-purpose computers work by executing a stored program. They fetch the next piece of the program, carry out whatever the instruction says, then fetch the next piece of the program and then carry out that instruction. Repeat forever. General purpose computers are built as specialized electronic hardware designed to carry out this operation over and over at the highest possible speed.  These computers are revolutionary in that they can carry out any number of different tasks depending on the details the instructions they are executing. So the same machine can be easily and quickly be repurposed to do all kinds of different things. The set of instructions being executed is commonly called the *program*, and is the product of an engineering discipline called *software engineering*.  In reality, software is represented as numerical information stored in a sequence of memory locations in the computer.  Early programs were actually written by humans as a sequence of numbers, but now better representations exist, which we call *programming languages*, which are themselves turned into numbers (by other programs called *assemblers*, *compilers*, and *interpreters*).  So the generation of numerical program information has become much more efficient in the last 40 or 50 years, and much more elaborate software has become practical and common. Hope this at least gets you started!
Assembly in 1949 was the first widely used language which has instructions which directly stand for machine code which could be interpreted from the instructions. The first compiled language, autocode, came three years later, which used a compiler to convert instructions to machine code.  There were several iterations in between. For further back see Ada Lovelace
"Kernel" is an overloaded term that is also subject to some arbitrary classification. But, generally, the difference nowadays has to do with a concept called *privilege separation*. The kernel is the part of the operating system that has direct access to the hardware - something that normal apps (or many other parts of the operating system, including core system services) generally aren't allowed to do. It's separated from the rest of the system by a strict boundary - any time a program needs to do something that requires hardware access (like writing a file to storage), it needs to talk to the kernel, and the kernel is what does the actual write. Generally, to build a safe system, you want to avoid giving things access to power they don't need. So modern operating systems generally tend to move things *out* of the kernel and into what's called *user space*. (Though it's important not to confuse this with the actual *user* of the device. "User space" in kernel terminology can include critical system services that run with administrator privileges)
Frameworks and libraries both refer to code that is written by someone to assist in writing a program. A framework is a program that someone else wrote, that you modify. You plug your code into the framework, and it customizes the program to fulfill your task. A library is some code that someone wrote that you plug into your program. In this case, you write the program, and you plug in someone (else)’s code to save time or improve legibility. To put it in a general way, if you’re familiar with Java or a similar language: If they wrote the `main` method, it’s a framework. If you wrote the `main` method, it’s a library.
It was done by hand with pen and paper. You could do that today by creating a program in assembly code and converting it to machine code, it would not be fun or fast but doable. The is the question how the machincode get to the computer Some early computer-like ENIAC use physical switches and wire plugboards [you can see it in this image.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Two_women_operating_ENIAC.gif) So software was not something you loaded but required you physically manipulation by humans &#x200B; Others used punch cards/punch tapes to store programs and data.  Both predate computers by decades/centuries so computer designers reused existing equipment when the first computer in the 1940s was designed.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape has been used to control looms as early as 1725 and on the large scale since 1801 and for automatic communication from 1846 for telegrams with morse code and similar systems.   Teleprinter networks for automatic text transmission were built between WWI and WWII with electromechanical systems. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card is fundamentally almost the same as punch tape. It had to be used for data processing with mechanical and electromechanical before computers existed. The US census in 1890 was done with punch cards and tabulators.   The IBM punchcards with 80 columns and 10 rows that dominated the market were introduced in 1928 and were commonly used with a computer into the 1970s There existed equipment to automatically make punch cards/tape before the computer and you could even make them by hand with a hole punch. A guide to putting the holes in the correct location is an advantage but technically not required.
Hi :-) You usually print the parts and assemble them. Many things require some other bits like bolts, nuts, or are simply cheaper (or more rigid) to be combined with off-the-shelf parts. And metal bearings for example have less friction than printing moving parts.  But you *can* print moving parts in one go. E.g. pull-back cars. As long as the clearance is large enough and the used material is rigid enough. Even some airline companies "print" complete engine parts (metal powder + laser sintering) that would traditionally would require welding or bolting multiple parts together.  Printing 3D printers is also a thing, but you usually are limited to the frame parts. Projects like the Snappy can print up to 80% or so of their own parts. But it's not always the most economic or functional way. :-)
An older computer is less powerful than devices sold today. Applications and websites grow in size all the time, and may not run well on older machines. An old installation of software may suffer from disk fragmentation (on true magnetic disks) and increased size of the registry or other configuration files. This gets worse if software gets installed and uninstalled often, and the temporary files are not separated on their own partition. A noticeable speedup can be gained by reinstalling then operating system, and adding only required applications and drivers with minimal features. As long as the computer works without errors, its actual performance will not degrade. But we usually demand more of it. It is possible for parts to be damaged by heat if the computer is really dirty, but the effects would then be quite prominent, such as the machine shutting down, fans spinning extremely fast, or the speed throttling down a few times.
Hard drives have a spinning metal disk and they "write" data in circles just like a CD. But they "write" by magnetizing a spot with a North or South pole. Reading data back, they just read whether it's North or South on those spots to get the data back. On a CD, the laser reflects off the shiny layer. If the laser bounes back, its like reading a North pole, or scatters off to the side would be a South pole. That's how it can read the data back. Writable CD's have a layer of ink to block the laser. It burns through a spot to make a data bit, or ignores a spot to make a zero. Rewritable CD's will "warp" the reflective metal disc to make a bit, or leave it alone to make a zero.  Something like that.
That's why you have to learn assembler programming. It's closest to what the hardware actually does. So a program ("software") in assembler basically looks like this: Move the content of this memory to that memory Take this value and add the value in the other memory Compare this value to that, if it's the same, jump to some other instruction &#x200B; So the hardware is "hardcoded" with these "move", "add", "compare" etc. instructions, that's what never changes. How you then combine these low level instructions to actually create consumer software is the real tricky part. We basically invented operating systems to make it easier to talk to various hardware components, then invented higher programming languages to make more advanced concepts available (like object persistence, inheritance, constructors, multi-dimensional arrays, multi-threading etc.), but in the end the CPU still just executes a long list of "move this, add that, compare this" instructions.
It's simple. Rendering can be done in many different ways, focusing either on quality (like in maya/blender), or on speed (like in games). These two objectives may require completely different algorithms (which just means different ways to proceed), and data. So much different, that the two tasks have different names: **Real-time rendering**: must be done in fraction of a second. Sure, image quality should be as good as time allows, but the imporatant thing is that it is kept fast. Used by (for example) games. **Off-line rendering**: must look very good. Sure, processing time should be as short as the task allows, but the important thing is that the final quality is good. Used by (for example) CGI movies -- such as Pixar's movies etc.
Remember when you were a kid and your dad asked you for a 7/16 socket, then a flat head screwdriver, and a bolt while he was working on the car?  You were the RAM and he was the CPU.
Raspberry Pi is a type of very minimal computers made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. They are basically just tiny circuit boards with a little CPU, som RAM and other essential components on it, as well as some sockets to plug in USB or network cables. They don't have a lot of processing power, but they are small and inexpensive, which makes them ideal if you need a computer to run some simple program and nothing else, or need it to control something that you can't attach a full-sized computer to.
Internal port: Ports on machines inside a network. The ports that the service is actually running on. Very often the same as the external port, but doesn't have to be. External port: the port that people *outside* of your network use to connect to you. This essentially can be treated as the port open on the router, not the server. For instance: imagine you have a server with internal IP 127.9.8.7, who is running a server on port 1234. Inside the network you can connect to it using 127.9.8.7:1234 and everything is fine. Now imagine your router has the IP address 20.20.20.20. This is the IP that *other computers* out there in the world use to connect to your network. Now, your network might contain dozens of computers, and all of them may be running servers. How does the router know to route the message to your specific machine? Well, that's where the external port comes in. You can tell your router "Any time someone connects to 20.20.20.20:9999, send it to 127.9.8.7:1234" From there on if someone wants to connect to your server form outside the network they send a connection to 20.20.20.20:9999, and it gets redirected to 127.9.8.7:1234.  9999 is your external port, and 1234 your internal port.   Inbound and outbound kind of are self explanatory: it's the direction of traffic. Inbound traffic moves inwards, to your machine, and outbound outwards, away from your machine.  Source : Where is the request coming from? Destination: Where is the request going to?
The keyboard still has 1 or more drivers. They just are standard ones that the computer operating system already has. When you plug in a graphics card, it will work to a built in standard driver that has basic features. But you need a new driver as it was not part of the operating system when it was released to make it do all the fancy stuff. So if you have a keyboard with fancy RGB or macros , you might need an extra keyboard driver for the same reasons.
Depends on what you mean by "cleaning the hard drive"?
The information on a regular copy of the game is compiled code.  That is code that has been translated, optimized, and re-written into language that the computer can understand.  If you opened it up in a text editor it would be gibberish. The source code is written in a language that people can understand.  If you opened it up in a text editor it would be recognizable as letters and words.  It might still be gibberish to you if you don’t understand the programming language, but at least you could read parts of it. Some languages can be decompiled into source code.  For example, there are tools to extract Java source code from the compiled code.  It won’t match the original code word for word but it will be functionally the same thing. That’s universally how programming languages work; there’s a lot of other stuff that goes into game design with assets like 3D models and sound effects - maybe someone more skilled in those details can help out.  But the difference between machine-readable code and human readable code is a fundamental issue blocking that sort of reverse-engineering.
Both are ways for computers to encode text. ASCII is an old standard that use 1 byte per character. It is english centric and can't encode much more than the latin alphabet, which is problematic when dealing with non english content. UTF-8 is a newer standard that supports the full Unicode range (Unicode being a standard that aims to contain every possible character and symbol used by human languages, and more) while being retro-compatible with ASCII. This means that systems that were designed with ASCII in mind won't break when given UTF-8 and UTF-8 systems will process ASCII just fine, which is extremely important given the HUGE number of legacy ASCII only systems.   There exists a bunch of other text encoding (like UTF-16 or UCS-2), but UTF-8 has proven much easier to work with and more efficient in the general case, so most text should now be encoded using UTF-8 whenever possible (The web is > 95% UTF-8).
Data is always just a (binary) number. A long string of 1s and 0s To encrypt it you create a second, random looking number of the same length and then apply the XOR function on both. (Wich basically flips each bit of the original if the corresponding bit of the random number is 1) So to undo that you need the encrypted data and the same random number. Just apply XOR again to flip the correct bits back. XOR(A, B) = C -> XOR(C, B) = A This number isn't truly random. It's generated by an algorithm from a password (or Key). The same key always generates the same random number, but the random number can't be transformed back to the password.
An ISO is a collection of files. A live/bootable USB is a USB with a specific structure. Just like your computer, your USB will be formatted a certain way, have a boot sector, a file system in a particular structure, and any other partitions as needed.     Usually for linux there's 2 or more partitions. But the reason for flashing is that it's not just "copying" the files, but preparing the drive. It'll format the drive, write the boot sector/boot information, put the files in the appropriate structure/unzip as necessary, and confirm the integrity of everything.
Encryption as a whole isn’t made obsolete by increasing processing speed, but certain forms may be. Encryption generally relies on mathematical processes which are fast to do but very slow to reverse. If computers become fast enough then what was once impossibly slow might be feasible to brute force, but also we can increase the strength of the encryption to match, for example by increasing the size of the problem.
When you delete a file the operating system does not really remove the information related to that file. It just marks that location as being writable with new information
Properties are the result of those get and set keywords. The point to them is that they allow encapsulation which means that the programmer that writes the class can do a bunch of stuff that is hidden from the programmer that accesses the class. Consider this class fragment:  class Human{ private bool narcissistic; private bool compulsiveLiar; private int mentions; private string realname; private string fakename;  Public string Name{    get{            if(narcissistic) mentions++;             if(compulsiveLiar) return fakename;             return realname; }   Sorry for format on mobile.  A programmer that accesses the Name property only knows that they get a name but a whole bunch of other stuff goes on.
Drivers tell a gpu how to run a certain type of process efficiently. A newer gpu may not have the proper driver updates to run older processes efficiently.
It is indeed a bad idea but worse then the alternative. The capacitors are there to make sure the processor have enough power. The power consumption by a processor varies a lot. For each cycle it will flip millions of transistors which all require power all at once. And then entire processor units can be switched on and off all at once. It takes time for current to go through the wires from the power supply. So the processors need power available as close to them as possible. Even just putting the capacitors a few centimeters away might make the wires too long for the processor to be stable. It might actually run out of power for each cycle.
The game has many high res custom textures. To have big open battle royale map requires a ton of different things which all need their own textures.
It goes back to the IBM Personal Computer It had good market adoption and ended up with a sizable amount of third-party peripherals and accessories that were "IBM PC compatible" Macintosh computers were the main non-compatible computer on the market and so you ended up with PCs(IBM PC compatible hardware and accessories) and Macs(things compatible with Macintosh but not PCs)
Imagine you're at the head of a river where it splits into 5 streams. Downstream there are 5 waterwheels that will raise a flag if a certain level of water is in the river below it. You have the power, through a nifty damming set-up, to route water to any, all or none of these waterwheels. Soon your dam tech gets pretty sophisticated, and more importantly, it gets smaller! So you can have little dams at every stage in the stream, and there are channels of water between the dams that communicate: so you can have, say, a flag that raises if Stream 1 has water but Stream 2 doesn't; or only if Stream 1 and Stream 2 have water; or if either do. You'll eventually need more streams to make the most of the possibilities here - calculations! - but that's fine because the head dam is filling up way faster than you could ever let the water out. Eventually you might have millions of streams. Pretty soon you can have a grid of 640 x 480 waterwheels - a monitor - and a team of workers manning the head of the river - a keyboard - and if you've set your little damming project up just right, you've got a computer.
Short answer: it doesn't. Long answer: it doesn't and theory of relativity disallows not only matter but any form of information to travel faster than light.
It depends. Some games are built on top of frameworks which does have support for multiple operating systems already. So most of the work is already done and you only need to find the bugs which are specific to your game. Things like path names being parsed differently and such can take a bit of time to locate and fix. You might need to deploy things differently and include different libraries and such for it to work. This is why you might see a main release on Windows and then as developers get time to look at the bugs for other operating systems these will also get through QA and released. However some games are written with frameworks and libraries which are not available everywhere. It used to be that the major separator was DirectX but this is no longer the case. There are however other libraries that have poor support for other operating systems. And if you have written a lot of the game engine yourself there is a lot of different assumptions you might have done which is correct on Windows but not the other systems. Things such as how windows work, fullscreen support, how events are handled, where files are installed and so on. Even though the game itself technically should work on all operating systems it is all these small things which actually make up a large part of your code but have nothing to do with the game that needs to be completely rewritten.
What would that achieve? Distributing the important stuff over more folders, so deleting any of them breaks your PC doesn't sound like an improvement
Easy example is the metadata in a photo. The photo is the data and the metadata is the data about the photo. Location, time, size, resolution, exposure and iso, etc
Currently it is an artificial limit, to provide backwards compatibility. In current versions of windows you can enable "long paths" in your local policy to remove this limit.
Generally they don't have an elaborate board *unless* we're talking about the for-profit reasons. [Here's a teardown](http://wandel.ca/hp45_anatomy/) of a relatively old black HP ink cartridge. The most complex circuitry is the part that controls the ink nozzles. It turns out it's pretty complicated to control those! Any further circuit board would be related to things like trying to enforce an expiration date on the cartridge or identify which cartridge is plugged in if the printer/manufacturer cares. They don't *need* it.
The data stored in the RAM does get cleared when you reboot a computer, and oftentimes some or most of it gets cleared when you shut down the program that was using it (like a video game).  But you still need *some* minimum amount of *available* memory to run certain programs. Using video games as an example, 128 megabytes of RAM is not going to be enough to store and handle all the data required of a modern 2021 game. It's not even going to be enough to handle all the data required for the basic Operating System, let alone the Operating System *and* the game.
3 Factors 1) Bigger CPU = More Transistors = More Heat = Melted CPU.  CPUs already have issues dispersing heat at present state, making them bigger and slapping more heat into them seems a bit risky. 2) We're actually running up against the speed of light/speed of electrons!  Even though the speed of light is very very very fast, we're reaching the point in computing where if the chip is too big the signals cannot get from where they start to where they need to be in time 3) Finally, bigger CPU = more risk of flaws in the fabrication process.  Doubling the size of the chip increases it's area by 4x and that is a 4x increase in some flaw existing that makes the whole chip useless.
Sometimes, there is more included in the game files than is used in the game.  If, say, a new character was going to be added to the game, that character's art might be packed into the game to get ready for their release even when they're not actually visible in the game yet. "Data mining" is just digging through the game files and looking for interesting things like that.
Worst case scenario, you have to largely re-code everything. This was more common with older generations e.g N64, ps1 & pc were quite different. Best case scenario you're using an engine (e.g unity/unreal) that can directly compile the game to whatever platform you want. If it's an indie game that's not stretching the limits of the system, this may be a relatively easy job.  Usual scenario, you can keep a lot of the same stuff - but may need to tweak things to stay within the specific capabilities of each system. Certain bits of code may need rewriting to work around unique aspects of each system or for performance.  Nowadays, PC, PS4 and Xbox are quite similar in architecture so it's generally not a terrible job. However for each platform you (*should*) do lots of QA testing (quality assurance) - which is a lot of work so many platforms duplicate effort.
It wouldn't really add any security, as it's in effect just a longer password with non printable parts included. It would also raise the issue of making an error when typing in your password require completely restarting, this decreases security if there's a possibility of someone seeing what you type.
By maintaining an index of the data, in conjunction with a defined File System. The Operating System works in conjunction with the indexing and file system, so that when, for instance, the operator asks for File X, the file system tells the operating system where to look
Smaller transistors use less power and so they also get less hot. And using smaller transistors means they can squeeze more cores onto a CPU/GPU.
The reason that you have a dedicated GPU in a PC is because the cores of a GPU are different from the cores of a normal CPU. They are optimized for doing some specific kinds of calculations that need to be done many thousands of times per second to get your video output correct, whereas your CPU is made for general purpose computing, which means it needs to have everything available to it. Think of a GPU like a drag race car, designed for that short burst of speed. It isn't going to do very well on city streets, taking turns, hauling cargo, etc. It can certainly do its one job very very well, but isn't good for the general purpose. Now why they're separate in a PC is still another question. It comes down to two elements. First is consumer choice, being able to choose a separate CPU and GPU. The second is in design. Not every CPU maker wants to be a GPU maker, and not every GPU maker wants to be a CPU maker. They can each specialize in their own product. Now applications like a console or the Steam Deck have different requirements. They are going to ship with the same CPU and same GPU for everyone, but they are going to be more constrainted on space and cooling than a traditional PC. However, they don't have the same requirements for modularity. This means they can throw away the idea of keeping the CPU and GPU separate, and create one processor that has cores for both kinds in it. This lets them optimize the physical space on the board, as well as the cooling, etc.
An approximation of pi, accurate to a certain number of digits, is basically hard coded into the calculator. So when you press the pi button, it just loads up that stored value.
No. The frames are still being generated whether the screen is in or off. All that changes is the screen isn’t listening when it’s off. You’ll save some wattage by having the screen off, but playing locally will be… taxing. If you’re streaming to another device however, turn off the screen and do the environment a favour.
Healthcare gets really weird in the United States. When you look at the price of medications, it usually has very little to do with the actual cost of making the medication, and much more to do with a lot of other things. Let's make up some numbers and say drug A costs $1 to mass-produce a 30-day supply in a factory in India. Shipping and storage add costs, so the pharmacy pays $2. The pharmacy has to keep the lights on and pay its pharmacists and pharmacy techs, but they do a lot of volume and keep things efficient, so charging $10 for the prescription means they can turn a small profit. Now, let's say the pharmacy takes Insurance B. Last year, they told the insurance they needed $10 to break even, but the insurance is trying to keep costs down as well, so it said it would only pay 80% of that. The pharmacy is losing money, so this year it claims it needs $15. Insurance cuts their payment to 66%, but that's just enough for the pharmacy. Repeat this cycle until the pharmacy is claiming $100 and the insurance is paying $12. \[In reality this gets even weirder, because a pharmacy one block away may be charging ten times more or less. The contract is actually with something called a PBM, which is a sort of middleman that has been the target of many lawsuits.\] Now, a customer with no insurance shows up. The pharmacy has sworn in its contract with insurance that the true and appropriate price for drug A is $100, and cannot charge the customer less without getting in trouble. GoodRx has its own set of agreements with insurance/PBMs. It simply provides a contract-legal way for that patient to access the same kind of "discount" pricing that insurance B offers That's the incredible thing: GoodRx doesn't actually pay for this discount. GoodRx actually takes a cut from what the customer pays (and pharmacies are more or less willing to go along with this since it still means steering a customer towards them, not that they have much choice.) What it does is allow customers who aren't using insurance to access the "discount" that someone using insurance would get. It's a sweet gig that exists because the American healthcare market is seriously distorted. This same problem exists a lot in American healthcare. Hospitals charge an enormous fee, knowing that insurance will only pay a small fraction (which is closer to what the hospital actually needs to keep the lights on.) Uninsured patients must be charged that full enormous amount, because that's what the contract said. **TL;DR: GoodRx exploits a sort of contract loophole that allows people to access discount rates, and gets paid to do so without having to spend anything.**
reverse engineering is taking the cake and then trying to determine the recipe to create it. often done with software for example where the software itself would be the cake and the recipe is the source code. but obviously this is done with all matter of stuff.
Well the problem is that it messes with conductivity when heat gets too high. Semiconductors stat to work differently and and that is very much unavoidable.
1. Building and running chip fabs are EXPENSIVE. We're talking billions, even tens of billions, of dollars for one of the top of the line processes. Once a fab is built, it will generally only produce the process it was built with (think TSMC's 5nm or 7nm processes). Generally speaking the top of the line fabs are used for the newest CPUs/GPUs. Older processes are used for less critical or sensitive parts like car chips or chips in your TV. 2. Building these fabs take years, sometimes a decade. Process R&D and fab construction takes place in parallel. While TSMC's top of the line process was 7nm they were already most of the way to getting 5nm ready for prime time and already started R&D on their 3nm process. These 2 basically mean that our chip supply is pretty inelastic. It can't respond to big changes in demand. They're too expensive to leave idle and they take too long to build to respond to something like the pandemic. Companies are not willing to drop several billion dollars on a fab when the elevated demand will likely return to normal after a few years. Well before the fab can turn a profit. 3. The pandemic completely screwed with our typical demand and supply chains. For example, over the last year and a half so many more computers were sold plus launches of new consoles really strained the supply chain. Lower staffing levels at the fabs due to the pandemic didn't help. This increased demand basically maxed out the existing fabs. 4. Other shit happens. Taiwan for example had a drought. Chip fabrication needs a lot of water to work, this will cause problems. The power loss in Texas actually knocked out a bunch of fabs. This was literally a disaster because fabs are not designed to be shut down suddenly. It took months to fix the damage and get the fabs back in working order.
So a CPU is really a small machine that we can give instructions to. The instructions are really simple, like "put this number in memory at this place", "add this number to the number in memory at this place", or "follow the instructions at this place instead of the next instruction".  Programmers of the very first computers had to write programs using those instructions. We call this "assembly code" or "machine code".  A programming language compiler is a program itself! So the very first language compilers were written in assembly. Some languages were written using a process called "bootstrapping". That means the programmer wrote some of the most important parts in machine code, then used those parts to build a new compiler out of the parts of the language the compiler supported, then built another compiler with those parts, and so on. (Lots of compilers are still built this way.)
The hardware is not exactly same. First of all the price of having similiar hardware in much smaller size is pretty significant. Secondly your pc should be way stronger than your phone. It can use multiple giant screens and run high end games with good fps.
Sim cards aren't....blank or filled.  They're made with a serial number already burned into memory. All the carrier company is doing is associating their billing account and phone number routing with the new sim card's serial number.    It could be a sim that you've used or a never been used one. Yea you'd want it on same network.  Cause TMobile isn't gonna assign you onto Verizon's network.
Sometimes either the game is poorly adapted to the console (i.e. bad remasters) or just badly coded/optimized. Every console/PC has limitations in its soecs and sometimes developers either want to do too much, either they don't optimize their code well. Sometimes both, which make for even worse performance.  Some platforms were notably harder to code on, which explains also why most games run badly on them
Speed reading is just that: reading quickly. The idea behind is it that when most people read, we do so with subvocalizations that are slow. That's the voice in your head when reading something. Speed reading is when that voice is suppressed since it doesn't aid in comprehension. There is a website where you can paste in a block of text and set a words per minute rate and it will flash the text at you that fast. I use it for lengthy articles that I want to read.
Why? SLI used to be a thing but not much anymore, check LTT video on 2x3090
The CPU is almost never the bottleneck. That's usually your GPU. Rendering the graphics is orders of magnitude more intensive than running game code, especially for really big, flashy modern games on high graphical settings. The only big exception to this rule I can think of is Minecraft Java Edition, which is the complete opposite, pushing Java (a terrible language to write big video games in) to the absolute limits of its CPU performace while being child's play for the most basic of graphics cards to render. Still, maybe it is your CPU. Why such low utilization? The thing is, almost every CPU out there today is not just one CPU. It's usually two, four, or even eight mini-CPUs (called "cores") all living on the same chip. Each core basically behaves like its own standalone CPU. Actually, it's more than that--each core in a common CPU these days can be further split into two "virtual" cores. Essentially each core can do the workload of two. So if you have a 4-core CPU (which you likely do), then for all serves and purposes your computer appears to have eight cores. Having multiple cores means each core can be running its own task at the same time as each other, allowing your computer to multitask. Each core can handle one job at any given time. Most video games are what we call "single-threaded". That means the bulk of the main code associated with the game all must be run as a single job that can't be split up for multitasking. This one job will be assigned to one of your cores. If that core maxes out, that's only 1/8 of your max processing power. So while that one core may be completely overwhelmed with work, your total CPU usage will only show about 13%. So that's possibly why you see low CPU utilization.
It means instead of running a program on your computer, you run it on a portion of someone else’s computer or computers, usually a huge data center (many many many computers housed together).  The “cloud” (the data center management software) figures out where to actually run it and reports the results back to you. You can ignore the mundane details of actually managing hardware and just rent/lease whenever computer capacity you need from a cloud provider. Data flows back and forth between you and the cloud over the internet (usually).
It can be a catchall term for applied knowledge along with the materials and methods employing human knowledge and discovery. What it "means" depends on the area and time period. Most people today might not consider the plough technology but, some time in history, it was.
It's related to pseudo random number generation. You start with a "seed". A value that your generator uses as a starting point, and every step it makes a new random looking number that is defined by the previous number and an algorithm that jumbles it until it looks like it's completely unrelated. And then you start creating world features based on that. Simplified examples: If the number at coordinates X,Y is bigger than z then make a mountain. On the mountain create a tree whenever your random number ends in a 13. And then you tinker around with the rules of how that numbers translate to a world until it looks good.
All of these can have very wide ranging or generic definitions, however: Database: Some system or software that is designed to store, manage, allow access to, or work with any quantity of data in a (usually) organized, structured, and efficient manner. Databases can do all sorts of fun things like enforce a specific standard, do validation on data as it comes in or goes out, can link together multiple pieces of data in to a hiearchy, and other useful stuff to make sure your data isn't just the equivalent of that one flash drive you have with hundreds of nested folders named "stuff" and "important things". Data Warehouse: A system or suite of systems that can perform en-mass business analysis on a large amount of data. A data warehouse will pull from a wide range of sources and historic data to perform statistical analysis, use an AI to predict trends, classify the data, or otherwise perform high level analysis on it, put it up in to useful graphs and reports, and send it off to the person or persons who would find it useful.  Data Lake: So, Databases are cool and all, but what if your data isn't structured and doesn't fit all the required standards you need? Well, than you may need a data lake. A data lake is essentially a business-scale dropbox. All data, structured or not, can be dumped as-is to the lake for storage. The business in question can analyze it or give the data some structure later if they want.  Data Mart : A subset of a data warehouse focused on a very specific department, line of business, or subset of users. It allows those users to easily fetch and analyze data directly relevant to their needs and operation instead of having to shift trough or care about the rest of the data the data warehouse operates on.
The first programs were basically made in hardware. Connect wires in a way they solve your task. The first actually programmable computers read the program from punchcards. You could write them by hand.
I can't speak to WoW specifically but this is common to most large software projects. It goes to following 'good coding practices'. You do things in a logical, sensible, well-established way to make sure other people who read your code understand what you did. This is one of the key things students who are learning to code are taught. You are not just writing code for yourself but for everyone else who might ever read your code.  It's very likely there are pieces of code leftover from the very first version of WoW released in 2004 but of course huge parts of it would have changed as well to reflect new graphics capabilities etc. Again this is not uncommon. I remember reading that Windows 10 even has some code inherited from much earlier versions of Windows such as NT. Of course, I don't think MS has confirmed it but I wouldn't be surprised.
Some help train reflexes or coordination, or teach some skills. Some are just fun. > are they just a waste of time? Nothing you enjoy doing is a waste of time, don't let jackasses shame you for doing what you want in your free time. Chess or golf are hardly "useful" either and you don't see people heckling others for playing those.
It is and has been done.  Most intel consumer CPU has a built-in GPU. Just look at for example [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Intel\_Core\_i5\_processors#Cypress\_Cove\_microarchitecture\_(11th\_generation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_processors#Cypress_Cove_microarchitecture_(11th_generation))  where the 11th generation CPUs have UHD Graphics 730	 or UHD Graphics 750 GPUs. AMD calls their part with graphics for APUs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD\_Accelerated\_Processing\_Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Accelerated_Processing_Unit) Zen 2 has Radeon RX Vega GPU based Graphics.  AMD has faster-integrated GPUs than intel.   &#x200B; The built-in GPUs are slower than stand-along GPUs for a couple of reasons. The cooling is shared between the CPU and GPU listed of separated. so you have less available power and that result in lower total performance. The memory a built-in GPU used is shared with the CPU so a smaller total capacity than two separate systems. The memory is optimized for how CPUs use is not how a GPU use is so how fast it can provide data to the GPU is lower than if it was standalone even if the CPU does not use any of it. The cost of an integrated GPU in the CPU is lower than a stand-alone GPU but it is a tradeoff for performance.  The result is in modern games with advanced graphics the built-in GPUs tend to be too slow. The works fine if you play a bit older game that was designed at a time the external GPUs had the same performance as the internal ones today.  A 386 and a 387 combined is not a 486. The floating-point part was integrated into the 486 but there were lots of other changes The floating-point unit was initially external not because of power limited but because of the limited amount of transistor you could have in a single chip with reasonable cost. When it was possible it was integrated into the 486. The 487SX that was marketed as a co prosecco to the 486SX was in fact a complete 486DX with integrated floating-point calculation. The original 486SX was disabled and all was done by the 487SX You can make external floating-point units faster than integrated, that is in principle what a GPU is. The manufacturer makes a card for computation usage without any graphics output
We have done this. The roundworm C. elegans is one of the simplest animals with a nervous system, having exactly 302 neurons, and has been extensively studied, with every single connection between each neuron mapped. Scientists have simulated its brain for decades. Other animal brains have been simulated since, including animals as large as cats, rats, and mice. Simulating a brain is way more complicated than just comparing neurons to transistor counts. What makes a brain work is the way the neurons are connected. Even a small mouse brain has something like 10^11 connections between neurons. We don't have every connection mapped out, because it's very difficult to record where the connections are without cutting the brain into a million pieces and looking at them under a microscope to record every individual connection. The simulations of mice brains have predictions of what's connected to what, but we don't know if that's a good enough assumption. Even when simulating a worm, where we actually have mapped out every single connection between every single neuron, we still don't know how exactly those connections work. If neurons A and B are connected to neuron C, when does neuron C fire? Maybe it fires 10% of the time when neuron A fires, and 40% of the time when neuron B fire, and 80% of the time when both A and B fire, but these percentages get reduced if C has fired recently, except when B has also fired multiple times recently, etc. We don't know the details, and definitely not for every single connection. So our model is way simpler than the actual brain, even if it has the same number of neurons simulated.
Install is a transfer of data from a to b  Uninstall is just saying to the drive ledger that the place is available and nothing is on It. The data is not deleted technically. Just next time something can write on it . That’s also why recovery tool works usually!
Emulation and virtualization are very similar, mainly differing in the breadth of the implementation. Emulation mimics the hardware a game was created for.  The game is loaded by the emulator in such a way that when the software attempts to interact with the hardware, it is actually interacting with the emulator. Virtualization essentially does the same thing, but to a greater extent.  It further emulates the boot environment and other elements of a general purpose PC.  In this way, it is the operating system that is loaded and hardware calls remapped, similar to the game.  Once the OS has booted, the software running on that virtualized OS is able to run normally.  Custom hardware drivers are also typically used to allow software to believe it is making lower level hardware calls, like video drivers.  There are often also other drivers which do things like map host OS drives to the virtual OS, channel networking through the host OS, and allow the mouse pointer to be released from the virtual OS back to the host when it reaches the edge of the virtual OS window, when not running full screen.  So similar, but more extensive and more general. Compatibility layers seek to allow one OS to run software created for another by implementing the features the foreign software expects to be available.  This must be done by careful study of the feature and re-implementing it based on what is externally observable.  An API named X accepts parameters Y and Z and outputs A.  This avoids violating intellectual property laws since the work is new and unique, and does not use the original software in any way.  The main reason for compatibility layers is it uses less resources of the host OS, and has higher performance potential.  The downside is it tends to be a bit more buggy and not all software is supported.  Compatibility is created gradually, and it's a challenging race that is seldom finished.
Where  most CDs and DVDs save data by making mini pits in the discs, a hard drive has multiple read and high capacity discs stacked for capacity and read speed, that get set to 0 or 1 (north or south of the disc) magnetically. Then, the little read head on the arms have a tip that can swap the bit to a 0 or 1, allowing it to be reused instead of removing material. This is why you might have heard back in the day of people wiping their data accidentally (or on purpose) by having their drives get too close to powerful magnets. So how about rewritable discs? They're made of a special material that when heated, changes to either a crystalline or amorphous state. The state can be changed as necessary with of a disc reader laser. The two states reflect light different so it works just like a pit, if it reflects light it the proper way it's the set bit value of 0 or 1
In theory there isn't really a difference. C: is where traditionally your Windows OS lives.  D: might be another physical drive or it might be a different partition of the same drive. Often in computers with two different physical drives you might encounter a small fast drive where you put the windows on and  larger slower drive  where you put your data on. There is however no rule that D: must be slower than C: and with SolidStateDrives becoming bigger and bigger and more and more the norm that isn't really a thing as much anymore. Sometimes it might sense to carve up one physical drive into several partitions for some reason or another even if the partitions will be equally fast. If you are really unlucky and your application was made by morons you might run into trouble installing it anywhere other than the default programs folder on C:, but if they did what they were supposed to there should be no issue installing a program anywhere where there is enough room.
Good communication involves the fleshing out of arguments and ideas. It has everything to do with English literature. Ask the teacher or some class mates for better help
on hard disks, they're literally magnetic disks being written to. when there's not enough space to write anymore (or, that is, space that hasn't been literally overwritten to make "empty"), it's "full". on "disks" like SSDs, that comes down to the tiny logic chips and the like on it that dictate space. everything is interpreted as a 1 or a 0 -- on or off -- by the computer. the computer looks on the disc, and if it sees a 1, then there's data there.
Each improvement is the end result of a lot of research and development. And it isn't in any singular area. Modern semiconductors use cutting edge technology in material sciences, chemistry, optics, simulation, testing, computer aided design, equipment manufacturing, manufacturing process control etc. These require thousands of independent specialists in different fields. On top of the billions spent on basic R&D which mature at different times, there are billions involved in product development. Then there are tens of billions of investment required in capital equipment in many different companies.  What you see as a "next generation" chip involves many many different companies. It isn't as simple as saying "just skip a few generations" - without the prior knowledge, there is no roadmap to the next step.  In a sense, you're saying to travel from point A to B, why bother with the entire journey - skip the A part and just start in B and you're at the destination. This, naturally, makes no sense.
So "bricked" when used with the Fallout 76 stuff is a bit of a misnomer. "bricking" electronics means damaging an internal component or software in such a way that you can NEVER recover from it.  Wiping core system ROMS, heating system beyond normal and destroying components, wiping BIOS are all forms of "bricking" ( you computer is as good as a "brick" now, doesn't and won't do anything) The fallout 76 game was terribly optimized and was overheating people poorly built, or poorly cooled systems. To be fair to Fallout, if their system was that poorly designed, a failure was inevitable. People also reported it breaking their OS and windows would not boot anymore, but that is not "bricking" in the traditional sense. What you heard from the media was hype over a hated game. Games very very very rarely cause these types of issues, mainly because they don't have the ability to cause said "bricking"
Physical layer: how to manipulate electric current (or whatever) to send anything meaningful through the wire. Data link layer: how to send something meaningful to one of the few nearby devices in the same network segment (connected with a single wire or a switch). Network layer: how to send something meaningful through a larger network (advanced routing). Transport layer: how to isolate the back-and-forth exchange into a connection, possibly with reliability guarantees (if one of the packets gets lost, it's sent again etc). Session level: how to not just exchange data but do something complex with that connection, like authentication. Presentation layer: how to deal with complex data we exchanged, i.e. how to decode the .jpg image from the received data or turn letter codes to text. Application level: how to build an entire complex product like a website.
Remember high school physics? No? Me neither. Think of all the physics needed for a modern 3D game. How far does a projectile fly? How do you know when it collides with other objects? How would you model moving water?  A game engine provides most of this modeling for you, allowing you to focus on the game's content and mechanics, artwork, music, etc. You'll still need math, but it solves most of the common problems for you.
"Grow so fast" means that the difficulty increases insanely fast relative to the problem being presented. Here are some examples on the sliding scale starting with the easiest, and how changes the problem size make processing take longer: Given a list of numbers, which one is biggest? If you double the size of the list, a computer takes about twice as long to find the answer. Given a list of numbers, sort them in numerical order. Doubling the quantity of numbers means it takes *more than* twice as long. In some cases doubling the length of the list quadruples the time required, give or take. Sorting is a bit inconsistent since there are many methods with their own advantages and disadvantages in certain situations. Given a list of cities and a complete table of travel time/cost between them, how cheaply can you visit every city exactly once and return to your starting point? Adding 1 more city to the list will double the amount of time the program needs to figure out the correct answer. As things get worse, adding 1 bit to the problem makes the time required get absolutely absurd. "Infinite" processing power doesn't exist, and there are problems that exist today where even if the entire earth were made into top end CPUs working on the problem all together, the human race won't survive to see the solution. At this kind of scale it seems silly to even try solving them. Instead, the focus is more on, "how can we change the problem to make solving it easier?" Or lately, how quantum computers which follow entirely different sets of rules could make it possible.  ... On the other hand, there are problems that just plain can't be solved. At least not consistently. The most well known one is the halting problem: you have a program and if you were to run it, would the program complete or would it run forever never finishing? Taking 100 trillion years to finish still means "it will finish". There is no program that could analyse a program and make that determination consistently and reliably itself, no matter how incredibly powerful a computer you threw at it. So we say this is "uncomputable" because it is literally impossible.
That's a very interesting question.  A complete system needs many different silicon chips. A typical PC has a CPU chip, a GPU chip, lots of DRAM chips on the memory modules, and probably even more chips to make up the SSD.  The total area of all of those chips is enormous. Larger than what can be manufactured on one piece of silicon at this time. Basically, we can make chips that are about 800mm^2. A top of the line GPU would be about 650mm^2 which doesn't leave a lot of room for all the other stuff. That's where packaging advances come into it. We can't make one giant chip but we can combine smaller ones together in one large package or module. A Ryzen CPU is a good example of that. It has a number of CPU chips and also an I/O chip, all in one package. The CPU chips need to be fast so they are made an advanced process (i.e expensive) but the I/O chip doesn't need to be so fast so it can be made using an older, less sophisticated, and cheaper process. There are various ways to combine chips like that. You can place them side by side on another piece of silicon that has basically nanoscale wiring to connect things together (which is how Ryzens do it), or you can stack them on top of each other (which is a much more expensive and advanced option). So to answer the question, I'd say the cost of combining all the chips in one package is the major hurdle. It's a cutting edge technology and not many manufacturers can do it.
A modern video game is collaborative art, just like a movie; and shares with movies the types of artists required to produce it. A writer or team of writers come up with an argument and a story line. A sketch artist will draw some storyboards based on that. A producer or someone like that makes decisions to refine the story line, and there are a few iterations of that. Once the story line is decided, other artists come into play. Someone designs the scenery, someone designs the 3D objects and characters, someone designs the sounds. All of those things are then produced using 2D and 3D drawing software, and so on. Music is composed, played, recorded. Actors play parts to be captured by motion capture devices and turned into movement for the 3D characters and objects. All of this happens under the supervision of an art director. Then it all needs to be edited together.  All modern video games are computer programs. Based on the story line, developers create programs that take input from devices like game controllers, keyboards, mice, and interpret them to make things move and happen in the video game. It could be as simple as changing the color of something, or as complex as applying aerodynamics to decide how some object will move through air. Once the program has decided on what the outcome should be, what should move where and how, it triggers those events to be displayed to the player on a screen.
It uses a processor with a unique, custom architecture that requires traditional components of a considerably higher speed to emulate. Basically, because it's complex and not like current PCs, its not as easy as it is with other systems.  If PCs were built on the PS3's architecture instead of their current ones, it wouldn't take near the power or complexity of code.
Async and multithreading are different concepts.  Imagine you own a restaurant. Every employee you hire is a separate thread, so when you have multiple people working at the restaurant at the same time, you're doing multithreading. Now let's say your head chef says he needs some groceries delivered. So he makes a call to a delivery service, places his order, and tells them to ring the back doorbell when the order arrives. The head chef can continue doing his job while some other company/service is handling the grocery delivery. All the head chef has to do is be notified when the groceries arrive. That is async. The big difference is that with async, you're handing some additional job over to some other component OUTSIDE of your code, while with multithreading, you're handing some additional job to another thread managed by your code.  For example, you might send an async network request to a remote server to process. YOUR code isn't doing any of that work - it's being done by the remote server and your code is just receiving a notification when the response comes back. Or maybe the code passes off a length write or read request to the hard drive controller and just asks to be notified when the process completes.
Imagine a class as a blueprint for a human, the constructor is a set of instructions of how to create a human, and instances are different copies of actual humans.
The compilers do much of the work.The code that programmers has to be translated to instructions that the console's processors can execute, so a lot of it boils down to how it's translated/compiled. It's a lot easier nowadays since consoles are running AMD chips that are not much different from a PC. Even the best compilers require programmers to bear in mind some of the differences between various architectures. If consoles and PCs run very similar hardware though, there's fewer differences to account for. There's still some platform-specific tweaking that needs to be done, but far less than there were in previous generations when consoles were completely different from PCs.
Flip your credit card over for me. See that black stripe? That's a strip of magnetic particles, and your name, card number, security value, and a couple other things are written there. When you swipe your card, the card reader pulls that information off your card and sends it off for processing. A skimmer is basically another reader installed ahead of the reader you're intending to use, and that second reader is under someone else's control. It does the same thing as the intended reader, but someone else is taking the data and using it.
It’s not needed to buy and sell. It’s needed to mine crypto. It used to be CPUs instead but they can’t perform at the same speed as modern GPUs
Machine Learning is an umbrella term. It includes all kinds of machine learning models/algorithms. For example Linear regression, SVM and also Artificial Neural Networks. Deep learning is a term for some more “advanced” algorithms, including Deep Neural Networks which are Neural Networks with more than 3 layers. We think that our brains are (Deep) Neural Networks. Basically a Neural Network just apply weights to inputs and combines them in various ways (in neurons) to produce outputs. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Fig-y_Part_of_ML_as_subfield_of_AI_or_AI_as_subfield_of_ML.jpg
Possibly very slightly. Batteries don't like heat, any kind of intensive processing like gaming creates heat, and the battery would probably be slightly affected by that. Though personally I'd be far more concerned about something like leaving it in a car in the sun. That said: you bought a tool, use it. Unless you're really brutal on it, a battery should last a few years easily. Batteries degrade no matter what. And if by the time the battery becomes useless  you still find the laptop useful, you can buy a replacement for $30-$60 usually.
Is Apples silicon particularly ahead of the competition?
That is ... a lot. Kinda like asking "how does a car get built?" ... a lot of industries, tech, company suppliers and process that has evolved for decades. Same deal for computers. It's too much to bite off at once. Perhaps start with just the mouse? The wheel and clicking, and how the OS deals with that? Even then, USB and the message-based architecture of the modern User Interface is a lot.
Let's say you've scattered ten thousand items and bodies throughout the map. That's a lot, right? You'd have to play for *a long* time to pick up and drop that many items. So for each of those items, we need to record where it is (x, y, z coordinates, probably 8 bytes to each axis, so that's 24 bytes). We also need to record what the item is (probably an item ID (4 bytes) and maybe a quantity (4 bytes), let's say) So that's 32 bytes per item stack. Ten thousand items makes around 320 kilobytes. And that's without any clever optimizations or compression. This kind of data just doesn't take up that much space.
>Is this related to the length of the on board circuits and therefore the speed of light Yes, but that's not the only part. A CPU is made to perform a bunch of very basic operations very very very fast. A GPU, on the other hand, is a more specific piece of hardware made to perform more specific tasks, which are inherently more complex. So with each cycle, a CPU does one small job whereas the GPU does one big job. All inputs received by a CPU or a GPU travel on a path through the unit, depending on how they are being processed. This path is shorter for simpler tasks, longer for complex tasks. The length of the path makes the speed of light a consideration at such extreme switching speeds, as you've noted. But another consideration is how many transistors the signal passes through. Transistors have an inherent "switching time", which is the time it takes for them to respond to an input. It is extremely fast, but it builds up over longer paths as you pass through a whole bunch of them. So the total time it takes for an input signal to come out the other end is the total of its travel time between transistors plus the combined switching time of all the transistors it goes through. That time is longer in GPUs than it is in CPUs, because, again, GPUs do more complex jobs that require more work. Now, you can't run a processing unit at frequencies that cycle faster than how long it takes for an input signal to reach the output. Otherwise the operations start to produce incorrect results, you get errors, and in the worst case the system crashes because it ends up in a corrupted, inconsistent state. So you have to keep the frequency lower than how long it takes signals to sorta traverse the hardware. Also, power. GPUs already consume A LOT of power. Increasing the frequency increases power consumption and thereby heat generation, by a quite significant amount at that. CPU clock speeds haven't risen significantly for the past 10+ years, and that's because the beefier ones were already quite close to generating as much heat per unit surface area as some electric stoves on high heat. Added note: the switching time is determined by, among other things, temperature. The colder the silicone, the faster the transistors respond. That's one of the main reasons why CPUs can take higher overclocks with more powerful cooling. You cool it down further -> transistors latch faster -> the path gets faster -> the frequency ceiling rises -> CPU can clock higher before it starts drowning in errors and throws a kernel panic your way.
The important number isn't the number of bits, but the number of numbers you can make with those bits. With 32 bits, you can make around 4 billion numbers. If you were giving out a 32 bit ID to each person, you would not even have enough for each person in the world. 64 bits on the other hand gives you 16 billion billion numbers. If you were giving out a 64 bit ID to each person, you would have so many IDs that you could ID every second of every person's life.
So you break pictures and sound into chunks - spatial chunks for pictures and time chunks for sound. You then quantized that information - capture some discrete levels of color or sound and apply a number to it. That's digital media. So then you got a string of numbers that make up pictures or sound. You burn that information into a thin layer of aluminum. Every time your data switches from a 1 to a 0 or back again, you burn a little pit in the disc. On read, the disc reader uses it's spin speed and position of laser to start generating bits. Every time a pit comes, the laser is scattered, this is detected, and internally your string of numbers generate inverts.
Imagine a computer is a store with a basement and a shelf. You are the customer, and the pc’s job is to give you the desired product as fast as he can. If the product is on the shelf, he can give it to you directly. If it is in the basement, he needs to take a slow elevator to go get it. The shelf is RAM: A big shelf means that a lot of stuff is readily available and you get what you want quickly. The basement is the Hard Disk: everything you will want is stored there, but accessing it always takes a fixed amount of time (the elevator) The clerk is the CPU. If he is faster, he can get you stuff faster, both from the shelf and from the basement. If there is multiple (multi-core) you it is even faster, even if sometimes they get in each others way. You need both a decent CPU speed and a well-sized RAM to get a quick service.
First, the code is often wrong. Even the best projects like Linux or whatever have bugs (in fact, more complex programs tend to have more bugs, or at least are more exposed to bugs). When the code isn’t wrong, computers can glitch because their resources are finite (like a runner trying to sprint for 42 km, at some point he either stops or he *really* slows down) or because something happened with the hardware like temperature, static electricity damaging something, interference… people in IT sometimes joke about problems being due to cosmic rays, which is unusual, but it might happen. Any electronics is ultimately affected by the environment. I remember reading here on Reddit about an interesting case of smartphones crashing because the atmosphere had too much helium and iPhones (but not other phones) didn’t like that.
It is efficient. To have storage, there must be a way to address (ie locate) a storage location. Since nearly all circuits use binary logic, each location is determined by a binary "number" scheme. In this case every single additional address digit increases the number of locations by a factor of 2. 1 address bit addresses 2 locations ie location 0 and location 1 2 address bits address 4 locations ie location 00, 01, 10 and 11 and so on. Therefore for any size of the address bits, n, the most number of locations it can address is 2\^n which is a power of 2.  Also, the way digital circuits are designed, it is often simpler to fix certain address bits for storage and that makes it just the most efficient to use powers of 2 for storage. It doesn't HAVE to be, but it is typically used.
I'm not sure people have hit on what you mean by this. By your other comment, I believe you're talking about "min-maxing" in the Game Theory sense. In this sense you are *min*mimizing your *max*mimum losses. That is, for any strategy, based on elements of luck or other player's decisions there are a range of outcomes in terms of what your expected score can be. Different strategies have different ranges and we can think of different strategies in terms of their worst-case scenario (if everything goes wrong, how much would you lose if you chose that strategy) and their best-case scenario (if everything goes right, how much would you win if you chose this strategy). One way of choosing a strategy is min-max which says choose the strategy whose worst-case scenario hurts you the least.
> Is there some hard drive on the other side of the planet that stores my data? That's it in a nutshell. Instead of storing the file on your local computer, it stores it on a server somewhere else. These servers use very durable technologies that tend to be able to run more serious loads than your standard hard drive at home. They also often make backups of data onto standby devices so that if the main hard drive fails, they can just route you to the backup without losing your data.
The simplest way of storing information is in binary format. An individual piece of information (known as a bit) is either on or off. We can store this in a variety of ways: electrical voltages, magnetic charges, light and dark spots on a reflective platter, etc. So each bit can have one of two values. By convention, regardless of how that information is stored physically (see the above examples) we treat one of those ways as a 0 and one of those ways as a 1. So 1 bit represents 2 values. 2 bits would have 4 possible values (00, 01, 10, 11) 3 bits would have 8 possible values (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111) In general, *n* bits have 2*^(n)* possible values.
The problem isn't the power of the hardware, it's making the 3DS think like the N64/PS1. Each of these systems had different processes, and different instructions that needed to be sent. When emulating, your platform of choice isn't just receiving those instructions, it's translating them in real time, then attempting to play them back in their native language.  I like to put it this way. You have the capability to work as a translator (be the emulator), but you have to learn Spanish first (be coded to make your console think like a different console). You can't just take random guesses, otherwise you'll piss someone off (crash) or just sound like gibberish (not run, corrupt the software).
The CPU crunches all the regular CPU stuff, like managing the AI in a game, counting hits, etc.. When it comes to things the GPU is good at, like rendering, shading, etc., the CPU acts as a traffic director, sending the relevant data to the GPU to be processed. In the latest XBox (and coming to Windows) they found a way to send data directly to the GPU, mostly bypassing the CPU. This boosts the CPU speed because previously the CPU was doing a lot of work decompressing textures and sending them to the GPU. So now games that where the CPU is the performance bottleneck have much more CPU resources to play with.
Basically a larger transistor is going to take more energy to trigger a single on or off. The number of on/offs you can do means a more powerful computer (for the most part). So as you shrink the transistors it takes less and less energy to get the same amount of computational power.
Very One of the lithography machines might cost $250k and handle 10,000 wafers a month. But a processor might require 20 steps in that machine or a similar one so you only get 500/machine/month A place like ST or TI or TSMC with be making tens of millions of smaller micros per month, they're in everything from cars to microwaves to light switches The obvious solution is "buy more machines!" except the people who make the machines need like a year to get it all together and tested and they're going to be facing part shortages too This general difficulty gets compounded by other problems like the drought in Taiwan forcing TSMC to cut production ~20%
That's how far we've gone with storage technology. Memory cells can be made so tiny that trillions of them barely take up any space. Even in full-scale SSD drives memory chips themselves only take up a fraction of space, the rest being occupied by control / power distribution systems.
In sure, the computer has ended up in a situation where it is waiting for something to happen that will never happen. Either the computer is legitimately waiting (doing nothing while waiting for some event to happen) or it is stuck in some loop it can't break out of. Imagine, for example, you design a robot to walk down a hallway. You program it such that, if it sees something in its way, it moves to the other side of the hallway. What happens if you put two of these same robots facing each other? Well, they'll see they're in each other's way, then move to the other side. Where they'll be in each other's way, and move back to the first side. And so forth. This is called a "live lock." The computer program may have some sort of loop that is supposed to exist when a condition is met but, for whatever reason, that condition can't be met so it loops forever.
They are much faster. If you tried to load the old stuff you waited for as a kid on a modern computer, it’d be very fast.  As our computers became more powerful, we can do more in them so code and graphics have become more complex.  Some of the stuff we do regularly would have taken hundreds of years on old hardware.
The letter usually refer to the type of connector. In the past, USB connection can only be established with only one host (think of it like a controller/master of the connection). These hosts are usually built with a USB Type-A connector. That's why most computers have a USB Type-A receptacle. Peripheral devices like printers have Type-B receptacle because they are the followers of the host. Now USB-C aims to unify these ports but the standard was just established after several iterations of USB. USB-C can basically have higher speeds because it has more wires inside it.
New software requires better hardware. Since computer hardware is fixed (at least for laptops, phones, etc) as you run newer software (including updates to older software or OS updates) it's going to bog down performance.
There's no difference between an internal drive and an external drive. The rules that physical access can trump protections remain in effect. The main reason for permissions on a drive is to tell the difference between internally authorized and internally unauthorized people with respect to any given piece of data . So if I plug in a drive into my computer, by any means internal or external, and I let more than one person use it I may want to keep some of the elements from person a out of the hands of person b and vice versa . Now generalize the idea of person. Consider that the operating system itself is a person. Each user is a person. And in some ways each task a user performs as a person. That is the you that is browsing the internet is not the same as the you that is doing your taxes. You may want to keep your browser activities from touching your tax records. One of the problems you of course experiences that as you move your drive from computer to computer the person with the number 70 on my computer and the person with the number 70 on your computer, just pull 70 out of my behind as an example, may not line up. In fact if I am person 70 on my computer person 70 on yours might be you. So if something is restricted to be only accessed by person 70, obviously moving it from computer to computer has changed to that person is in a practical term.  One of the things we can do to complete a circle of protection is use some form of encryption, and especially if we can a tie that encryption to a physical computer we can really close the circle quite tightly.  The entire idea of the trusted platform module is that it gives a way for the owner of a computer tighten the circle down, potentially far enough that the entire computer has to move if you want the drive to move and still be meaningfully full of data . So the first layer of security at any computer system is to prevent accidents, the second layer is to prevent malicious activity, and the third layer is to prevent the system from being fully compromised and becoming unusable.  Note that this is no different than the problems one would encounter with a filing cabinet or a safe. Computers automate the real world, and if you let somebody take possession of your safe there's a good chance they're getting into it whether you want them to or not.  So one of the goals of security is to make it nominally more trouble to get to the contents than it is to look for an easier mark.  Competent security is really about layering, like the scales on a fish or the scales on an alligator. As long as you keep everything meshed the organism functions well, but if you disrupt the layers and connections you'll be able to stick a hook in it and do some real damage.
There are any number of different ways to make them. You could multiply by two by having a gear wheel with 20 teeth turning a wheel with 10 teeth.  Mesh the two together. Every time you turn the large gear one turn, it turns the other gear twice as many times. Any integer ratio could be multiplied this way.  Division could be performed by swapping input and output.  Binary computers operate on logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, etc.  An "AND" gate outputs a "high" signal when it receives two "high" inputs. If we declare a "high" to be a pushrod moving an inch, we can develop a set of linkages that will only operate if two inputs to the gate are actuated.  Mechanical computers are usually built for a specific purpose. The computer you're using to read this is a general purpose device, capable of performing a wide range of computational tasks. Mechanical computers were usually single-purpose devices.  [This is a purely mechanical computer](https://hackaday.com/2021/10/12/ibm-cheese-cutter-restoration/).  By inputting the density of a block of cheese, and the desired weight, this device mechanically calculates where to make the cut.  [Cash Registers used to be purely mechanical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OptA1cHzibE).  This one accepted one or more inputs (numbers and operators) then a crank was turned to perform the computation.
In the simplest sense, a server is just a computer. It doesn’t need a monitor, or even a conventional OS like Mac or Windows. Based off of its programming, it can store information, host a website, perform processes, whatever. The key is it’s connected to other computers through a network. Either local like in your house, or over the internet. But it’s just a computer. A box with memory and the ability to process information. It can look however you want it to as long as it’s got a cpu and memory. You can shut down a server the same way you can a computer. Kill the power, overheat it, pour water on it, hack it. With that - just about any computer you have can be made into server. While I haven’t done it, I’ve had friends do it with old laptops for fun. Apparently not very difficult at all.
the reproduction of another manufacturer's product following detailed examination of its construction or composition. You basically take a product or an item and want to make something similar without knowing how to make it. So you basically dissect and break apart the product and learn how it was put together.
So, this isn't JUST a USB cable. They actually manage to fit a very simple, very tiny computer into the space of the plug. This little computer basically has two USB ports. It'll send the data through each way, but it can modify it or record it.
If you're talking about starlink or iridium, it probably wants your location to calculate which satellites are in range, or to find out if you're using the service at a fixed location or on a vehicle(they'll probably charge more for the latter).  A normal router doesn't really have any use for GPS. Best use I can think of would be setting the local time, but I don't see why a router would need the local time, and it can get universal time from the internet. A normal router also probably doesn't have line of sight to pick up a GPS signal. "internet router" is probably not the right term to describe something that has GPS in it.  Edit: they also might want to know your location so they can find out which areas have good or poor service. Also,
A program is a series of one or more instructions, and zero or more pieces of data.   The instructions tell the computer what to do and they can use that data (or create more) as part of those instructions.   For a simple program you don't need to think much about how you organize those instructions or data.  However for more complex programs it can make it easier to create, test, and maintain the program by using models like object oriented programming. There are four key concepts in object oriented programming:   1. Abstraction 2. Encapsulation 3. Inheritance 4. Polymorphism Lets start with abstraction.  Abstraction basically means hiding information.  You already experience this in everyday life.  You might drive a car everyday, but you don't need to know the details about how the car works.  All you need to know are the basic interfaces of the car, the break, the accelerator, and the steering wheel.  If you understand how those work you can drive most cars even if you've never seen them before.  The same is true in object oriented programming.  You can create things called interfaces that define how some part of your code should behave, and as long as another person knows about that interface, they don't have to worry about the details.  For example I could create code that takes a list of numbers and puts them in order.  You could use that code, even if you didn't know how I made it work, even if you couldn't see the code itself, because I told you that the function sorts a list of numbers.  You put a random list in, an ordered list comes out.  This allows people to use others code without knowing the details.   Next is encapsulation.  This is where the object part comes in.  Lets say I want to create a drawing program.  I probably want to be able to, say, draw a circle in that program.  Maybe lots of circles.  It would be convenient if I have something that lets me save and use circles over and over.  One way to do this is to create some code that stores information common to circles, such as radius, origin point, color, etc.  I might also want to have some ways to get information about the circle, such as get its color.  And I might want to isssome commands to the circle, like draw itself on the screen, or change its color.  I can combine all those things, the data, and the instructions, into something called an object, in this case a circle object.  This is commonly called a class.  My circle class has places to store the information about the circle and functions (or methods) that perform actions on the circle.  Now whenever I want to do something with a circle I can use this same code over and over and over again.  And using abstraction I can share that circle code with other people and they can use it in their programs, even without knowing how my code works. Third is inheritance.  Sometimes two classes are very similar.  For example I already have a circle class, what about a square class.  A square shares some common behavior with the circle. A square also has color.  A square also needs to be able to draw itself.  But squares are also different.  They don't have a fixed radius.  How can I share the common information, but keep the different information separate?  I can use inheritance.  Just like in real life where someone inherits things from their parents or grandparents, objects can inherit too.  I can start by creating a shape class. The shape class will store the data and functions that are common to all my shapes, such as color, and draw.  Then, when I create my circle class, I can inherit from the shape class.  This means I don't have to write the code that stores the color value or gets it for you again, I already wrote it. I'm just telling the circle to use it.  Circle is a shape.  Square is a shape. But circle is not a square.  Inheritance helps you organize your code and avoid having to copy the same code in many places.  This is good for a few reasons.  First it makes it easier to think about how your program works.  Second, it means if you need to make a change in the code (to fix a bug or add a new feature), you only need to do it in one place, rather than many places, where you might forget.    Last is polymorphism.  This one is a little tricky.  Polymorphism allows you to change the behavior of functions in two key ways.  The first is called overloading.  Overloading means you can use the same command with different sets of information and each one will behave correctly.  An example might help with this.  Lets say I write a function called Combine.  My Combine function takes two pieces of data and puts them together.  But how it puts them together is different depending on the data.  Lets say I have three functions and they are all named Combine.  The first takes two numbers.  To combine those two numbers it adds them together.  If I give it 7 and 4 I get 11.  The second Combine takes two words.  To combine them it creates a longer word that is the first word followed by the second word.  If I give it cat and dog I get catdog.  The third Combine takes two colors.  To combine them it gives me a new color which is a mixture of the two.  If I give it blue and yellow it gives me green.   This can be useful because you can use the same function without needing to know before hand what the input information will be.    The second behavior change is called overwriting.  Lets say my shape class has a Draw function.  When I create my circle class, I want to tell it how to draw itself, so I create another Draw function.  Even though circle is a shape, it will use the new Draw method from circle, instead of the old Draw method from shape.  This lets you change certain behavior when your object needs to behave in a certain way.  There are many reasons this is useful in object oriented programming, but its probably more than needs to be included here. TL;DR version?  Object Oriented programming is just a style of writing programs to help you manage data and functions in a useful way based on the four key concepts of abstraction (hiding information and sharing only key details) , encapsulation (combing data and methods together to model objects), inheritance (using a hierarchy to enhance encapsulation), and polymorphism (adding situational flexibility to functions).
The short answer is a lot! The amount of equipment your web traffic will pass through depends on where your destination server is and how far away it is. A typical data path might be: Your Laptop > Home Router > Modem > ISP CMTS > multiple ISP Fiber switches > NSA tracking device > ISP border routers > Hand off to another ISPs routers > more fiber switches > Datacenter Routers > Datacenter switches > Remote companies Firewall > Remote Companies WAF > Load Balancers > Front End Servers > Firewall > Switching > Database Server
You have like 4 questions in here.  1. How does software exist on hardware? We found ways to store states of electrical current. Then we gave those states meanings. That's software. It can only be on hardware. We've abstracted the software written by people by several levels. The first is machine code, which is the abstract "on or off" of an electrical circuit. This is then abstracted into assembly code, which is vaguely human readable, then it's abstracted again into the programming language that the programmer writes. When the program is compiled, it goes back down the chain to do whatever the program wrote. 2. Why did it only come across in the last 80 years? Because before that, we didn't have any way to control electrical currents. This changed with the discovery that vacuum tubes can be used to do this. 3. Why were the first computers that size? Because of those vacuum tubes. They were big, and if your each piece of your memory bank is the size of a light bulb, then you won't get far with it being small. 4. How did they get smaller? We stopped using vacuum tubes. Now the tech we use to control electrical current is the transistor. We have gotten able to make transistors *very* small. This lets us put billions of them in a tiny processor chip.
The sound is converted into a digital, non compressed form that just has amplitude and time. Depending on the desired effect, the stream is mathematically manipulated. An amp just multiplies. A reverb just adds a the current value to future values, etc.  Some free packages allow you to add your own chains off effects from the math on up.
A lock has a bunch of pins in it cut to different lengths. The right key is matched to the pin lengths, such that when the key is inserted all of the pins line up. [Notice how in this picture, the tops of the red pins are all aligned.](https://www.locksonline.co.uk/community-old/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Pin_tumbler_with_key.jpg) This allows the cylinder in the center to turn, as there are no pins which run between it and the rest of the lock - all of the pins are retracted to just inside of the cylinder. Master keyed locks have multiple pins. One pin corresponds to the regular key, and the other to the master key. This allows the pin pair to be at two different heights when the cylinder turns. [Example.](https://www.holicongsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/master-key-diagram.jpg)
It all comes down to how the data's being stored. Some devices like tape and older disk drives use magnetic fields to store data. Those magnetic fields can weaken over time, and it's extremely hard to isolate them from random magnetic fields produced by other equipment or even the cosmos. The longer the data's been on the media, the more likely the field has been weakened so much that some data has been lost. Some devices use physical traits to store data, like CD-ROMs (not CD-Rs, I'll get to them.) But while they are made out of plastics that are meant to have a long life, they aren't eternal. Over time, the materials the discs are made of start to break down and can make it impossible to read some or all of the data. Some devices use chemical reactions to store data, like CD-R and CD-RW. Those chemical changes last a long time, but aren't permanent.  Some devices like flash storage use a combination of these techniques. But again, they can physically deteriorate or be disrupted by weird random cosmic events and that can lead to loss. So really the only way to preserve data in a permanent way is to periodically copy it onto new media and double-check the copy is accurate. The more copies you circulate, the more you guarantee you won't ever lose it. This is even true for analog data such as film. Time causes pretty much everything to break down in some way.
Nowadays, they’re written in regular languages and compiled just like any other program. By nature, an OS needs pretty low-level access to direct hardware commands so they tend to be written in lower level languages like C but that’s not strictly required.  Originally, they were coded by hand directly in machine code (the actual instructions that CPUs “understand”). For hopefully obvious reasons, this is horrible to actually do and that’s why writing higher level programming languages and compilers (translators from the programming language to machine code) was one of the first things we did.
In the back of the box, there is an electron gun. It fires a beam of electrons forwards towards the audience. This beam, if left to its own devices, would hit the screen near the center and do little of interest. This only works if there is no air to obstruct the beam, so the inside of the TV needs to be a vacuum. This already makes it pretty heavy, since it has to be able to withstand air pressure trying to crush it from all sides. This beam of electrons is guided by electromagnets, so it can be aimed different directions. This allows the beam to point anywhere on the screen. Because it can only be bent so much, the gun and magnets must be fairly far behind the screen. The TV has to be almost as deep as it is wide because of this. So you've got a big box with walls thick enough to contain a vacuum. That's going to be heavy. Those walls also can't be conductive, so that makes them even heavier since they must be made of weaker materials. So far, we have electrons being aimed at different parts of a glass screen. Not super useful yet. A phosphor is added to the glass; a material which glows upon being hit with these flying electrons. At this point, our electron beam can draw lines and curves on the screen. Next, the magnets scan the beam across the screen's pixels row by row. As it hits each pixel, it is made stronger or weaker by the electron gun itself, and this makes the pixels brighter or dimmer. An image is made by scanning across the *whole screen* and modulating the electron beam to produce the image. Color screens use colored phosphors and by various clever methods they illuminate only one at a time.
Imagine a piece of paper. You can write as many words on that paper as you want, but they can't overlap. Eventually you will run of space. A harddrive is similar. All data saved can be boiled down to a series of 1's and 0's. Hardrives only have so much memory to store all these numbers.
A pointer in programming stores the memory address of a block of data. It's useful when you have large amounts of data that you don't want to copy around your program, allowing you to instead just tell functions where to find the data you want to use.  C and C++ also allow you to index a pointer, offsetting the address by the size of the data type. This allows array notation which most programmers can easily read and understand as a series of the specified data type and helps organize and manage large amounts of data.
Anyone can come up with their own system at any time, as others have mentioned The standard is: First number: major revision. This would be increased if the whole software was rewritten almost from scratch, or the way it works for users was completely redone, that sort of thing Second number: minor revision. This would be for a feature update, adding something new or changing the way a subset of the software works Third number: patch. This would be for a bug fix or some other kind of tweak Fourth number (if exists): build. Usually not involved in public releases, it's basically the amount of compilations done while working on the current version. But if the public sees a fourth number, like if the last patch didn't work right and they had to rush out a fix, they might use the build number or replace it with just a .1 or .2 But again, almost every company does something different from this because it's just an ideal
Many games are limited in software to a given fps, like 30fps, regardless of the hardware.   This is to prevent variability in frame rate as you look at different scene complexity as you rotate the view, for instance.    However, new hardware can consistently reach 60 fps, such as when you upgrade from ps4 to ps5, there is no longer a need for the same low 30 hard software cap on fps.
Just like with common folk there are Conservative Mennonites and Liberal Mennonites Most of the rules are defined by the churches and communities but Mennonites recognize that not everyone in their community is going to follow the strictest interpretation of their rules.. The Schwartzentruber Amish are what we think of when you say Amish, VERY Conservative living off the land in old style houses with no Power. The Schwartzentruber are just one small sect of the Mennonites, but they are the poster children for the Amish. While more Liberal Amish/Mennonites have modern homes, are very religious, have the dress code, and tend to send their children to private Christian schools. They have normal everyday jobs and might carry cellphones but they also limit what kind of internet + TV they get etc. There's also some groups in the middle. Some of the schools for example have electricity, but it's solar powered and off the grid. There issue is less with technology and more about self sufficiency.
I think your anecdotal experience is masking the truth from you. No, everybody does not know about building PCs. Frankly it's not surprising that it's a popular hobby in some senses because it's very easy - the modular style makes it like the Ikea of electronics. I think the question is less about why so many people can do it, and more why so many don't - especially considering the popularity of pre-builts etc.
Go to your task manager and look at all the services that are running, Almost all of those services are started either when the system boots or when you log in. But an easier example is a program that starts up when you log in.  Lets use Steam as an example, Steam is a game launcher that comes with an integrated browser and many other features. When it starts up the operating system needs to read the executable to ram and execute it. When Steam starts to run it needs to discover what it is running on it does this by reading some files containing some variables, it then needs to load its many libraries and configurations from the disk so that it knows how to run properly. The thing that Steam is doing most here is loading, if you have a hard drive you may be able to hear it trying to read from the disk. but drives can only load one thing at a time and compared to a CPU they are quite slow so if you have multiple programs all trying to load something from the disk at the same time they will end up waiting in a queue for their files. Where you notice the slowness is when you the user try to open something manually, something like your web browser. The request to load your web browser ends up in the same queue on the drive, waiting for several other programs to get their files before it is loaded and then it may end up in a similar process to Steam as mentioned above making the loading time even slower. As for the first time in a day, you may just not notice it at other times. When your operating system loads it almost always loads into the same state as it did last time. there are some exceptions to this, in windows when the system shits down it will not complete some tasks on purpose to decrease loading times by skipping restarting things (what it does and how it does it is not ELI5).
Programming languages are changing in two dimensions over time: abstraction and specialization.  Computers, when you get right down to it, can't actually do much: just basic logic and arithmetic. Back in the day, "programming" was writing down a series of these basic instructions that would do something useful, like calculate a logarithm. But what's truly useful about that program is that anybody can copy and use it. Instead of writing your own instructions to calculate a logarithm, you just use the instructions someone else already came up with. Now nobody writes the code to calculate a logarithm themselves (outside of programming exercises). Modern computer languages just let you type something like "log(x)," and they do the rest of the work. Over time, we built up a bigger catalog of useful stuff computers can do and also had new ideas about how to best organize and implement all of it, so those ideas are periodically incorporated into new languages (or major updates to old ones). Also, using someone's off-the-shelf code is sometimes inefficient relative to writing something from scratch that is optimized to your particular application, but as computers get more powerful, there are fewer and fewer use cases where this is a concern. All of this means that modern programming languages are thus much more abstract (and also generally easier to use) than old languages like C or BASIC. The other dimension is specialization. Someone working with data and statistics is likely to use tools like SQL, R, and SAS. Someone working on a website is likely to use tools like HTML and PHP. These languages/software come with built-in tools that make them easier to use for certain tasks. You maybe *could* build a webpage with R or a database with HTML, but it would be incredibly difficult. Other languages, like Python and Ruby, are much more general, and with the right add-ons can approximate many specialized tools, but finding and learning those add-ons is often not worth it (relative to just using a specialized language) for someone whose job only involves one specialty.
First, minimize the processing that they have to do on their end. You move your mouse, this moves the character's arm. You press the button to fire. The gun fires a bullet. The bullet travels to another player. The game calculates whether it's a hit and applies the damage to the other character. The server doesn't care about any of the graphics side, so leave that to your computer to handle. All the server needs to know is the location of the players (three numbers) and the direction and speed of the projectile (two numbers). It then performs a rather simple mathematical calculation and sends the results back. Most of the resource intensive stuff are graphics which they just let you handle on your own? You can't handle those graphics? Sucks to be you. Second, on the server side, they have enough servers that are fast enough to handle all of the incoming information that they do actually receive, process it fast enough, and send it back to the player. Third, they don't actually care whether you get a response in a timely manner. The type of network connection they use is basically "fire and forget". Your computer sends the information to the servers, but it doesn't wait for a response. This is why network lag is perceived by players suddenly jumping around or freezing in place, because your client continues to process your actions, rendering the graphical part, but isn't receiving any info about anyone else to render theirs. For minor lag issues, you never notice and the game just continues to proceed as if nothing is wrong.
There are 400 GB memory cards. But for most solid state memory the reason for the power-of-2 sizes is that the underlying chips are produced like that to not be wasteful: each byte in a chip needs to be able to be addressed for reading and writing, to do that a chip has (very, very tiny) wires called address lines to select a storage cell. You need 10 address lines to address 1000 bytes: the 1000th byte would then be addressed as 1111100111 (=999 in decimal). As you can see, there are two 0s in there. Indeed, if you need 10 lines anyway, you can just use up the whole address space that they offer, which is 1024 bytes. Each new address line gives you the next power of 2 in address space, so it makes sense to use up that space with actual memory cells. This is an extremely simplified description of the electronics inside solid state storage devices, but you get the idea.
Oh boy, here we go. This is what I get asked when I get the "don't speak" task in drinking games.  A monad is a box for values. Either one value, or none, or many, doesn't matter. It's a box for values, and it adds additional *context* to the values. This context is specific to the concrete box implementation. Now, not every box is a monad. The easier box to start with is a *Functor*: it is a box that provides functionality to transform the values inside the box while keeping the box itself and it's context. The context doesn't change, but the value does.  Let's use two common examples: Option<T> and List<T> (going to use a weird java-esque pseudo code language here because it doesn't matter). Now, an Option<T> either holds a value of type T or it doesn't. That's the whole joke. The context of the box is that the value inside it might not be there. Schrödinger's value. This compares best to nullable values, but with explicit type safety and cooler features. Imagine this common null code: ``` var foo: T? = ... var bar: U? = ... if (foo != null)   bar = ... else return null if (bar != null)   return ... else return null ``` That's awful, but common code in Java (this code is more like Kotlin, which does have wannabe-monadic features for nullables tho) What happens here is: if the value is present, you do something with it. Then when that value is present, you do something with that. As soon as something stops, return nothing.  This is where Option shines. A *Functor* is a box `Box<A>` with a `map` method, which takes a function `A -> B` and returns a `Box<B>`. Basically, it applies the passed function to the values in the box without changing the box. For options, it means that when a value is present, the value is transformed through the function. Otherwise the value stays missing.  ``` var foo: Option<T> = ... var bar: Option<U> = foo.map(v => ...) return bar.map(v => ...) ``` We now keep the context (value there are not?) Implicitly without needing to drag it along. The code becomes much nicer. It's also typesafer than the nullable example because you explicitly need to handle the case that there is no value before you can actually use the value.  Similar for lists: you know a list. A list wraps a number of values and gives them a fixed order. The context is the *order* of the values. (A set would have the context that the values are unique). Consider the following classic code: ``` var foo: List<A> = ... var bar: List<B> = new List() for (var v in foo) bar.Add(quoz(v)) return bar ``` Now imagine a lot of transformations. Many loops. Maybe they use indices directly. Either way, it gets ugly real quick. But what we actually do here is apply the `quoz` function to all values in `foo`, and that's it. So why not just write ``` var foo: List<A> = ... return foo.map(quoz) ``` And we're done! We kept the size and order (the context) but transformed all the values. This is what a Functor does.  But what about monads? Well, besides a lot of math details that don't matter much in practice, functors have a serious problem:  ``` Option<T> quoz(T value) { ... } var foo: Option<T> = ... var bar: Option<Option<T>> = foo.map(quoz) ``` Oof. A nested Functor! Functors are General, they do not do anything with the context of the box, so there's no way to unpack that nested option. And a nested option doesn't make sense. There's no difference between the outer option having no value and the inner option having no value. So how do we unpack this?  *This logic is specific to the concrete box implementation and the context*. You can compose different functors because they are independent of the concrete context. This doesn't work anymore.  This is where monads shine: a monad is a box that has a `bind` or `flatMap` method. This takes a function `A => Box<B>` and returns a `Box<B>`. Compare this to `map`, which when given that func would return a `Box<Box<B>>`. The monad is responsible for *squashing nested boxes into a single box`. It merges the contexts of two nested boxes of the same type into a single context.  For options, this is trivial: if either the inner or the outer box is empty, the resulting option is empty. Otherwise use the inner value.  For lists, you can think of multiple ways to turn nested lists into a single list. The most common implementation is to just concatenate each inner list = iterate all inner lists in order and add the elements to a single large list and return that.  This omits a lot of detail and theory (and mathematicians and Haskell fans will cry about this answer) but I hope it gets the basic idea across: squashing boxes.
Machine learning is specific artificial intelligence, yes. You can write a program to perform a task. You then grade it on that task, and adjust its settings based on its grade. Do this over and over 1000 times and you will eventually have the settings just right to perform the task very well. It has "learned". The programmer may not even know precisely how or why the final config works, and that's fine. All they care about is that it works.
CDs and DVDs send digital data, so a string of 1's and 0's. There needs to be a "Brain" somewhere that can convert those 1's and 0's into a song (or in the case of a DVD, audio and video.) The laser is looking at the surface of the disk. Some parts of the disk are shiny, so that the laser gets reflected. Other parts of the disk are not shiny, and do not reflect the laser. This is a vast oversimplification but essentially those are your two states - your 1 and 0 - did the laser reflect, or not?
A git repository is essentially a folder, and everything in that folder is part of the repository. Git keeps track of what is in the files, and what files are there. Thus it knows when a file is added, removed or even changed. In order to update the repository with changes you made, you tell git: "hey these are the adjustmentd that I want to make in the repository" and 'stage' the changes. You can then create what is called a commit and describe what you've done by saying I am now going to commit to making these changes. Lastly you can "push" your committed changes to the repository. Someone else might want your made changes and can then "pull" the changes you "pushed" to the repository. This way you can stay up-to-date with the latest made changes.
Games are orders of magnitude more complex now, so the chance for bugs is higher. But more important is the ability to patch them after launch. It used to be that you got a game on physical media, and that was it. A severe bug could cripple an otherwise okay game and there was no way to fix it. Now, it may still do some damage to the game's initial popularity, but it's not quite the killer it used to be.
You press a button on a type-writer-like device. This sends a signal to one of 26 inputs on a dial which then sends it to one of the 26 outputs. The relationship between the position of the inputs and outputs is random. The output of this dial connects to the input of a second dial which scrambles the position again. This then goes to a third dial and repeat. Lastly, the signal goes to a switch board that has a port for every letter of the alphabet. For 10 of these letters, there is a plug connecting them. So if a plug connects "A" and "T", and the output from the dials would lead to "A", then the plug board changes it to "T" (and vice versa). Basically, by pressing a letter on this typewriter, the machine changes it into a different letter through a complex and convoluted process. Even though this process is strictly deterministic, it is so complex that it is difficult to reverse engineer it (to be given an output letter and figure out what the input letter would be). Also, the physical act of pressing a key causes the dials to turn which rearranges how the letters are scrambled. So if you pressed the same letter twice, it would result in two different outputs, with the mathematical relationship between them heavily obfuscated. Despite that complexity, if you knew the settings of the machine (the specific three dials used, their initial settings, and the plug board settings), you can decipher and replicate any message. Military personnel would have code books which would have that days settings. These initial settings would be used to securely sending new settings for each individual message. This was hard to break because between all of the possibilities, there were just too many settings to try and brute force a solution. By the time you could do that, the message you decrypted would be obsolete.
Typically I wouldn't expect so.  Hardware specs within at least apple product lines are pretty steadfast and there really aren't defect recalls right now That isn't true in general product line.   It's pretty obvious that a car produced within months of another car by the same brand name can be different.   But even with much stricter product line definitions, a change in vendors or a bad batch of the same vendor's components during the production run can change the quality or performance of the final product.  That's why you commonly hear of things like recalls on products made between the months of X and XX, even though the product itself as marketed hasn't changed in years.
Boot Camp allows you to install Windows operating system on a Mac computer, alongside Mac OS. This only works on Intel-based Macs because Windows is only compatible with that hardware. Microsoft does not yet make available a consumer version of Windows compatible with Apple's M1 chip. Pro: the OS is running natively on the hardware, making full use of the hardware. Con: a computer can only run one operating system at a time, so you have to reboot to switch between them. Parallels Desktop is virtualisation software. It creates a pretend computer, within which you can install and run another operating system, like Windows. Pro: you can switch between Mac OS and Windows seamlessly and without rebooting. Con: it's virtualisation, so performance can suffer. So if you want the Boot Camp experience while using Parallels...just reboot your computer every time you want to run Windows inside Parallels. I don't know why you'd want to do that, but you do you. It will still be virtualised of course, since Windows cannot natively run on the M1, so you still have the performance hit. CrossOver is completely different software. It implements a compatibility layer to allow Windows apps to run on non-Windows operating systems. Basically when an application runs, it expects certain functionality to be provided by the underlying operating system - drawing a GUI to screen, accessing file, talking to hardware, opening network connections, and much more. Different OSs mostly provide the same functionality but you need to talk to them in different ways. CrossOver sits between the application and the OS and translates those Windows function calls from the application into something the underlying Linux/Mac/Chrome OS can understand and perform. The reason not all apps works is that compatibility layers are rarely perfect, they are trying to exactly copy all of the functionality provided by an OS which is not fully documented, and will have weird quirks or edge cases, without having access to the source code of the OS.
Think of a computer as a restaurant. The CPU is the head chef. The head chef can make any dish requested at an extremely fast speed. However they are expensive so a restaurant only has a the head chef and a few sous chefs (CPU cores). They are great for doing a set of single dishes very well but are slow at handling large loads. The GPU are the line chefs. They are individually slower than the head chef but there are many of them. They need very specific instructions to create each dish but once they have it down, they can produce them in huge numbers like for catering a wedding. GPUs need specific programming which often differs from regular coding to be effective and work well for handling large, repeated, and parallel actions. RAM is the counter space in the restaurant. More is better for holding the ingredients (data) being processed without the chefs having to run to storage (hard drive).
[From another time this was asked:](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/325jq6/eli5if_the_nintendo_64_was_64bit_and_modern/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) Bit width is roughly analogous to how many passengers can fit into a car at one time. It is just one component of performance (how many people are in any given single arrival/departure). You can make hardware faster lots of other ways, the same way you could build more direct roads, faster cars, adding more lanes, better traffic management. Bit width by itself tells you a little (how precise or large one operation can be) but doesn't really tell you much about the systems performance. One of the bigger things influenced by the bit width of the CPU is how much system memory can be directly addressed. More addressable memory means that programs can get larger and run faster (storing more stuff in memory instead of on disk) and that more programs can run at the same time.
This is a gross oversimplification, but here's my best shot. You place your letter in an envelope and pass it to the post man. The postman places that envelope in a box and passes it to the distributor. The distributor places that in a crate and loads it into a truck. The truck drives from one distributor to another. The receiving distributor opens the crate and removes the box then hands it a postman. The postman takes the envelope out of the box and passes it to the recipient. The recipient opens the envelope and reads the letter.  Possible examples of attacks could include imposters receiving the delivery at any stage (man in the middle), the postman delivering a bag of overstuffed envelopes at one time (DDOS), or someone stealing your delivery (unauthorized access).
Song copyrights are over the lyrics and actual musical notes. The recording copyright are just on the specific recording. So if she owned the songs, but not the recordings, she could re-record and own the whole thing.
First let’s talk about the CPU. The cpu has a bunch of groups of 64 transistors (hence why they’re called 64 bit), called registers. Each register has a specific function but we’ll focus on the SP (stack pointer) register. The CPU also has a special device called an oscillator (also known as clock) which vibrates billions of times per second (GHz), causing a voltage switch back and forth between high and low. Due to how the CPU is physically wired, every time this voltage swaps (also known as clock cycle) a series of voltages are induced on a bunch of transistors. Which voltages go on which transistors is dictated by the voltages present on specific transistors on the RAM memory via the SP register. If all transistors of the SP are 0 the voltages and registers are indicated by the first 8 bits (first byte) of the RAM, if only the last transistor is 1, it’s the second byte and so on. The SP itself is affected by the contents of the memory, causing it to point to a different byte after each clock cycle. Fast forward to the human typing on the keyboard. A software (compiler) converts those words to machine code (voltages) which are set in the RAM. When the application starts, the SP is pointed at the first byte of the compiled machine code and off we go.
A couple of reasons. Older operating systems had a limit of the size of the volumes they could mount. To use a really big hard drive, it had to be partitioned into multiple smaller volumes. As someone else said, optimizing storage. The operating system stores files in units called blocks and clusters. In older operating systems (and some  newer ones, for all I know), a file would be spread over a whole number of blocks. If the file didn't completely fill the "last" block, the unused space in that block couldn't be used for anything else. For example, say a volume was configured to save files in 1-kilobyte blocks and your file is 4.1 kilobytes. The operating system will need 5 blocks to save the file. That fifth block only holds 0.1 kilobyte of data and the other 0.9 kilobytes is unavailable to other files. When you split a drive into multiple volumes, you can configure each volume to use a different block and cluster size. If you know what size files you're likely to save to the volume, you can select a block size that's most efficient. You want to use the smallest number of blocks per file (because that makes read/write operations faster) without wasting lots of space on the final block of each file. If you know you're mostly going to fill the volume log files that are usually around 1 MB, you can choose a smaller block size. If you know you're going to store image files that run 50MB - 200MB, you can choose a larger block size.
The vast majority of CPU computations don't actually include *any* form of error correction (in a standard commercial CPU). Error correction is mostly limited to memory arrays and transmission protocols.  Inside the logic blocks of a CPU, there is almost none.       That's because errors are extremely uncommon.  The circuits are normally very reliable.  There are a few things that can make them screw up...radiation induced soft errors, voltage fluctuations, crosstalk, etc.      I can't give you an exact number for the rate at which all errors occur...there are lots of variables.  Probably on the order of 1 per 10^6 - 10^9 device-hours. (Soft errors alone tend to be in the 10^9 range.)        But it definitely does happen.  Some errors are almost totally benign; some cause an error that crashes a program or the OS; some cause an error in a computation that is not obvious. That last one, called "transparent data corruption" is actually the worst in many ways.  No one wants to rely on a processor to do a critical calculation if the processor can give a bad result without any sign that it's wrong.  In a worst-case scenario, that can have some very bad repercussions.      *Source: I'm a former microprocessor reliability engineer.*
The definition of a game engine is essentially: what you have left over if you take the game out of the game. It's all the behind-the-scenes stuff that makes everything work. You look at the screen and see a picture of a dragon - that's the game. Somebody had to draw a dragon and put that in the game. What about the code that turns the drawing into 3D pixels? That's the engine.  So the engine is actually the majority of the code in the "game". It's not surprising it affects almost everything.  Yes, every engine has its upper limits. Something like the original Doom, for example, was designed to run on a DOS computer in 1994 or whatever, and it takes a lot of shortcuts for speed, and has a lot of limitations to make those shortcuts work. You can't look up or down in the original Doom. And the monsters aren't even 3D. Those are the limitations people accepted in exchange for getting it to work at all. Sometimes there are fundamental design tradeoffs. For example, Factorio has a multiplayer mode. There's a lot of stuff happening in a Factorio game and it would be laggy if the server had to keep telling every player what was happening around them. So what it actually does is each player's computer runs the entire game and they stay synced up. But this means you can't have anything in the game that's random, because they'd get out of sync. Even things that seem random aren't actually random. It also means every player's computer needs to download a copy of the entire game world, when they log in. And it means if anyone's computer is too slow to run the game at normal speed, everyone gets slowed down, or that person gets kicked out. So you can either have multiplayer that isn't laggy, **or** people with slow computers can play multiplayer, but not both. And changing from one to the other means rewriting the whole multiplayer part of the game from scratch. If you show someone a game that's designed to avoid the lag and ask how slow computers can play multiplayer without slowing everything down, the answer is they can't. It's not that it's impossible; it's just impossible *in that engine design with the fast multiplayer*. If you changed it it wouldn't be the same multiplayer engine any more. Hope this helps.
Just like decimal numbers but your digits roll over when hitting two instead of ten. 0 is 0.  1 is 1.  2 is 10. 3 is 11. Just keep counting in your head from 0. First digit from the right is 1? Add 1. Second digit from the right is one? Add two. Third? Add four. Eventually you'll get through the whole number and you'll have tallied up all the components in decimal.
The answer is that they aren't placed in there, they're etched. If you're imagining a machine that solders millions of tiny transistors onto the chip, that's not how it works at all. Those bajillions of transistors are made in-place, by chemically treating the surface of a solid chunk of pure silicon, and using microscopic 'stencils' to sorta burn the circuit on there, turning parts of the surface into functional transistors in the process. The transistors *could* be damaged in the handling of a naked chip, but chips are hardly ever shipped naked. They're almost always securely embedded in some protective material, like epoxy resin. The transistors won't be exposed to anything except the more 'penetrative' stuff like x-rays and whatnot.
Yes The first six digits of the card number are the Issuer Identification Number (IIN).  Card that start with 4 or 5 are issued by banks and financial institutions.  You can look up where the card originated.  Some info from Wikipedia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7812
They don't, unless there's some new satellite network I haven't heard of. GPS satellites are just sitting there broadcasting signals, and devices listen to these signals to extrapolate their location based on the timing of the signals. They don't need any significant bandwidth because they broadcast the same simple message to everyone. Satellite phone satellites and communications satellites tend to have fairly limited networks - not a lot of users rely on their network so they don't need insane amounts of bandwidth.
It's not just about clock speed in GHz. Newer processors have extra hard coding built in to them called instruction sets.  Just imagine this hypothetical scenario, every cpu has a clock speed of 1 tick per second (1Hz) now this means it can do 1 operation per second so 1 + 2 = 3 would be roughly be done like Tick 1 - fetch the 1st number from memory and store it in the calculator as m1 Tick 2 - fetch the 2nd number from memory and store it in the calc as m2 Tick 3 - ADD m1 and m2 Tick 4 = store the answer in a memory location Now that is extremely simplified but let's say it takes 4 ticks or 4 seconds to carry out that task. If you add an instruction set that already knows the answer to 1+2=3 then it will use the instruction and manage it in 1 or 2 ticks. The newer chip with that instruction set coded in can carry out the same task in less ticks. This is why pc's are not just about GHz. Above is not actually what happens but just trying to make it as simple as I can, to understand why newer processors can perform faster at the same speed
That sounds like an issue unless you mistyped 477 GB, that would be expected. The reason for that is that there are two different competing definitions for terms like kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte etc. When computers first stared regularly having to deal with thousands of bytes engineers needed a shorted way of expressing those numbers. The problem was that computer memory etc was arranged based on powers of two and our normal ways of describing numbers is based on powers of 10 (or rarely when we use dozens 12). For a computer having  65536 bytes was a perfectly round number. Nut if you said over 65 thousand bytes that would be inexact. so they cam up with a trick 2 to the tenth power is 1024 and 1024 is close to 1000 so they simply used the metric prefixes with the understatement that a kilobyte was not 1000 byte but 1024 byte. That turned 65536 into exactly 64 Kilobyte. You could use short numbers and didn't lose any precision. This went on for a while as computers got bigger and megabyte gigabyte and so on got defined along the same lines each 1024 times more than the last instead of 1000 times. This worked for a while. However it upset the people from in charge of the metric system. They were the ones who had created the kilometer, kilogram, kilowatt, kilovolt, kilohertz and all the others and it always meant 1000 of the unit. Having a bunch of computer people come and take their words and use them for something else was upsetting them. So they decided that engineers should use different names is they meant anything else than powers of 1000. they suggested engineer use kibibyte for 1024 byte and have kilobyte be 1000 byte as it should be. Nobody listened to them at first, but they were the guys who made the legal standards. at some point some intrepid marketing guy realized that they could use this confusion to make their products sound bigger than they actually were. They just needed a small asterisk and a tiny disclaimer that they were using the SI-unit definition of the word and nobody could sue them for fraud. You can tell that this is the only reason they use the definition because some of the same companies that sell drives with this power of 1000 definition also sell memory with power od 1024 definition. They only use the definition that suits them the most. 512 Gigabyte according to the SI-guys definition is 477 Gigabytes according to the old definition. So if you have a 512 GB SSD that your computer shows as only having 477 GB that is normal. If it only shows 377 GB something else is going like a hidden partition or some hardware fault.
There are some places where cargo vans have lower taxes then personal cars. The concept is that people who need a van to carry around their tools for work is not taxes as much as people who just want a big car for their convenience. And the definition of a cargo van for tax purposes is commonly a two seat vehicle with a certain sized separated cargo area. So by removing the rear seats and install a separator wall behind the front seats the car might fit under the definition of a cargo van and therefore get lower taxes.
The file gets written to whatever storage medium is being used by the device. For a Desktop that could be SSD drives that use flash memory which is basically interpreting electrical charges as data to store memory. Data can also be saved on HDDs which is a drive of spinning magnetic disks and the magnetic field is interpreted as data. When you "delete" a file, it's not actually removed. The place it's stored has a bit(1 or 0) that indicates if that particular spot in memory is being used. When you "delete" something, that file's memory is marked as not in use. Then sometime later(who knows if or when) your computer will write over that memory with something new. This is why data can be recovered from HDDs and SSDs for things like legal trials.
There are many ways to modulate the carrier with data.  Let's look at your 2400Mhz carrier AM radio.  If I sent 10 cycles per bit, then I can send 240Mb/sec - so that's my bandwidth.  Lots of radio circuitry can filter out pretty high noise levels if there are 10 cycles in which to figure it out.  If I only send 2 cycles for each bit, I have more bandwidth in the channel, 1.2Gb/sec but a tiny bit of noise can cause my filters to make a bit error.  While it might seem like 5 times more data, if I have to wait for a packet retransmission, my effective bandwidth in actual use might be much, much lower.  The actual bandwidth peak is a complex combination of factors like the shielding of conductors and the sources of background noise.
Very simply put: the *basic* communication standard for video games (driver, API etc) etc has been the same for many years, hence the ability to run old games. Even far older games from the MS DOS area could run with emulators and virtual machines, and services like GOG make money with bringing old games to current operating systems. Imagine having an old car from the 1920 ... could probably still drive on a highway, but not very nice & shiny.  SYL
It's like comparing a bicycle to a motorcycle by saying both have two wheels. Even with similar amount of RAM, PC hardware is far  more powerful than a smarthphone. Components like CPU, storage, display, even the RAM *type* is likely superior to that of your phone,   Not to mention PC being able to handle multiple USB devices, multiple harddrives, display cards, network connections, etc. All of which requires additional hardware adding to the weight.
The exact details are kept secret, and changed frequently, to keep spammers from circumventing it. However there are a lot of metrics by which companies can identify who you are when browsing the web, like your exact web browser and OS version, cookies, and what site you're coming from. One of the things they can look at is how botlike your behavior is. Like, do you browse youtube 24/7 liking thousands of videos and leaving comments, yet never watching a video? Definitely a bot. Do you watch a video most of the way through before leaving a comment, then leaving and shopping for pistachios? Probably not a bot.
Video Engineer here! Imagine you and your little toddler brother are both painting on a different sized canvas. Yours is 1 foot wide and his is 2 feet wide. You grab your brush and paint a beautiful scenery with a waterfall and animals. Your little brother draws a smiley face on his. Even though his canvas is bigger, the amount of detail is lesser and less paint strokes were used. In more technical terms, although frame size does typically have an impact on the file size, it's only a small fraction of it. What really dictates how big a file is, is based on it's bitrate. The bitrate is composed of how detailed the image is and it includes color and luminescence.
Imagine you have a big empty warehouse, the size of a football field. It's pitch black except for a light by the door. You can't see anything. You can just stroll in, but you'll trip over all sorts of things. In the end, you'll probably get lost. Defining a variable is drawing a glowing box on the floor of the warehouse and erecting an illuminated sign on the edge of the box that says "sugar". Now, provided you find the sign and walk directly towards it, you won't trip over anything. You can store the sugar, retrieve it later, and get back to the door when you need to leave. Defining a variable is both the box and the sign - it's simpler, but you're restricted to certain predefined boxes that go with certain predefined signs. Malloc is just the box - you're left to erect whatever sign you want after calling it.
A neural network is made up of neurons. The neurons of a neural network are basically just pieces of code. Very simple individually. They simply take one or more numbers as inputs, perform some mathematical calculations, then spit out and output. Very commonly the calculation they perform is to multiply each input by some number (a weight), then add the results all together and put out the sum. You take a bunch of neurons and arrange them in layers. Each output from each neuron in one layer feeds into each input of each neuron in the next layer. The first and last layers of the network are special. The neurons of the first layer generally only take a single input and the last layer consists of a single neuron that takes, as input, all of the outputs of the layer above it and then provides a single sum (as normal) but "normalizes" that sum by forcing it to be a value between 0 or 1 (or sometimes forcing it to be only 0 or 1). The "magic" of neural networks are the chosen weights for each neuron. Since neural networks can get fairly complex, there are some strategies, often involving feedback loops, where you can "train" a neural network on known data to produce the desired output, then unleash it on unknown data.
It has to do with how difficult it is to actually calculate something as a file transfer, you might think it's just a matter of measuring the space something takes up and divide by transfer speeds - but neither is consistent in a running system. Copying one file might mean many different things, it could be a folder or an archive - which is in fact not one file but many smaller files tied together with a system link of some sort.  Think of it like moving boxes, you have 100 boxes you are supposed to move from point A to point B - but some boxes are under some furniture, which means it takes longer to access, some boxes contain only glassware so you have to be careful, some boxes have their contents thrown all over the place. So what you might do is take an average time it takes for you to move each box - but what if the last 10 boxes are all super slippery and heavy suddenly? Then your estimate would be wildly off. This is basically why most modern systems are so bad at estimating time.  The alternative approach would be to spend more time figuring out exact content and weight of each box *before* copying it - the issue is such a calculation would take a substantial time compared to just copying the content. So would you want to wait 5 seconds to know it only takes 3 seconds to transfer a file? Probably not right.
Depends which memory it needs, but usually the answer is "the OS has a table of contents for its memory it can refer to".  If it is from RAM the program will usually just tell it the address. When running the program at some point the program goes "OK! I need you to take the value in location 0xABCDEF and add five to it" or what whatnot. The program can also do relative addressing ("go back ten from the stack pointer") or sequential memory (go to this location and scan everything until you hit a NULL). Now, the program usually isn't actually given access to the actual memory in the computer and is instead given a "sandbox" where it will look like the entire computer's ram is at its disposal. The operating system will handle the fine details of translating from virtual memory to physical memory.  If you need something to the hard drive then the OS has a giant table / index that tells it where everything on disc is it can refer to.
1s and 0s are merely convenient building blocks to build more complicated things. One can come up with millions of different ways to interpret a sequence of 1s and 0s.  Same way how Spanish and English use the same Latin alphabet but mean completely different things and can't necessarily be understood by the speakers of the opposite. x86 and ARM are merely languages in this sense, humans designed them then designed processors to interpret them. They cannot understand the other language, just as the average Englishman cannot understand Spanish.
That's entirely possible, but not beneficial in the slightest.     Text itself is also stored as a pattern of bits, usually 8 per individual character, although sometimes more (and in the old days sometimes less). Supposing that you were to do what you suggested, all you'd really accomplish is inflating the file size by a factor of 8 and making it impossible to meaningfully read the contents of the file without converting everything back first.     Also, nothing's stopping you from backing up a file the good old-fashioned way with copy and paste.
What do you want to do that you don't think you're capable of doing?   I ask because what your describing sounds to me a lot like a remote-desktop or in-house streaming situation, and there are several decent options for doing that in 2021, so I'm not sure what you think you can't do.
You press button. Button closes circuit. Circuit sends electric signal to computer. Computer notices electric signal and alerts the OS. The OS takes note of what process has focus and puts a "Hey, this key has been pressed" in to the message queue of the process. The process checks message queue and sees the message. The process sets a flag that this button was pressed this frame. The code controlling your movement checks the flag when processing movement and starts moving your character.
Short answer: The Connection. RAM is closer to the CPU and uses higher bandwidth connections to make access much faster. There’s actually another layer of memory even faster than RAM called Cache that sits right on the CPU die.  Storage disks communicate by another standard, which is mostly a cable. So it’s inherently slower. Hard drives have another issue, they have a magnetic disk that spins really fast and a magnetic head that moves along them. It’s limited by the speed of those mechanisms. Few people use Harddrives these days apart from bull data storage.  NVMe storage is a new method of storage disk however that uses a bus built into the motherboard and can achieve near RAM like speeds (in theory)
There are two main differences. The first one is related to the language features and the other is about references. If your data objects contain no references to another data objects in the same file, then the difference is very little and appears when certain file formats just can not be expressed in terms of a given programming language. For example, it is possible to have a sequence of bytes with a counter in the file, but relative structure in C does not exist, but in Pascal it could be a string, but it depends on implementation. Also there is a problem with byte order, which can cause data written on one computer to be unreadable on another. If your data objects contain references to another data objects, there is another issue. In static typed programming languages references are usually memory addresses. In a file - what are they? They could be offsets within a file, but in this case some adjustment is necessary in order to interpret the file contents as a memory contents. BTW, it is similar to what an OS does when it loads EXE or ELF executable file. In dynamic languages like Python references are more complex things than just addresses. For your second question - if these issues are taken into account, we can just save and transfer data structures. But typically people are looking for a universal solutions that have no such issues. So there are XML, JSON, serialization, etc.
A signed distance field is a funky way to define surfaces. Suppose I want  to define a sphere...one way is to say "the center is here and the radius is R". Suppose I want to define a cube...I could say "the corners are here and there's a flat surface between them". But you can see that those aren't really compatible descriptions...I can't define a sphere by it's corners and I can't define a cube by it's center and side length (without also specifying the orientation, at least). A signed distance field is a generic way to define basically any surface...for every point in space, you assign a number. That number is how far that point is from the surface (the distance), and you give it a positive or negative sign...positive if it's inside, negative if it's outside (or vice versa...it doesn't really matter as long as you're consistent). All the points that have a value of "0" define the surface, everything else has some positive or negative value.  This has some advantages when trying to do video games...it's really easy to merge surfaces. Just add together the signed distance fields. It's really easy to tell if you're inside or outside the merged surface (what's the sign?). It's really easy to tell how far you are from the nearest surface (what's the SDF value at this point?). Etc. There's some really cool YouTube videos that show them in action in real time that make the actual math a lot more transparent.
<repost> It's a combination of factors:       More tasks / software bloating - The strongest of these is that normally you are asking your computer to do more tasks than before - some of this is subtle stuff brought in with Windows Updates and especially Chrome updates. Chrome started nice and efficient and a hell of a lot faster than Internet Explorer but has slowly gotten fatter and fatter. But it's not solely the browser's fault. As PC Processing Power, PC Memory, Browser Stability and internet speeds have all generally increased so websites have gotten more and more resource intensive (especially with the copious amounts of various advertising they force on you). The same holds true for a lot of software out there - that as PCs become more powerful so the software changes to leverage more of that power.       Security, security, security - A HUUUGE part of OS, browser and software updates is security based. It's very, very seldom that security updates result in increased speed or performance.       Failure Rates - RAM, CPUs, GPUs, HDDs, SSDs all have failure rates and these tend to get worse over time especially if there's significant heat in your system. I not talking total failure I'm talking bad sectors, I'm talking memory parity errors. Modern day OS and firmware do an immensely good job at handling this invisibly. Often you may not be aware that you have bad sectors at all. The sector has been discretely marked off limits and a replacement sector has been allocated. But when that happens it's basically introducing a permanent fragmentation onto your drive.       OS / Registry scarring - Back in the good of days of Windows 98 it was a pretty regular thing to reformat your system at least once a year - sometimes due to a complete OS crash - but often wanting to have a clean version on because over time you add and remove programs, you get the occasional virus, you run registry cleaners and you install a ton of updates and well as any tinkering you may have done yourself in the registry. This all leads to the registry and system files not functioning as well as it should. Registry cleaners are a mixed bag - they spot a lot of problems but their solution is to delete the problems.       Top Recommendations:       Antivirus - check that you only have one anti-virus on your system and that's it's not McAfee. Multiple antivirus apps will interfere with each other. These days Windows Security is an excellent choice for your antivirus needs.       Switch to an SSD - If you haven't switched yet and you can afford it I would highly recommend it. It's faster and doesn't suffer from fragmentation (assuming you don't live with your system drive 99.95% full). HDDs are still good for storage drives but your system and games should be running off an SSD.       Clean install - Especially if you've upgraded between windows versions or even between major builds you will be surprised how much better your PC will run on a fresh system. This goes well with upgrading to an SSD. Download the USB installer from Microsoft's website and get a completely fresh version of Windows with no manufacturer bloatware on it. Do make sure that you've backed up EVERYTHING you need: files, passwords, websites.       Remove software that you're not using - especially any software that installs it's own services. I try where possible to use portable versions of applications - that way you know that they're not cluttering up your registry, system files and services. Also always check if there isn't a default windows app that does what you want already.       Hosts file - Use your hosts file to block advertising sites - this is fairly technical and I don't recommend for the average user but it's preferable to using ad blocker software. It's a fast, nasty but uncomplicated firewall essentially. What I do when I find a website that's running slow it I analyze that particular website on webpagetest.org - I identify the external links which are causing delays and block those via my hosts file.       Upgrade you memory - definitely these days if someone has only 4gigs my instant recommendation is upgrade, upgrade, upgrade. Running Windows 10 you want 8gigs minimum.
With SPI, one device is the master and the other is the slave.  There's one line to send bits to the slave (master-in-slave-out MISO), and another line to send bits to the master (master-out-slave-in MOSI).  The master also controls a clock, the bits are supposed to be read when the clock changes. There's also usually a CE (chip enable) line, allowing multiple devices to sharethe same MISO, MOSI and clock.  So if you have e.g. 5 SPI devices, you'd have 5 CE connections, plus shared MISO, MOSI and clock.  At any one time, you'd disable 4 of the CE connections. You'll need to read the data sheet for the chip and microcontroller to understand the specifics -- timing requirements, whether bits are sent on rising / falling clock edge, and what is the format / meaning of data exchange with a specific device (for example, you have a SPI temperature sensor:  What bits do you send to ask for a temperature reading, and what bits can you expect in return?  You have to read the temperature sensor data sheet to answer this question). There are also lots of platform specific SPI tutorials for Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, etc. You can manually toggle MOSI and CLK to send one bit at a time (or toggle CLK and read MISO to receive one bit at a time).  Most microcontrollers also have built-in SPI peripheral hardware on certain pins, the peripheral hardware can send/receive a limited number of bits on its own without CPU intervention.
API - Application Programming Interface. Basically a set of rules that you follow to interact with a system. A real world example would be a form. "Fill in your name here, your account number there, the amount in USD, sign and submit to X".  RPC - Remote Procedure Call. Making something happen on another system. An API in general can apply to your own computer, RPC is about to talking to some other system. REST API - A particular kind of API made to work well with the HTTP protocol that's used by the web.
Most titles nowadays are developed using some form of “middleware”; for instance, Unity. This middleware helps make all platforms work in largely the same manner. This means you can develop and design a game on Unity 4 and it will run on Unity 5. A decent rule of thumb is that you can double the poly count every two years. So the art staff has a target for the artwork. It’s okay if the frame rate is low early in the project; the hardware will rise up to meet you.
Sadly, there are oodles of DFs.  There is the .DOC and .DOCX formats made by Microsoft Word.  Then there is the .FM format made by FrameMaker.  Each company makes many and there are far too many and none of them are portable, sometimes they are proprietary secrets.
Hi :-) In order to make chips, you're using light to project the chip's structure onto photo sensitive material. Thus the result is always a flat chip. You could of course stack multiple of these, but then you could never efficiently get the heat away from the layers inside that "sandwich". The layers would overheat. As for computers,  there are (server) mainboards that can take 2 or 4 processors. That's one way to get more chips...
They do not have the same graphics output.  Not even close really. First, they are simply not the same thing.  Laptops share a lot of components whereas a dedicated graphics card has all of its own hardware.  Heck, a modern Nvidia/AMD graphics card is bigger than a whole MacBook board. They will advertise good numbers but the devil is in the details they never tell you about. Mainly the issue is heat.  Large graphics cards can dissipate heat much better.  When a laptop heats up it throttles CPU and GPU speeds to keep temps tolerable. This happens well before a full sized graphics card would.
Storage mostly. From the guys that did it the algorithm took some 318TB of storage and 101 days. Could they have just added more hard drives and waited longer sure, but a computer crunching out digits of pi isn't doing useful work and the guys that own the computer aren't generally going to be too willing to extend what amounts to a publicity stunt for much longer than they need to make a new record.  So they pick a number to stop at, estimate the time and storage it's going to take, hit the go button and wait till it's done.
Because the terrorbyte must have a scary cost! Joking about the typo aside, the bigger the memory card, the more densely the storage microelectronics need to be packed together. Since the size of a microSD is fixed (along with the power it can use to work) it becomes a lot more complicated for chipmakers to cram ever more data onto the same die. Also, right now, there are worldwide chip shortages. This is due to COVID - many industries had to close for a time, so chip making factories and the industries that supplied them have been idle for a while. Now that things are slowly returning to normal, demand is going up again but production has not yet ramped up. This results in shortages and higher prices for all things with microelectronics.
RAM transistors and EEPROM (SSD) transistors are quite different in how they are constructed and how they are used.  In order to store data on EEPROM transistors even when power is not present, a fairly strong electric field is applied to push/pull electrical charges from the floating gate part of the transistor.  Over time, this tends to damage the very very thin insulator and wear it out.       RAM cells don't do that.  They don't even have a floating gate. So they don't tend to get worn out very easily.      SRAM is already much much faster than SSDs, but can't be used in situations where the power is going to be turned off.
This is a very complicated question.   I'll try to explain as simply as I can. Basically, when you're making a big-budget animation, you have different teams of people doing different things.   Some people make all the different models and assets (like plants, carts, tables, etc).  They use software like Maya, or Blender, or whatever they are trained to use.   Other people make the textures, so that things actually look like skin, metal, wood, etc. (texturing also "fakes" a lot of small, details). They use Photoshop, Substance Designer, or any other suited program they have agreed upon.   Others still prepare things for animation, by giving movable object virtual bones, and controls for the movements.   There are teams that do the animating itself, and teams that take care of lighting. There are people who do the composting of all the various datasets and renders, and so on.   A lot of studios, like Pixar, write their own software to allow them to expand the functionality of whatever software they use.    They look different because they have a certain design and motion language thst they actively stick to.  Also, there's people with separate skillsets, and there's the custom software aspect.   The 2d/3d blend is often referred to as cel-shading, or more commonly as "NPR", or "non-photorealistic  rendering".   It's achieved by not at all trying to recreate real materials. Sometimes, the textures are straight up (digitally) hand painted, with visible brushstrokes, and sometimes a crazy amount of advanced math goes into making Spiderman's outlines look hand drawn by doing unholy things with his silhouette in every frame.
Because you don’t become a trillion dollar company by making a product that lasts someone forever. You need them to buy a new one each year, so you hold back some new piece of tech advancement for the following year.  I’m sure advancements do happen year over year, but phone improvements specifically seem very incremental…
You load them with liquid resin or plastic or some other material and then the printer “builds” the design layer by layer, hardening the material as it goes. Precisely what material gets used and how it constructs the object depends on the specifics of the printer and its design, but that’s the basic idea.
Most emulators do whats called HLE or "high level emulation".  This means they arent actually simulating the original hardware 1:1, but instead, they sorta simplify things so that its easier to compute.  This works for most games released on a platform.  However, some games used really weird low level development tricks to accomplish spectacular feats. Factor5's compression technology for the N64 is avgood example of this sorta thing, and so for a long time, games that used it, like rogue squadron or RE2 simply didnt work on most emulators.  Now then, you can solve this in 2 ways: The first way is to use LLE, or "low level emulation". This is where you literally simulate the actual hardware 1:1. You write code that behaves just like the literal chips on the board of the original console. This way, all of those "weird tricks" devs used will still work, since your emulator function just like the old hardware. This isnt really feasible for consoles past the SNES's era, though -- it takes a massive amount of computing power, so when its used, it usually by emulator devs or people researching bugs in old games for stuff like speedrunning.  The second way, which is how its done most of the time, is to write a hack or fix that lets the game work with whatever HLE core youre running. For instance, we can emulate factor5 games nowadays because someone wrote a hack that understands how their compression tech worked, so now you can run these games with HLE because of the game-specific fix being applied to the HLE core.  Of course, since its game-specific, you have to write a new fix for each game that does something "weird", and not all games necessarily have such a fix written for them yet.
The name on something like DDR4-2400 is actually the transfers per second. It transmits at the rising and falling edge of each clock cycle, so it transmits 2.4 billion times per second but the bus clock is actually 1.2GHz, and the actual chips themselves are actually only 300MHz. A little complicated huh? So it's named off the amount of transfers it does per second. Which is linked to, but isn't the actual clock rate of the device. It gets even more complicated when you factor in that there's also Quad Data Rate RAM now too.
Well, this is insanely complicated, so not a great ELI5. But the basic idea is that it scans character by character, building a logic tree based on the rules of that language (called a "grammar"). Once it is done with that, each node in the logic tree has relevant lower level code (like assembly language, which is a way to talk to a processor more directly) assigned to it and turns the programming language into that new "lower level" language.  So if you had 3+5 for instance, the compiler would scan for an operation, in this case a + sign. It would make that a new operation if we can verify it adheres to the rules we set forth. In this case, the + must have numbers on both sides of it. So we make a graph where plus is the first node and it's children are the numbers. Then we sign the relevant lower level code to each node and compile it to that. So its basically just a way to map one language to another. Interpreting is basically the same thing. But compiling and interpreting have some differing challenges. Both follow the same basic process.  The parsing itself is a recursive process of character scanning based on our grammar
You only have 1 internet connection, and it's most likely running over copper wires. Copper has quality issues over longer distances. These big companies have many many internet connections all over the world made of fiber optic cables which can transmit data for miles with no significant signal degradation. Speeds of 10 or even 100 gigabits (1 gigabit = 1,000 megabits) are very common on these lines. And I do need to point out, these companies don't have all their stuff in one place, much less one country. For example if you go into Steam's settings you can in and select where you want your download to be done from. Steam has machines in all these locations, and those "terabits" are each location added up together. Steam's servers in Washington couldn't provide for the whole world's game download needs by themselves, but if everyone selects a location fairly close by (or the system makes reasonable guesses and auto-assigns locations) each location can be more reasonably sized. So, yeah, totally doable.
1nm is just a measurement. It doesn't have any other meaning than that - 1nm is no more significant than 1.5nm or 2 meters. What would limit process technology is likely to be physics and our ability to manipulate, measure and control stuff at smaller and smaller scales.  Perhaps we start working with photons instead of electrons. Or perhaps learn how to manipulate quantum states. Perhaps massively parallel computation architectures. There are areas to explore and develop other than simply reducing size.
Lets assume your processor has two memory controllers and each memory controller is connected to two memory slots, for four slots total. If you have one stick of RAM, you're using one memory controller. If you're using two sticks of RAM, you can read data from memory twice as quickly, provided you put the two sticks in slots connected to different memory controllers. If you put both sticks of RAM in slots connected to the same controller, you're throwing away performance, because one controller is going unused.
Sockets certainly do add to a lot of thickness as far as laptops go. Laptops are packaged such that every 0.1mm of thickness is precious and planned. Adding a socket that is easily 5-10mm is huge. Bear in mind, there needs to be airflow design internally for cooling and also heat spreading. With a socket, it is guaranteed that effective heat transfer only occurs on the top side. This compounds the problem because to get that much more heat on one side means much larger, noisier fans as well as much larger air channels.
They come with a fancy multifunction stylus that is stored within the phone itself. Aside from that, I find they are generally the same as the current Galaxy generation. Maybe a larger screen or whatnot.
The earliest programs were written directly in binary code. Processors are designed with a set of codes that perform specific actions. The programmers would then punch holes in cards that translated to those codes. It was very difficult. Then later, computer languages were born. They allow you to write in plain English, but the code then compiles into that same binary code.
Yup. It became a real competition too, youtubers/streamers would play for hours and hours straight trying to find the Easter eggs whenever a map was released. Sometimes the Devs would give hints, sometimes it really was just walking around spamming buttons or shooting at random things until something happened. They’d race to be the first to find the Easter eggs
The console manufacturers are not kind enough to hand out the full documentation, schematics and source code of the hardware and software. We don't know exactly how the consoles work.   So the emulator developers need to research the consoles on their own to find how they work.
Traditional wires use electricity to send data back and forth. Fiber optic cables use light (that gets sent via a bundle of strands of glass or plastic) to send data, and light is really, really fast. So fiber optic cables allow you to send data essentially at the speed of light, and at this point there's really nothing faster than that. Wifi is basically when you take the data that makes its way to your house (usually via wires), and sends that to specific devices by bouncing radio waves all over your house, eventually hitting your device (but this all happens so fast it feels instantaneous to us). Wifi is actually slower than fiber optic cables, but the wifi in your house is just getting signals to and from your modem (which connects your house with the rest of the world's internet-connected devices). So they're not really comparable because they're used for different things. Wifi is usually short distance connections between a small number of devices, but 'connecting to the internet' means you can try to connect to millions of devices across the world.
Some would copy all contents on to the hard disk while others used the CD for loading other assets.  It was also used as a means of anti-piracy, you couldn’t give it to your friend to install and play as well without them having to buy another copy.
Computational science is more research based...it's the mathematics of computation (basically, algorithm theory and related stuff). Industry \*uses\* lots of computational science but, unless you're on the bleeding edge, most companies aren't doing basic CS, they're just using the results. The relationship between CS and computer engineering is like the relationship between physics and aerospace engineering...the latter is using the mathematical tools & fundamental principles figured out by the former.
GPS satellites don't track anything except their own position. Otherwise, they just send out a signal that says where they were at and what time they sent the signal. That signal travels at the speed of light (about 300 million meters per second). Your GPS receiver receives the signal and calculates the distance based on how long it took between the time the signal was sent and the signal was received. You need a few (four) satellites to get a positive fix on your location.
Sure, if they have ongoing access to your hard drive, they can read all of it.  There are special evil-doer tools which make this easier, but they are going to be expending work to learn all about you.  It might turn out that you're not worth it, depending on who you are.   But, if you're worth billions, they might expend a lot of work to steal all your money.
Virtually all code is written in English. There was at least one effort to have code in French, and another in Arabic. Both failed. Most computer programming uses a few primitive words. The code is then rendered in a language only the computer can understand. For example, C, the code that makes most of the hardware and very low-level things work on the computer, only uses 32 words. So you don't have to learn the English language, simply 32 words, what they mean, and how to use them. With those, you create a series of various commands which make the computer do the work you want.  So coders only learn the actual programming language, not actual English or any language in the spoken or read way. Deep down, the actual code is translated from the letters and commands we use into numbers (typically hexadecimals), which the computer can use. The action of translating is called compiling, which is when coding language (which is almost readable) is translated into completely unreadable symbols which the computer knows how to handle. A large part of translation from the programming language (say C, C++, Rust, whatever) to the computer executable final state will highly depend on the physical CPU on the computer. For example, code compiled for x86\_64 chips (home computers) will not work on ARM chips (cell phones). The code might have the same underlying logic, but the specifications of the instructions the CPU chip understands needs to be defined for the compiled (translated, and other things not ELI5 level) version to work. However, most code is agnostic, which means most software can be cross-compiled to another platform. This simply means that code that works for the home computer will work on the phone, but you need to translate it twice, once for the PC, the other time for the phone. And neither final files will work on any other architecture except the one that was defined during compilation.
x86 refers to the architecture of the processor, a set of instructions that are common for those processors. Its sets the standard on how processors instructions work. In a sense you can think of it as the language the processor speaks, if they speak the same common language then programs can use a plethora of different processors the same way. That's why even old applications still work on modern CPUs It's called x86 because the early Intel processors that used this architecture were called the 286, 386, and 486 The Pentium processor was originally called 586, but they chose Pentium (from the Greek word for 5) because there was concern they couldn't copyright a number for the processor brand. Since then Intel has used words as codenames for chips like 'haswell' instead of numbers.
The thing is they can’t always make a high end cpu, sometimes it ends up defective, and the chances increase as we make transistors smaller and cpu dies larger, so instead of wasting the defective ones, they make them run slower, disable defective cores, and sell them as lower end CPUs
Research in general is expensive. You have to pay many many workhours of highly paid scientists and engineers. And they want to get their wage even if the research ends up in a dead end and they have to start over. Then once you have poured thousands of hours into a design you have to test it. The test prototype is usually a lot more expensive than the finished product because everything is tailor made just for this and noone has any experience with it yet. And then if problems occur you have to restart in the design phase again. So the total bill is completely unpredictable. If you set a certain budget limit there is a chance you get no finished design at all. Though for the F35 the 400 billion include the actual planes too, not only the developement.
Various tricks. So hard disk drives store memory magnetically. Its a disk with an "arm" where the disk spins, the arm itself is able to magnetize small sections of this magnetic disk. Originally the goal was to mainly make these magnetized chunks smaller and smaller. The smaller they are, the more we can cram onto a metal disk, this entailed making the devices more precise and using different materials to make the magnetic part not "spread" as much. One interesting example of this is something called "perpendicular recording." Back in the day magnetic data was recorded longitudinally on the magnetic disk as in north and south were on the surface of the disk, this turned out to require a lot more space on the surface. We instead switched to recording "perpendicularly," such that you can think of a bar magnet going "into the disk," This turned out to be somewhat difficult to do but it involved having a layer below the surface of the disk that would "pull" the magnetic field lines into it so that it the magnetic field goes deeper into the disk. This improved density by a few times.  Then we started cramming many disks into the disk containers. Modern hard disks contain a number of platters, each can be written on both sides.  We are finally running into the limits recently so there has been a big trend recently of so called shingled magnetic recording, or SMR. The problem is we can read the small magnetized bits better than we can write them. So what SMR does is have the bits so crammed together that we often overwrite much of the bit next to it. SMR saves that bit that is mostly overwritten then comes back on the next turn for another pass to "refresh it" kind of write in the middle between the two bits to fix it and make the nearby bits more readable, kind of like how the shingles on a roof cover part of the lower shingle. SMRs have kind of got a bad rep for having slow writes because it has to do multiple passes like this. Whether this is justified or not  We are frankly getting to the limits of disk drives but we aren't out of tricks quite yet. The current thing is something called heat assisted magnetic recording. It turns out that metals better preserve magnetic properties if they are exposed to a magnetic field while being cooled down. The goal is to use a laser to heat a small piece of platter, then magnetically write to it while it cools, decreasing the size of the bit that has to be magnetized. Beyond that, we still have a bit we can squeeze out of each disk. Magnetism in metals usually happens in "grains," metal crystals that all are arranged the same way. All ferrous metals like iron have their grains magnetized but in most non-magnets this doesn't occur in one direction (in fact this is why heat is able to make permenant magnets as described above, heat allows for the grains to move around a bit more and thus align all their grains in one direction). Current technologies have a couple dozen grains per bit, the next step will likely be using something called "patterned media," using our material sciences knowledge to change the randomly made crystals here to something more convenient and dense for recording.
Consoles aren't sold with high profit margins. The manufacturers make their money across the whole ecosystem of the console so it's in their best interests to make the barrier for entry as low as possible.
Who "we"? You, an user? Normally you wouldn't need to care. If you want to find out it'd depend on what program you're dealing with, it might have some way to find out. Or you might make an indirect conclusion by things like "What do the specs say?" and "Is it playing too slowly?" The computer? The software will run some sort of check to determine whether there's a video card or something else capable of decoding the particular type of file being shown.
The GNU/Linux family of operating systems forms the backbone of most of the internet, so knowing more about it can only help. I would suggest going Linux-network-security.
GPU chips are not actually that big, an RTX 3090 is less than 630 square millimeters. Memory modules are quite small as well, and power conditioning circuitry can be made quite compact. What takes up the bulk of the space is the coolers, the heat pipes, fin stacks, and fans to keep the GPU cool. Laptop GPUs might have the same chips as desktop cards but they don't have the cooling capacity and so do not perform as well. Generally speaking you can expect a full tier of downgrade in a mobile dedicated GPU, so a laptop 3080 will perform like a desktop 3070, etc.
As a programmer, not really. It's all kinds of weird and quirky, but it's not really technically challenging. 3D graphics is just a bunch of data. There's no reason why you can't encode 3D graphics in a text format, and in fact we do. For instance the STL format often used in 3D printing has a text representation that looks like:          solid model     facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0     outer loop     vertex 20.0 0.0 0.0     vertex 0.0 -20.0 0.0     vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0     endloop     endfacet     ... We can also do with images. The PNM format is obscure these days, but you can find the rare use in Linux systems. Looks like this:     P1     # This is an example bitmap of the letter "J"     6 10     0 0 0 0 1 0     0 0 0 0 1 0     0 0 0 0 1 0     0 0 0 0 1 0     0 0 0 0 1 0     0 0 0 0 1 0     1 0 0 0 1 0     0 1 1 1 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 0      If you save that as "j.pnm", you should be able to view it in a program that can read the format. It's just long and verbose, but other than that there's nothing difficult about expressing 3D data in text. And sure, you can combine different kinds of data in one file, and have markup indicating what part is what. HTML is an example of that kind of thing. In the end, data is data. It can be stored and transmitted in any conceivable manner: as dots on a piece of paper, as words, engraved into stone, sent into the air as smoke signals... it's just a matter of what method works best for a given application.
Deleting a file gives the computer permission to write to that space; the data only disappears once it’s been written over.
They are built in the desert, specifically in the Pheonix area because the exterior temperature has little to do with the temperature inside the data center. A data center uses a stupid amount of electricity and a huge portion of that electricity is released into the data center air as heat which has to be removed regardless of location. A desert has dry air (arid) which makes it easier to remove heat from a building.  As for the dust, that is controlled by the building 'envelope' and filters.  https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/12/data-centers-desert-technology-cio-network-data-centers.html?sh=323e5fdb77e2
TV remotes use infrared. There's an infrared LED on the remote, it blinks with a code that is seen by a sensor on he TV.  so it's like flashing a flashlight in morse code, except it's not morse code and the light is invisible to the human eye.
Budget usually is a major factor in this. For organisations with legacy software, it’s not just a matter of upgrading the OS. They have to have someone upgrade their mission critical software. That costs in development, testing, redeveloping, retesting, and then (here’s the killer) retraining the staff. Those costs begin to skyrocket.  Aside from this, preference. It’s what is often called Legacy Syndrome. People like what they know and they’re resistant to the unknown.
Every standard USB port provided 5 volts direct current unless both the charger and device support and can negotiate anything higher.
I'm assuming you mean what did people use before computer spreadsheets? Pen, paper and the ability to add (or a calculator).
Classical Logic assumes that something can only ever be true (1) or false (0), nothing in between. Fuzzy Logic differs in that regard and allows truth values to assume any value between 0 and 1. A typical motivating example is temperature, e.g. "Is the water hot?" Answering this in classical logic requires you to specify a specific but ultimately arbitrary cut-off point between what's considered hot and not-hot. With fuzzy logic you can instead define a transitional (fuzzy) area between hot and not-hot, where the truth value gradually moves from 1 to 0 as you lower the temperature, as opposed to the sudden jump in classical logic.
Basically you spell out things phonetically and the phone transforms groups of latin characters into a single mandarin character.
-you press power. - Cpu loads the BIOS from the ROM in the motherboard, - Bios Performs its POST check and initializes basic hardware(Memory, storage, graphics, input) - Bios searches for a bootable Partition in Storage by looking for a MBR(Master boot record) - if found:BIOS passes over control to the OS by a process called Bootstrapping - if not found: boot up stops there.
Well they do, at least ones that use an instance system for things like dungeons (ala World of Warcraft).  You may also run into load times if you move significantly farther/faster than you normally are able too or the server has a stumble and needs to catch up. But otherwise, the whole game world exists at once on a big server.  This server has about as much in common with your desktop PC as a 18 Wheeler truck has with a Toyota Camry. They are both vehicles, but one is a fair bit more powerful.   So the big server maintains the whole game world, and communicates with the client (player) side.  So every interaction you make (say, telling your character to run forward) is essentially your computer saying "Hey my guy is moving forward" to the big server which then replies "okay here's the animation of that, plus all the stuff you can see, any monsters, any players and whatever else is there."  This dialogue is continuous and the result is that the Client only has to request from the big server the stuff that is immediately near you.  So long as that dialogue can update your position and information faster than you can move through the world you never have to load more of the world that the bubble you can actually see.  Thus no need for a load screen, because it is a continuous load of information near you rather than the entire game world.
In theory this is possible. What you're describing is essentially decompiling software compiled for one architecture, and recompiling it for a different architecture. The main issue here is that writing such a "recompiler" is extremely hard. Decompiling is already a pretty shaky process that often results in very questionable source code that is near impossible to understand (despite being technically "human readable") and sometimes has a few unexpected errors when recompiled as the computer starts to get confused working with this pretty washed code. Trying to then adapt this code to new architectures and trying to guess what each code maps to is not a trivial task at all.  In some cases you'd simply collide with modern architectures not allowing things that older architectures did. Certain games on older consoles did a lot of *really* shaky things for optimization sake, like writing and reading from "off-limit" memory to increase their own memory space or relying on very specific hardware quirks (not architecture quirks, quirks in the literal hardware) that are either impossible to do or will get a resounding "no, forbidden" from the target OS.
Hi :-)  Drives basically have an "index" to where files are. Deleting data would require time and "wears out" the drive. By deleting, you just cross a file off that index and allow for the space to be used again later.  But the files are still there for the time being. If you store new data, it will eventually write over those sections.  Same with **damaged** drives. There might just be *some* sections that do not work (including the "index", meaning the computer won't show you any files), while other parts still work. If the data has not been overwritten (or damaged), you can still recover the files.  The program will just read everything and restore what's still valid file data. Kind of like if you rip out the first few pages of a book. You just have to browse through all pages to find where a chapter starts and make a new index. (EDITED, hit sent to soon, sorry :-))
Crypto miners are creating a significantly higher demand than what is expected or even reasonable. Add in current supply chain issues and the problem gets even worst. Basically in order to mine bitcoins you basically need to brute force a ton of calculations. GPUs are made to do just that as graphic calculations are simple calculations that need to be done in bulk. This means Crypto miners buy dozens of GPUs at once expecting to make back the cost once they actually get mining. As Crypto prices continue to inflate the GPU market is going to get more unreasonable as secondary retailers start picking up.
They'd come up with a story.  Design the main character.  Design the world. Design the cultures.  Etc, etc, etc.  All of this most likely before any programming. A game engine will either be chosen or created from scrap.  An engine has all the basic elements you need already programmed such as gravity, light, the ability to place assets and scripts into the game, etc. They'd then make the actual overall world.  Individual assets like buildings, trees, animals, monsters, etc can then be made and placed into it.  Indoor areas like inside buildings, dungeons, etc might be separate load areas.  Scripts will be written to control how these work. Triggering events will be placed in the world.  A trigger is something that when activated results in something occuring, such as the character reaching a certain location may then activate a boss monster to appear.   Along the way they're play testing it to make sure it works, redesigning the story to either remove elements, add elements or modify elements and tweaking animals, NPCs, monsters, and all of their scripts, etc.   And then they release a buggy mess that probably takes like 10 patches to fix.
There's not really any difference a program and an application. Apple called the programs on the iPhone "apps", and the rest is history.
Dual and quad channel. Dual channel means the CPU and motherboard can use two sticks at once, doubling the performance. This means the performance of the memory, mind you, not of the entire system. In modern times you have quad channel which is the same sort of thing -- the board and CPU can talk to all 4 RAM sticks at once. Which means that a configuration of say, one 32 GB stick will be slower than 8+8+8+8. In practice though the performance difference isn't as huge as it sounds, because from the point of view of a CPU, RAM is very slow, and the CPU uses its own internal cache whenever it can. This means the speed of RAM only matters when the CPU doesn't have what it needs on hand. This means that 4X faster memory might actually translate to a 10-20% real performance difference. Still, if your board has support for it, lower size RAM sticks are cheaper, and you don't see the need to add more in the future, there's really no reason not to do it. A small performance benefit is better than none in any case. If you look for benchmarks you may find some very confusing results -- some games don't care about dual/quad channel at all, some have huge performance differences. That's because different games use memory differently. A small, lightweight game probably won't benefit much. A game that pushes the limits and uses lots of RAM will probably benefit quite noticeably though.
The business of manufacturing chips is a lot like printing with a separation between designers and printers. Companies like AMD don't actually make chips, they only design them. The actual manufacturing is done by companies called [foundries][1]. Foundries have different facilities with different capabilities. When they offer their services, they say, "we can make chips with the transistors X nanometers long, with Y transistors on a chip, and Z many layers of wires, etc." This is similar to a printing company offering "300dpi, full color, glossy prints." This complete specification of what they are capable of is called a [node][2]. By convention nodes are named after the nominal size of a single gate on the chip, e.g. 5nm or 3nm. (Many other specifications are part of the technology node, but gate size is by far the most important so it forms a convenient shorthand.)  Smaller is better because the smaller the gate, the more you can stuff on a chip, the lower the power draw, and the faster the clock cycle. 3nm is *very* cutting edge. I think current generation chips are mostly between 4nm and 7nm. So what they are saying is that AMD is planning to partner with a foundry to produce their next generation of chips with very small gates. This is signaling an aggressive and somewhat risky business strategy as it could take a few years to work the kinks out of the 3nm process. Not many foundries will even being tooled-up for it, so you could run into supply issues as well. But I'm sure AMD knows what they're doing and it's not crazy, just slightly more aggressive than say, Intel, who are planning to still be on 4nm through 2022 the last I heard.

I read the Wikipedia for "horseshoe" a while back cuz i was wondering why horses need them, and if i remember right, wild horses don't need them because they walk very long distances all the time so their hooves naturally harden in the perfect way evolution meant them to. Domestic horses however don't walk as much, or do so for shorter distances, or they gallop which i think isn't good for the development of the hooves. Also there's something about the ground being softer in europe/north America, than in wherever wild horses are native to, which again hurts the development of hooves. Its very similar to human teeth. There are people in Africa for example who still live like everybody did thousands of years ago, including the fact that they don't cook meat. These guys have perfectly straight teeth, and its because the tough chewing grows their jawbone and the muscles in their mouth such that the teeth can fit and come out as evolution meant them to. Here in the "developed" world our lifestyle is so docile that our jaw can't fit our teeth and so most people have either had retainers or just live with crooked teeth
Same reason you don’t have to worry about losing a file if you save it, log off the program, and put your computer in sleep mode versus someone ripping the power cord out of the wall while you’re in the middle of creating a word doc. One is abrupt cessation of all functions regardless of consequence and the other is a deliberate program to tuck everything away and consume less energy while its main functions aren’t in use.
The cute response is a biologically evolved mechanism, as is our disgust response. We can identify with many mammals which depend on their mothers (like we do), and so we often see shared characteristics between them and our children. As for bugs, we've learned the hard way (and it is hardwired into our genetics) that things with claws, bright colors, unfamiliar shapes, etc. are dangerous. There's a very good reason that the top 3 fears are fear of heights, fear of snakes, and fear of insects/spiders.
Your ears have a complex shape, which allows the "left/right" process to work in other directions.  It's not as good, but it's better than nothing.
Those were trans men who were biologically women. 'Biological men' (XY chromosomes) cannot give birth to children.
>ELI5: What happens to someone's body when they indicate they want to donate their whole body to science after they die? I'm not talking about organ donation to the living.      Aspiring physicians get to dissect them. It's not usually a good idea to let first-timer medical students practice on the living - so they get corpses for that purpose. Those corpses come from donations.
No, the tourniquet isnt tied that tight. It only slows the flow to make the vein a bit enlarged. It should also be removed as soon as blood is flowing into the first collection tube. There are also deeper veins/arteries that are less affected than the surface ones.
They don't "know" anything. They're just chemicals that your body needs in small amounts for certain processes. They get absorbed directly into the bloodstream as food is broken down during digestion. When a cell needs things for cellular functions, it takes some from the blood supply.
It’s related to empathy. There was a study where the higher one’s empathy was, the more the mirroring yawning was. Not everyone mirrors yawning. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29771564/
I think it goes like this: When your body becomes cold, the blood flows toward your inner core to keep yourself warm, resulting in less blood flow to the outer parts of your body, making it harder to move your arms and legs, and your skin becomes more rigid and more pressure is on your nerves.
In general no, it requires a set amount of energy (calories) to do the same amount of work. In fact, work and energy as physical quantities have the same measurement unit (it’s Joule). However, it is possible that training will make your body more efficient at doing work, so there may be less energy wasted (like on needless movements, or panting etc.) and thus less energy spent overall. But being exhausted does not necessarily mean you’ve done more work.
Water flows across the relatively large, highly-folded surface of the gills. Just under the delicate surface are lots of blood-filled capillaries. The blood absorbs oxygen from the water. In all but icefish this process is aided by hemoglobin in the blood, which binds oxygen and carries it in the blood stream. Carbon dioxide also passes out of the blood through the thin surface of the gills. The delicate surface of the gills is possible because the surrounding water provides support. Icefish evolved a blood system without hemoglobin, perhaps as a means of iron conservation. They make up for the lack with larger blood vessels and hearts and more blood. They also live in cold, well-mixed, oxygen-rich waters of the Southern Ocean, and they live a somewhat sluggish life, remaining still for long periods before ambushing their prey.
There will probably be some difference. But most people don't notice or control the context well so the experience tends to be rather unclear. Sugary alcohol is easy to drink. This is why it is generally easier to get very quickly drunk on them.  Drinks that are extremely sour or strong tasting tends to be sipped slower and therefore might feel different. Food consumption definitely affects the rate of alcohol absorption. Drinks consumed after meals or with lots of snacks probably take longer to show effects. So if you're downing some beers while eating buffalo chicken wings and potato skins, the alcohol will probably take longer to affect you.
Your brain is still aware of the things going on around you which is why your sleep is not as high quality when you sleep somewhere new like a hotel. So no you’re not entirely unaware of the world while asleep. Your brain actually sends a variety of signals to the rest of your body which causes your heart rate and breathing to slow. The core temperature of the body needs to be lowered by two degrees as well which is why you’ll find it easier to fall asleep in a room that’s too cold as opposed to one that’s too hot. If you’re interested in a more in depth answer look up Matthew Walker he’s an expert.
Horses can't lie down for long periods of time due to the shape of their torsos. So if they break a leg, many of them would die slow painful deaths alternating between struggling to stand on their broken leg and suffocating from laying down too long, so it is generally more humane to just euthanize them. That being said, in some cases horses can be supported in a harness while they heal, but this isn't always successful.
Life is like inertia (what is on motion will stay in motion until something acts upon it) our brains and bodies tend to like to stay where we are. It’s harder to wake up after sleeping and it’s hard to get out of an emotion you are in.  So when I’m in a bad place I try to do something that breaks the inertia. A good nights sleep, a cold glass of water, it can be anything really.
Seagulls drink both fresh and salt water.  Here’s a bit about the saltwater intake:  *The amount of sea water a gull can drink would be the equivalent of two gallons to a man; but to a man, one-tenth of this amount would cause collapse through dehydration of the tissues.* *The secret of the gull's ability to survive drinking salt water lies in a pair of glands in the head, but their function was not eluciadated until a few years ago. Each gland consists of thousands of minute tubes arranged like the bristles on a bottle brush. Where the handle of the brush would be is a central tube communicating with the nasal cavity. A rich supply of fine blood vessels surrounds the gland, which extracts the salt from the blood.* *The salt is then lost in water, drops from the tip of the beak, each drop many times more salty than tears, five times as salty as the gull's own blood and twice as salty as sea water.* Here’s a [bit more about seagulls.](https://onekindplanet.org/animal/seagull/)
We didn't develop the uncanny valley as a phenomenon, but we did develop it as a concept. The phenomenon it describes is that we're okay with artificial constructs (e.g. robots or animations) that don't convincingly mimic humans at all, and we're also okay when they are incredibly convincing (or when looking at a real human). But somewhere in the middle is a zone of things that look and behave somewhat like humans, but not quite, and that we find very unsettling. There are various hypotheses for why this happens, and there is also some disagreement about what exactly the uncanny valley is. Is it one thing, or really a collection of multiple distinct but overlapping phenomena? And is there really a distinct "valley", or are people somewhat unsettled by any attempt to mimic human beings? My two cents is that it arises in the intermediate zone because, when something is not at all convincingly human-like, then at a basic perceptual level we don't really recognize it as human, even though intellectually we recognize it as a representation of something humanoid. An extreme example would be a stick figure. We understand that this is a drawing that represents a person, but perceptually we don't actually think that it *is* a person. And so we aren't disturbed if the stick figure doesn't quite behave or look like a real human. But then, as you make your human likeness more realistic (e.g. better-looking androids or 3D renders), at some point your brain goes "hey, that's a human". Only, this human isn't quite right. Its movements are stunted or anatomically incorrect. Or there's something not quite accurate about the appearance of the eyes. So your perceptual interpretation is: this is a human who has something very strange wrong with them. Not dissimilar to an animated corpse. And that's why we're so unsettled. The thing starts to become monstrous because our brain's automatic interpretation is "fucked up human being" rather than "just a representation of a human". To get out of the uncanny valley, you need to make your human simulacrum so life-like that real humans cannot detect that there is anything non-human about it. We're already starting to succeed at this in limited ways. Especially for static pictures, it's already possible to render realistic human faces and bodies that are indistinguishable from the real deal and therefore not in the uncanny valley. Once you introduce motion, it's much harder to get it exactly right because now you have all these extra degrees of freedom. It's especially hard to mimic all the little movements that we make unconsciously, and so animations or robot imitations of humans often appear too still, making only deliberate, larger movements. But at the same time, you have probably already watched a movie where in some shots, human actors were entirely digitally replaced, and you didn't notice. It doesn't always work, but it's starting to work at least some of the time (especially when it doesn't involve having to accurately mimic the human face in close-up range).
Because a semi-permeable membrane like that is a two-way street. If you can absorb water easily, you'll be able to lose water easily. And since we don't live in an aquatic environment, we'd be losing water all the time.
So, your protein's primary sequence is the amino acids. So the DNA codes for RNA which codes for an AA sequence. But that's not all there is to proteins, there are things called post-translational modifications which happen to proteins. This will modify the protein by adding on sugars, cutting off sections, creating cross-links, sulphonating Tyrosines and others. If you were to take some of your DNA for a single gene and put it in a different organism, the post-translational modifications would be different, so it would end up being slightly different. To make it completely the same, you'd need to change a huge amount of DNA. Other parts of your body which aren't made of protein are created by enzymes. So you have proteins which act as chemical reactors and cause certain chemical reactions to happen, creating other chemicals which make up your body. These enzymes are ultimately encoded by your DNA, though. You also have things which you cannot make which make up your body. Vitamin D is created by sunlight when it's source chemical is in your skin. Vitamin C cannot be made by humans any longer, as our common ancestor with other primates lost the gene to make it. So we need to eat it.  Metals like Iron, Calcium, Sodium and Potassium are also critical to the functioning of your body. You can't make these from DNA, you can only consume them! You also have things which you can't make from scratch with DNA, only expand and divide. So your outer cell membrane can't be created from DNA alone, you need to have a cell membrane already! Then you can add to it and then the cells can divide. But you don't have any gene which lets you create a cell membrane from scratch. The same applies to the mitochondria which live inside your cell. They have their own DNA and a double-cell membrane. You can't create those from scratch either.
Well...yes of course. The body eventually dies, no matter how much support is at hand. We don't have the ability to replace *every* organ in the body, and some diseases cannot be cured through either a new organ or new blood. Could you be a little clearer on your question?
Nothing to sweat about. Also don't worry about the alkaline water nonsense either. Glad you're staying hydrated
So your body wants to conserve heat.  When it's cold is does this by not sending as much blood to things that aren't 100% needed in that moment.  This is because blood near the skin will lose heat faster than blood inside your core. However, your head has a lot of important organs in it.  Your brain, your eyes and these always need a good supply of blood.  Your arms, fingers, ears, etc don't need a constantly supply of blood when it's cold.
No, you'd get less energy out of eating a live animal. Cooking actually allows us to get more energy out of out food by making it easier to digest.
I'm 99.999 percent certain that their electric abilities are under totally voluntary control. The only reason I have any doubt is, like, what if they lost control of those muscles while they were mating. Because eelgasm. But I doubt that happens.
Rape and sexually motivated murders aren't about lust or sex. They're about control. The killer enjoys the feeling of having absolute power over someone else, controlling their movement, manipulating their emotions, and causing someone else to feel fear.  Killing the victim is the pinnacle of that, playing god and having the ultimate power over someone else, deciding if their victim will live or die, and how they will die. They want their victim to feel utterly powerless, dying knowing that they are subservient to the killer, less than human. The types of people who commit rape and this kind of murder are selfish narcissists. Their will and desires are the only ones that matter. Everyone else exists to please them, and to bow to their will. They really can't understand any one else's having free will to deny them what they want. Watching porn gives them a chance to fantasize. In their minds, they are the strong figure who others lust after. Porn reinforces the idea, in their minds, that they are in control, and that if they want sex, all they have to do is take it. I'm not saying porn is bad! Porn is like alcohol. For the mentally healthy person, it can be a wonderful release. For the mentally unhealthy, it's like giving alcohol to a violent alcoholic.
Seems unsettled but here’s a theory: “The most recent hypothesis suggests that the hair loss process begins during puberty, when growth of the skull and the muscles in the forehead and neck increases the tension in a tight band of tissue stretching over the top of the head. The more DHT (a type of testosterone) there is, the more these muscles contract, which causes inflammation and brings in more DHT. Over time, the DHT thickens the band of tissue, restricting the supply of blood and nutrients to the hair follicles above it. The follicles on top of the head get smaller and eventually disappear, while those on the sides of the head remain largely unaffected.” Source https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-do-men-go-bald-from-the-top-of-their-heads/
A few reasons: \-Almost every heart surgery, including minimally invasive ones, involves little air bubbles entering the body's circulation.  These microbubbles could reach the brain and embolize.  Usually, the end result is clinically insignificant, but it could certainly play a role in post-operative memory loss. \-The cardiopulmonary bypass machine used in open heart surgery causes a profound inflammatory response on your body, which could contribute to post-operative cognitive dysfunction.  Also, surgery in general causes an inflammatory response. \-General anesthesia could also play a role, although the relationship isn't completely clear.  Different kinds of anesthesia (intravenous vs. inhalational, general vs. regional, etc) have all been compared and to date, there haven't been any studies that show a conclusive difference in post-operative cognition, surprisingly. \-Many people who undergo cardiac surgery are older and have pre-existing health and cognitive issues that may predispose them to developing cognitive dysfunction and memory loss after surgery. Hope this helps. Source: I'm a cardiac anesthesiologist. EDIT: hey folks, lots of anesthesia-related questions!  Looks like the thread has been locked, so I can no longer reply to each comment, but feel free to DM me for anything.  My schedule is unpredictable, but I'll do my best to get back to each question. Just some general advice regarding the topic: there isn't any conclusive evidence that general anesthesia causes long-term cognitive issues.  It's something that's currently being researched and there are obviously a lot of factors that affect why some people develop post-operative cognitive dysfunction.  Many people have asked questions on behalf of themselves or a child that has undergone open heart surgery and expressed concern about cognitive issues.  It's not an easy thing to diagnose over the internet and again, there are a lot variables at play here.  The research on the subject hasn't been conclusive either.  So, if you or your child had surgery in the past, and are concerned about cognitive dysfunction or neurodevelopment issues, please make an appointment with a neurologist or pediatric neurologist to help further assist you. One last bit of advice: all surgery, especially open heart surgery, has risks.  It's perfectly normal to be nervous about surgery and anesthesia, but please don't let the fear overwhelm you!  Medical technology has come a long way since the days of ether and unwashed hands.  Obviously, surgical outcomes are greatly affected by the type of surgery and the degree of patient comorbidities, but we do everything we can in the OR to treat problems as soon as they arise and prevent any serious issues from happening. I appreciate all the kind words.  It can be a grueling job sometimes, but I genuinely love what I do.  But every successful heart surgery is a massive team effort, consisting of anesthesiologists, nurses, perfusionists and of course surgeons, not to mention the cardiologists and intensivists treating the patient before and after the surgery, so I can't take too much credit!
Because we're reacting in a way to initiate either the fight or flight reflex and based on the fact that humans aren't very capable hunters/fighters when they are alone the flight reflex is the most common response so we jump to prepare to flee. Now our jumps are very minor compared to other creatures. Imagine a cat if you scare it it jumps back a good foot or two humans currently being the alpha predator of the world don't have to be afraid and we are losing our conditioning for that but we will never lose our natural response
Part of it's simply tolerances built up through drug use, but in terms of musicians, muscle memory also has a big part to play. I'm a (lapsed) guitarist and my drug of choice was booze and weed. This was years ago mind, but when I played in bands wasted, my fingers could remember the songs better than my brain could remember how to speak. That said, anyone who plays completely wasted will have a regular on stage car crash. Bands can be very good at covering it up. I used to forget to play Solo's quite often because I was wasted in the zone and missed my queue. We didn't play covers, so the audience didn't realise. If you read Slash's autobiography, he managed to be mostly fine on scandalous amounts of class A's but still had his car crash moments. Then there were musicians like Steven Adler who got sacked because they simply couldn't perform wasted and couldn't kick the drugs. Look up Led Zeppelin's atrocious performance at Live Aid for a real life drugs car crash. Musicians don't get away with it as much as you think, but tolerance and muscle memory combined with working being wasted into the performance can cover up a lot.
Similar, but not really the same. Smelling something means that enough of it is reaching your olfactory center up in your nose to set off the nerves in there, which relay the smell to your brain. Inhaling something usually implies that that something is reaching your lungs. So you could inhale something through your nose and smell it. But you could also inhale something through your mouth and not smell it. For smell soemthing, it has enter your nose at a minimum. And if you are smelling it, chances are it also also probably being inhaled to your lungs, but that isn’t 110% guaranteed.
Your throat splits into two pipes. The trachea leads to your lungs and your esophagus leads to your stomach.  There's a valve over your trachea to stop food and drink from entering your lungs (it's called the epiglottis). Sometimes food gets past your epiglottis and touches your larynx (voice box). You immediately start to cough because your body doesn't want food or drink entering the lungs. It hurts so you know that something is wrong.
Having too much dopamine *chronically*, or surges of dopamine without reason, are bad things. Momentary bursts of dopamine are necessary for many things including the pleasurable sensations we feel when listening to music, but the dopamine is eventually broken down by enzymes and removed.
The oil amount in fast foods usualy is the reason for stomach not liking the food after its digested
Brain games are just puzzle games meant to exercise your mind more than other games which rely on reflexes or muscle memory. AFAIK studies have at best shown short-term improvement in some cognitive functions, but no evidence of long-term benefit.
I think the thorns are there to protect the plant and not the berries. If it wasn’t thorny, things would try to eat it and not it’s berries. It “wants” things to eat the berries as that’s how it disperses it’s seeds and not eat the plant itself.

Lice and chicken pox don't just spontaneously appear once a group of kids hits critical mass. All it takes is one kid bringing it in, and it spreads around to the group very quickly. They're both just highly communicable and contagious.
Drugs are substances that are chemically similar to stuff our body uses for internal communication. Morphines for example are similar to endorphines (hence the name, endo=inner) If you take the drug the job of that internal substance gets done way too much. But your body isn't dumb. It knows thats too much, so it stops producing that internal chemical on its own when you supply way too much from the outside. The receptors also get more resistant from the constant firing, wich is why you build a tolerance. Now if you stop doing the drug the exact opposite happens. Now there isn't enough of that chemical in your body, and it takes a while for your body to readjust. And thats pretty dangerous, as these chemicals control basically everything your body does, including bloodpressure, breathing, emotions, ...
The egg. Many eggs were laid before anything even vaguely chickenlike existed. This answer is a bit of a cop-out tho. Let us set some ground rules. A "chicken egg" is an egg that will hatch into a chicken. This contains all of the DNA of a chicken. A "chicken" is, well, a chicken. The genetic equivalent to that which you might find in a farm. A "proto-chicken" is the creature that came immediately before the chicken, but is sufficiently genetically different that it is not a chicken itself. So, when an animal reproduces, its genes get shuffled around a bit to produce its offspring. When a chicken (or proto-chicken) reproduces, this is the step that results in the egg. Thus, the proto-chicken laid an egg genetically identical to the first chicken. This egg is a "chicken egg". The egg came first. If we instead call a "chicken egg" any egg laid by a chicken, then the egg in my example would not count, and so the first chicken is born before a chicken egg is produced. The chicken came first. I'd tend to favor the first definition, but I suppose you can choose either.
Your butthole actually has similar receptors as your mouth and tongue, as well as the one that detects spicy. The capsaicin that makes things spicy is waxy, so it sticks to things it touches and is hard to get off. It's also not easily digestible, so some of it will pass all the way through and get stuck on your butthole when you poop. Since your butthole has the spicy receptor, it burns!
Psychology is the big category for science about the brain and mind. Psychologists are people who study or apply the science of psychology. Clinical psychologists are the people patients see and talk through their problems with. Psychiatry is a related science that applies the field of medicine to the field of psychology. Psychiatrists can prescribe drugs and other medical procedures to their patients; clinical psychologists cannot. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists often work together to help their patients.
In short no. So sleep is not one big chunk. It is rather like a series or cycle of smaller things. Sleep progresses through stages so you normally go into initial sleep which is just a restorative state where you can wake pretty easily. Then comes light sleep where your body actively starts resting followed by deep sleep and then REM. After REM you cycle back to light then deep etc until you wake up. On average each cycle takes about 90 minutes So when you sleep, you are stacking cycles not a whole block of sleep.  Some people sleep one block per night(normal 8 hours although sleep amounts vary from about 6 which is seen as a sort of min to 10 or 12hrs), others sleep a four hour block then awake for a while then sleep again then awake for the day. Sleep is not bankable BUT being rested means when you need to push hard, it is easier to prolong wakefullness whereas when you are chronically tired , you struggle to keep pushing. It is also very important to stick to a sleep schedule, even on weekends. It is also possible to support lack of sleep with naps. Nasa conducted a study on pilots and found that even with a full nights rest, having a micro nap of 5 to 10 min boosted alertness and response times afterwards. Why does caffeine not work? Your body secretes a hormone to make you feel tired as a signal that you need rest. Caffiene and this hormone plugs into the same receptor in the brain(imagine 8 usb drives trying to plug into 3 available slots). At a certain point, your body needs rest to clear and restore the hormone imbalance. This is why coffee naps work.
Your skin is protected by a layer of oil that you produce.  When you wash the skin, especially with hot soapy water you remove this protective layer or oil.  This then allows your skin to dry out more easily than if the protective layer was there.
Imagine making a copy of a document with a scanner. Every time you scan a scanned document to make a copy it gets degraded. That's what's happening in your cells, a scanned copy of a scanned copy of a scanned copy.  Now your body is doing that every few days or weeks depending on they type of cell. After 100+ years, it just gets degraded to the point where your organs start to fail.  That's also how we get cancer, if you get a smudge on one of the photocopies and can't read it anymore, then keep photocopying it.
Because the carrot is 'feeding' from the green leaves. It's taking out the nutrients and the water left in the green part. This is why you see 'beheaded' carrots actually perish faster than the ones with the leaves.
You can only taste, with your tongue, a very small number of flavours.  Like half a dozen. What you think of as taste is actually almost entirely smell.  We can detect millions of different smells.  When you have a stuffed nose you can't smell properly and so food "tastes" bland.
Like you have correctly mentioned, those are basic physiological instincts that do not require any conscious thinking.  They are more like heart pumping blood or breathing.  Otherwise they would die out so quickly
For the same reason you're not as salty as the food you eat. Their bodies filter salt out of the food and water they take in and they pee it out. Fish's bodies are better at it than yours, however, which is why they can drink saltwater indefinitely and you can't.
Water *boils* at 100 degrees, but can evaporate at any temperature. The temperature measures the *average* kinetic of the water molecules, but some of them naturally move faster than others, so they can break free and evaporate.
Evolutionary/genetically speaking, wider hips and bigger butts means better baby-making abilities. Male biology wants to continue the genetic line. Thus, males are attracted to bigger booties
You know how when you’re extremely hungry and all you can think about is food? You get angry and your judgment gets all out of wack... you’ll make terrible decisions on what you are willing to eat when you’re starving... but as soon as you fill your belly you feel better and no longer think about food... you also regret eating that disgusting garbage called fast food and you tell yourself never again.... but after a little you’re back at it again.
Short answer: It's fiction and looks cool. Longer answer: The fluid gives the appearance of suspending the body, meaning there are no pressure points to stress injuries further, would help regulate temperature, and possibly deliver healing chemicals to external wounds. It also has a passing resemblance to the womb, which is where we are taken care of when at our most vulnerable before birth. But ultimately it's purely a sci-fi construct so it's all for show, and not based in reality. The creators figured that being submerged in a tank looked like the most rigorous intensive care, so they went with it.
It’s called an internal monologue and not everyone experiences it as a voice in their head. How often one experiences this voice going on in their head varies amongst the population that has it as well. Overall, it’s the mind’s way of aiding in decision making and taking in new information
OK. You know sugars?  Glucose, sucrose, etc?  A carb is basically several of those, chemically linked into one big starch molecule. Digestion breaks the carbs back down into simple sugars, so your body can use them as a quick source of energy. People on a low-carb diet are making sure the body doesn’t have a lot of those sugars, so it has to fall back on burning fats (which takes more energy).
The Dutch bred them to be orange in honour of their king, William of Orange. the wild carrot is purple. When messing around with it a yellow one appeared which was then further selectively bred until orange appeared.
Your muscles need more blood when you work out as they are working harder. Veins expand to allow the blood flow. The more you work out the bigger and more permanent the veins get. You can reduce it by not working out.
Bondage, domination, sado-masochism. Effectively, a set of kinks or fetishes about power and control. You find it erotic to tie someone up and control them, or to be the person being bound and controlled. There's a lot of range for this from just using a handcuff to make someone feel like they can't actually escape, to actually physically hurting them in a consensual manner in the bedroom.
If you're two years old, a year is half your life and it feels longer. If you're 10 years old, a year is a tenth of your life, a shorter duration. If you're 80 years old, a year is an 80th of your life, thus feeling much shorter. That's the running theory that I've heard.

The standard trans-inclusive answer is "yes", but a better one might be - what do you mean by your question? Like, if the answer is "yes" or the answer is "no", what does that tell you about the world? Is your question "is such a man more likely to date men in the future?", for example? In practice, most people aren't completely inflexibly 100% straight or 100% gay. A large proportion of self-identified 'straight' people have had some sexual experience with the same sex, for example. So it's not like if someone 'does something gay' then they're suddenly irrevocably attracted to one sex over the other. A straight man might be interested in a trans woman who hasn't had genital surgery because he sees her as a woman and is attracted to her on that basis, in which case it probably doesn't make him less likely to be straight in other contexts. Or he might be interested in her because of her genitals (even if many trans people would rather he weren't) and because he can rationalize that 'not being gay', in which case there's a good chance he isn't entirely straight and is in denial about that. Or a number of other possible motivations, none of which have anything to do with whether the interest is "technically gay" or whatever.
E. Coli or Escherichia Coli is a bacteria present in the intestines of warm blooded animals and normally represents no threat to humans. However some strains of E. Coli may produce Shiga toxins which can be a threat, good hygiene standards however can normally minimise the chances of contamination with E. Coli. https://youtu.be/jv_xh0GQs9E Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica are the two broad species of bacteria that can cause salmonellosis producing symptoms of diarrhoea, fever and vomiting. However basic cooking and cleanliness routines can prevent issues with the salmonella bacteria in food. https://youtu.be/05c0z4I345k
It’s a spontaneous autoimmune disease, so it just pops up randomly. It’s not entirely genetic. If anything, it’s a side effect (like all autoimmune diseases) of having an immune system that’s _too_ good at it’s job. So basically you have a kid, they waste away and die young, but you have other kids and your strong immune system survives. Eventually, something could trigger that system to attack the pancreas, and boom, another kid (or less frequently, adult) in your family line gets it. This continues until insulin is developed (_not_ by Banting) and childhood mortality starts to go down.
Saltwater has more salt dissolved in it so the ratio of salt to water is higher in saltwater than the ratio of salt to water in our body. Because the salt and water in our body needs to stay in a particular balance for our cells to function properly, drinking saltwater would disrupt this balance and cause problems

Your brain doesn’t know that the image on your retina is upside down, and it doesn’t need to know. Your brain has no idea what a retina even is. All it knows is that specific signals received from the optic nerve correspond to specific locations in your field of vision.
Skin cells - and other cells - secrete proteins and other substances around them that they sit in and support the cells. How it works is that its kind of like a jelly that holds water and acts like a mesh for the cells to sit in. It also lets cells move around - like white blood cells - to get to other places. It's present in a lot of places, not just the skin - bones, connective tissue, fat, blood, cartilage, and so on.  If you had a pot of spaghetti meatballs, that's what it kind of looks like under a microscope. The meatballs are the cells and the spaghetti is the extracellular matrix.
The article mentions the "minimal sense of self". That basically just means "I have thoughts on my own". People with a self-disorder have that reduced or disrupted. They have doubts their thoughts are their own. Someone with such a disorder could for example think they are being under mindcontrol. They feel their thoughts aren't made by themselves but injected from outside.  Or they doubt they (or their mind) exist in the first place.
Hydrogen and oxygen are incredibly common in our universe. They bond readily, forming a substance with remarkable properties; water. Water molecules are polar, and in its liquid state its polarity (as well as a knack for dissociation) allow it to dissolve almost anything. Salts, minerals, gases, acids. Take a chunk of potassium hydroxide and surround it in hydrogen chloride gas - not much interesting happens. Dissolve the two in water, allowing them to dissociate and mix on a molecular scale instead of only mixing at the surface of the solid, and you get a violent reaction. More generally, water allows chemistry to take place in solution - it allows things that would not mix together to mix together anyways. It also helps them to break apart, accelerating or enabling reactions.
While it wasn't an experiment with 2 identical individuals a similar thing did happen. A guy ate a diet exclusively consisting of junk food but ensured that his total calorie count never exceeded the daily recommended average. He ended up losing 11 pounds. Because junk food also is very calorie dense that meant that overall he didn't get to eat very much food.  https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-dec-06-la-he-fitness-twinkie-diet-20101206-story.html
GMOs are perceived as bad by the public for several reasons, most of them are bad. At its root, being against GMO is simply the consequence of being afraid of things one does not understand - gene editing technology and biotechnology in general are not easy concepts to understand. Most objections to GMOs are centered around variations of the argument that "anything that is unnatural is bad, and GMOs are unnatural." This is a fallacious argument because the goodness or badness of something has no relation to whether that thing appears in nature without human intervention or is created by humans. In general, people who do not understand how biotech works feel creeped out at the idea of editing genomes. And since lab grown meat does not involve editing genomes (or at least it doesn't have to), it doesn't get criticized in the same manner as GMOs do. Additionally, lab grown meat has benefits that are easier to understand compared to GMOs, especially since most people eat meat and understand the ethical and environmental issues with eating meat.
Reflexes are fast because they are an involuntary response that bypasses the conscious part of the brain. It's governed by the motor cortex, the part of the brain that handles motor functions. Making a conscious decision to duck away to dodge an incoming ball for instance takes time. You have to see the ball, understand what's happening, estimate the trajectory, decide whether to put your arms up or dodge it or do nothing and then actually do it. This takes way too long. Reflexes don't bother, your motor cortex just acts before you can even think about what's happening. This makes it way faster but can cause an involuntary reflex that isn't appropriate, like getting scared by someone just coming in for a hug and accidentally punching them in the face.
One theory is that humans killed them. Since they were huge targets that could sustain a lot of people for and good length of time. Granted the entire process of a species's extinction is way more complicated than an eli5 could ever get into. Elephants, giraffe, hippopotamus, bears, and lions are all classified as megafauna. So there is nothing stopping them from existing today.
For the vast, vast majority of humanity clean food, water and clothing were not a thing. So immune systems of the survivors were those that fought back hardest. Now we have hygiene. The immune system that evolved for dozens of small wars at once has no one to fight. But better to be extra cautious and react too much than too little. Those that die from it before reproducing will cause that flaw to be weeded out in a dozen millennia or so.
It's a psychological reason, not biological. Your brain has made some association between animal fats and revulsion somewhere along the line. Lots of people who love animals and don't want to hurt them make such associations. Others convince themselves that it's health issues. All sorts of different life experiences lead people towards various food compulsions.
Because implants just push areas out to make it appear bigger. Eg. Breast implants, bum implants, pectoral. Its just a cushion that sits under the skin.  The penis is an organ not just an area of skin. So even small alterations are going to impact usage. Rather than cushions, to elongate the penis, you'd need to extend the corpus cavernosum, the tissues that fill with blood creating an erection.  I believe there is a ligament that can be cut? A suspended  ligament that holds the penis closer to the belly. If that is surgically altered then the penis appears longer. Think opposite of a face/breast lift Edit: the replies are amazing! And funny! I learned much in this thread :)
It's not every illness, and some infections might cause pain in a specific area they are infecting. But in general, it's not the sickness, it's our immune response to the illness. When your immune system ramps it can trigger swelling, called inflammation, in the muscles and bones. Sometimes this swelling itself is uncomfortable and causes pain. In certain specific illnesses, like the flu, there is another cause from when the body is specifically locked in and targeting the flu virus particles. The body produces specific flu-fighting proteins, and our white blood cells send out specific "here's some flu!!" signal-chemicals. It just so happens those proteins and signal-chemicals irritate our joints, bones, and muscles as well, just a odd and shitty coincidence. Giving you the classic achy flu symptoms, again it's not the flu it's your own immune system causing it. Same reason why certain vaccines, like the flu vaccine, can trigger aches and fevers, because you're getting all the immune response with none of the infection.
The body generates heat that needs to get outside (like every other engine) and that only works when the surrounding is colder.
Oxygen is reactive while Nitrogen is fairly inert. That is, Oxygen more readily participates in a wider variety of chemical reactions, making it useful in storing, transporting, and extracting energy. Molecular nitrogen is fairly unreactive and therefore doesn't participate in many chemical reactions, so it can't be used for that purpose.
More or less. The more you perform an activity, the more active motor neurons your brain recruits, which are what fire when you're working out. Provided your nutrition is adequate, you'll build back over what breaks down, with the added benefit of muscle memory that helps the movement feel more natural and automatic (provided you maintain good form and don't injure yourself)
Pimples happen when the sebum glands below the surface of the skin get clogged and then bacteria cause an [infection](https://static.acne.org/ipb_uploads/monthly_2018_08/04-acne-formation.jpg.0092cd50a786443a87958a8de726b541.jpg). Your superglue may or may not have blocked the gland, but there was no bacteria, so no infection.
Psychadelic mushrooms contain the chemical psilosyben which is converted to psilosen in your gut. Psilosen binds to neurotransmitters similar to serotonin and activates your visual cortex.  Its an interesting experience, but the netflix mushroom doc that i think you are referring to makes it seem like its all super spiritual and loving. It can be, but it can also be awkward and scary.
Energy is a word that has several meanings. In this context it refers to psychological energy, which isn’t stored in an organ as such. You shouldn’t try to apply physics principles to psychological energy, as a concept it lives in an entirely different framework.
You pee more in the cold because you're losing less water through your skin. In the hot weather, your skin sweats to cool you, so there's less water making it to your bladder. In the cold, you don't sweat.
It means your organs just gave out one day. Eventually something's gotta give, maybe your heart fails or you have an aneurysm or something. It just happens overnight and it's not worth investigating/desecrating the body to figure out exactly what the cause was, so they chalk it up to "natural causes".
Same way a computer program is just 0 and 1, yea, not many options, but if you combine it enough you can get as many combinations as you need, just needs to be long enough. Because of that, it's essentially the length that determines the complexity. As for a set, yes, DNA has start and stop codons, essentially a protein is defined by the stuff between a start and stop codon. Since the ends are marked, proteins can be as long as they need to be.
If plants needed someone to cultivate them in order to exist, plants wouldn't exist. They need a way to distribute their seeds, else their species doesn't go on. Now, some seeds do require. Some plants do have unorthodox or methods of dispersal that require external aid. For example, certain pine cones that carry new seed need to exposed to intense heat in order to open (to replace burned down trees from forest fires. Others have little sails so that when they fall, gravity and aerodynamics carry them away (helicopter seeds/dandelions). There's this annoying weed in my front yard that launches seeds whenever the thing gets touched.  A seed doesn't necessarily need to be buried in order to produce w plant. They can sprout a root on the surface that will then creep into the soil, then sprout it's above ground parts.
Your skin is trying to protect itself, so it produces tiny little shades to block harmful light.
Animals will do this if they detect defects in the newborn that will be detrimental to its survival, so it's basically a mercy killing.  Humans, with resources, might be able to make the defective persons life quality good enough, but animals cannot.  They eat it because it's free food.  Finding food as an animal is hard enough.
Spicy is caused not by actual heat, but by chemicals, for example capsaicin in hot peppers, that trick the nerves in your body into THINKING that they’re hotter than they really are, they then send signals to the brain, and the brain things that you must be really hot/burning. That’s what causes spicy. Well the same way that can happen in your mouth, it can also happen coming out the other end of those chemical survive the digestive system. Just this time tricking the nerves in your butt instead of in your mouth.
Cancer cells are your cells, mutated beyond recognition into hostile agents. This means that your immune system doesn’t identify them as a threat, and will let them do damage indefinitely. It also means that they’re human cells and have human cell metabolisms, so you can’t kill them without killing *all* the human cells. So this presents the medical community with a grave situation - your own cells are trying to kill you, the usual immune response doesn’t care, and you have to kill these camouflaged insurgents without killing everything. It will not resolve by itself, so without treatment prognosis is almost always fatal.
Nobody is 100% sure. Thats where we are - there are lots of hypotheses but when ketamine comes along and seems to work instantly whereas prozac takes weeks then all bets are off,
The sense of high ground, basically when you confident enough that nothings going to hurt you, then there's no reason to be scared. It's like that Japanese police that don't even chase after the racers because they knew their car won't be fast enough. It's best to reserve energy to do a quick dash when needed, rather waste all those energy running away from something that won't get you.
They'd look as similar to the original as identical twins look to each other, since a clone (one organism created from the genome of another) is essentially an artificially-conceived identical twin (two organisms created from the same genome).
There is a lot of DNA that doesn’t change from human to human.  Despite that, each human’s DNA differs by about 6.4 million base pairs.  For any given pair to be the same is a 50/50 shot, so for all 6.4 million pairs to be the same would be like tossing a coin 6.4 million times and getting the same result every time. The odds of this are so astronomically low that it’s basically 0.
Evolution is driven by random mutations over a very, very long time. Somewhere along the line someone developed a mutation to fear things that look like snakes. Over generation after generation they had kids that also feared snakes, while other humans without that mutation kept getting killed by snakes and not having kids. Eventually the decendants of the snake fearers outnumber the people who don't.  Probably won't happen with guns. Technology advances faster than evolution. Weapons won't look like guns in 10,000 years
Different medications metabolize at different rates. So you need to take them often to avoid too much or too little medication in your system. There are very few medication which have effects lasting more then a week though. And when you are dealing with monthly medication you are most likely talking about medications that needs to be taken at certain points in the menstrual cycle or slow release delivery. The last one is pills which take a long time to dissolve and will release small amount of medications as they do so. Obviously this can not be done orally but needs to be injected.
They don't. What sports drinks are supposed to do is replace minerals/salts/electrolytes (different words for the same stuff) that you may have lost during intense physical exercise. They also have sugar to replace the calories you burn during the same activity. Unless you are an elite athlete in the middle of an actual competition, you do not need a sports drink (even then, the evidence is pretty sparse that they help). A normal diet has more than enough minerals for even the most work-out obsessed individual. Even if you exclusively drink distilled water, there will be more than enough salt in your diet to keep you going.
Releasing pressure in your ears. Can also occur if you hold your nose and mouth closed and attempt to breath out.  These things are helpful on airplanes when you make changes in elevation. Otherwise you may be yelling at your flight attendant. Also helpful on mountain drives or hikes.
They actually don't. Studies have shown that doctors have no worse handwriting when compared to other healthcare employees and other occupations. They do have pretty bad handwriting though. Because of the amount of things they have to write throughout their study and practice, and the little amount of time they have for writing, their handwriting tends to be geared towards speed rather than legibility. I think the reason doctors' handwriting is singled out as being particularly bad is because you actually get to see their handwriting regularly in the form of prescriptions.
It’s only recently we discovered that brains don’t fully mature until 25. Society had long since established adulthood as being 18 and it’s too late to change it now.
Maybe your cousin looks a lot like your grandmother, but you look nothing like her. That doesn't mean your cousin is more closely related to your grandmother than you are. They may share a few outward genes, but so much of your DNA is under the hood that that's pretty insignificant. Huskies and Poodles are "grandchildren" to ancient wolves.
The meats serve a different purpose when the animal is still alive. More work required from that muscle means longer fibers (more beefy texture) and more myoglobin (the red color) for extra oxygen storage. Chicken breast, for example, isn't used very much when the chicken is alive. It's developed very short fibers- that slimy texture when raw- and hardly any myoglobin- it's white. The flavor mostly comes down to the subtle differences in diet. TL;DR  - lots of muscle use = long fibers, lots of red color  - little muscle use = short fibers, little red color  - long fibers = tougher/chewier texture  - short fibers = softer/tender texture
If your liver and kidneys were not functioning correctly. IE not detoxing your body. You would be dead.  End of story.
The brain triggers the release of a hormone called ghrelin in response to an empty stomach or in anticipation of the next meal. Ghrelin signals the body to release stomach acids to digest food. If food is not consumed, the stomach acids begin to attack the lining of the stomach, causing hunger pains.
Because both oxygen and nitrogen, the 2 gases that make up most of air, become toxic at higher pressure that occur at greater depths. In order to avoid these toxic effects, you need to reduce the partial pressure of these gasses to keep them below toxic levels. This means changing the ratio of nitrogen and oxygen found in air, or replacing the nitrogen with another gas like helium.
A couple of reasons.  First, an owl is a carnivore, and any particular ecosystem can support far fewer carnivores than other types of organism - there really are fewer owls than, say, omnivores like the seagull.  But also, most owls are nocturnal.  They're out at night, where you aren't.  Add those things together, and the fact that they mostly avoid populated areas, and you've got an owl sighting as a fairly rare event.
Yes, it will leak into surrounding tissue, that is basically what bruising is. Unless you have coagulation issues or other problems preventing it, it will heal on it's own.
Any cell has a voltage difference across its plasma membrane that is key in controlling the transport of certain ions in and out of the cell (because that's linked to a variety of important processes and signaling pathways). *Action potential*, to my understanding, specifically refers to the chain reaction of membrane depolarisation  that travels down a nerve. These are the actual signals that nerves transmit, and needless to say their proper functioning is of critical importance.
Fish are ectothermic ("cold blooded"), which means they don't actively maintain a body temperature in a certain range. A fever works by raising the target temperature the body is trying to reach, which turns on the processes the body uses to warm up, so fish aren't physiologically capable of having a fever the way humans are.
It may have something to do with blood flow? Like all the blood in your body goes to your chest which is being heated up and then pumps out into the rest of you, making you warm faster?
Because the gases are either heavier or lighter than air, and air is what we are used to the sound waves vibrating through. Helium is lighter than air, and so the sound waves travel faster through it while resonating in your larynx
They’re still there, dead. Killing them stops them from multiplying inside your guts later and causing a problem. It doesn’t magically remove them or their toxic waste chemicals, which is why boiling rotten meat doesn’t make it safe.
Yes and no. Drinking a lot of water after ingesting a lot of salt IS a good idea, it’ll help dilute the salt and keep you hydrated. Buuuttt. Your body still needs to process all that salt, it’s still in there. Just a bit more diluted and your body a bit more hydrated. So eventually that salt will make its way through your body, through your blood, wherever it ends up, and probably eventually either Sweat out of you or peed out of you as your kidneys filter it out of your blood. So drinking water is good, but it doesn’t completely negate the salt
Your sinuses (what your nostrils feed into and then into your trachea and lungs) isn't one big cavity. [It's actually 4 different chambers](https://breathefreely.com/pasha-chamber-of-sinuses/) (2 for each nostril) for the majority of the population (there's an estimated 10% of the population that have 6 sinus chambers/3 per nostril). So the short and simple of it is that any of the 4 chambers could be inflamed at any given time causing the 'stuffy nose' symptom in one or both nostrils. But, your body is pretty good about making sure you keep breathing (unless you have sleep apnea) so it regulates the erectile tissue in each side of your sinus to usually make sure you can breath out of one of them.  To get a little deeper into it, the process of warming and humidifying the air you're breathing into your lungs through your nose is energy and resource intensive so your body only sends the extra blood to one nostril at a time. But this extra blood causes the tissue to swell (kind of like when you injure your skin and the area around it swells because of the increased blood flow to the injury) and when you're sick you already have increased blood flow to the infection in your sinuses and this increases the stuffiness on the side your body is trying to regulate the air quality in. Here's a good read about it with the science to back it up: https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19535169/nasal-cycle/
My understanding (check with an actual person who understands such things and not an armchair expert as myself) is that your brain associated squid with the unpleasant experience of food poisoning. So even with good quality squid that’s prepared properly, your brain recognizes the squid and goes, “oh no, this gives bad stomach issues” even if it was a one off experience. I had something similar happen with hot pockets and a stomach flu in high school. Can’t eat hot pockets anymore.
Your eyes are controlled by muscles as almost anything else in your body. Looking at screens makes your eyes fixate very close spots, narrowing down your field of view both mentally and physically. By looking far, you allow your eyes to use their muscles in another way and leave a tense state as well as your brain to process different signals.  See it this way: After spending a day with your head turned to the left, looking straight or even right will feel very relieving.
Because your pushing the blood out. The tiny capillaries beneath the nail bed keeps your nails looking pink.  When you squeeze the nail or when your very cold, the capillaries are shut off and fresh blood can't come in.  If you squeeze the nail til it turns white and then let go, it should turn pink within 5 seconds. This is called a capillary refill test and indicates there is healthy blood flow to the finger.
When you swallow, your soft palate lifts and gets out of the way.  Your body is expecting to swallow food so there's no gag reflex. When you stick your finger down your throat, it's as if something is stuck.  As such, you need to throw up.
Your esophagus has muscles that move food along it down into your stomach. The muscle contractions are coordinated so it pushes food along the passage no matter what position your body is in. It isn’t gravity based.
Cancer cells try to multiply faster than normal cells. The goal is to kill the cancer cells without killing you. So chemotherapy uses poisons that specifically damage cells when they're trying to multiply, which affect cancer cells more than they affect the rest of you, to kill the cancer cells. But because it's still a poison - a poison sufficiently nasty to kill all the millions of cancer cells in the body - it still does a lot of damage to the rest of you.
There is not definite timeline, it depends from individual to individuals.  To be clear and simple : Alcohol acts (among other stuff) on a communication system in the brain called "the GABAergique system" : This system act as a brake on neurons in order to calm down the nervous system and "harmonize" the firing of neurons. Alcohol mimick the effect of this system and since our brain is all for the balance of power, if you are exposed to a lot of alcohol for a long time your brain will be like "fine, since alcohol is there, then I don't really need the original GABA system no more". That's how you get physically addicted, the day you get at that stage and you don't drink alcohol your cool-down system of your brain will not be there and it will take a few days for it come back , thus inducing the shakes, sweats, mental worries, and delirium tremens : your system is fired up to a point you get massive seizures and you can die from it.  Now as in how long it takes to get to that stage ? I don't think there is a definite answer, it's usually with a lot of time and repeated regular exposure, however everyone is different, you have alcoholics who have been drinking for decades and have hardly any physical withdrawal symptoms, and some "new" alcoholics go full delirium tremens.  And for your question : Would it be worse to drink one drink every day for a year, or 7 drinks one day a week for a year? Both are bad. The first is how you will close to a classic alcoholic consumption aka regular daily and sinked into the habit. The second one is basically binge drinking (drinking a large amount for a short period of time by "episode") and binge drinking can also leads to alcoholism and other mental health issues.
Your eyes are set apart (and in most people are not precisely level), so they receive slightly different images. Close one eye and hold a finger up, aligned to a point in front of you  Without moving your finger, close your open eye, and open your closed eye. You'll see that your finger no longer lines up with the object because it's getting a slightly different image. The further away the object, the less difference between the 2 images. Your brain combines the 2 images to create a sense of depth. I don't know how the brain works, only the eye bit!
They don’t. If their simple brains decide you’re a threat they’ll sting you and sometimes release special chemicals to mark you as a threat to their friends, regardless of whether you are trying to harm them or not. People have been stung to death simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
The reason is that "red" cones are almost as sensitive to Violet light, as "blue" cones are. L ("red") cones have very long "tails" to their bell curve shaped sensitivity. S ("blue") cones have a narrower sensitivity curve. Once you get out to the Violet range of wavelengths <420 nm, then the S come sensitivity starts dropping off rapidly. The L curve sensitivity fell off at much higher wavelength but the long tail is still going along at a low level and falling only very slowly. By about 405nm, the blue sensitivity has fallen so much that it is not much higher than the red tail. So as a ratio, there is a mixed L/S cone stimulus, the only catch is that neither S nor L cones have good sensitivity to Violet, so the perception is dim.
we need calories from food to convert to sugar so we can function.  Nutrients only keep us healthy and operating at maximum potential, you can survive with nutrient deficiencies;  you cannot survive starvation. your body has functions that need energy (food/calories) which nutrients do not provide (by themselves)
Moisture. Some flowers can actually rot depending on the humidity and moisture within the plant itself. Vegetables having significantly more moisture are prone to rot much easier
There’s not a 100% definitely know cause, but the leading theory is that screwing around with the serotonin levels in the brain affects the hypothalamus.   The hypothalamus is kind of the control center for other hormones.  Mess with that and the other hormones necessary for arousal and orgasm are impaired.
There might be others, but they're usually muscle relaxers. Your pupil is a muscle that tightens to shrink. The eye drops knock that muscle out temporarily so the muscle goes slack and your pupil dilates.
You can. The biggest risk is iron poisoning. You have to drink a lot of REALLY rusty water to get that sick though. Generally if we see water that has a visible red tint, we won't drink it. Generally if it's not dirty enough to show a tint there's not enough rust to be a problem. (Different bodies react differently though!) Also pipes rust differently on the inside and outside, because rust formation depends on a lot of factors. So a pipe might be really rusty on the outside but still clean on the inside depending on those factors. So seeing a rusty pipe might not mean there's rust in the water.
It's not so much the blood vessels themselves that are different. The blood vessels in the brain do have special features, but the [blood-brain barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier) is mainly related to a kind of cell called an [astrocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte). Astrocytes have extensions called feet that stick to the blood vessel and wrap around its outer wall. Most blood vessels in the brain are covered by a dense layer of astrocyte feet that form a [physical barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia_limitans). Any substance that "wants" to get into a neuron or other brain cell must first cross through astrocytes. There are some exceptions though (for example, parts of the brain that are exposed to the bloodstream with no blood brain barrier include the pineal gland, some parts of the hypothalamus, and some parts of the brain stem). Here's a good [picture](https://s3.cad.rit.edu/cadgallery_production/images/uploads/faculty-f-projects/340/951.jpeg) showing how astrocyte feet help to form the blood brain barrier. You can see that astrocytes basically get to choose what enters the brain and what doesn't. Some substances are able to enter passively (usually small molecules that are often fat soluble), but others (such as glucose) need to be actively transported across. Many drugs and toxins lack the ability to cross the blood brain barrier as a result of being too large or not very fat-soluble (non-lipophilic). In general, astrocytes usually allow nutrients through while blocking most other substances from reaching neurons and other brain cells. edit: just as a technical note so that this doesn't mislead you, the blood brain barrier is not only formed by astrocytes. Other cell types are also involved. The endothelial cells of the blood vessel itself are also a key part of the blood brain barrier as another answer says. Another kind of cell involved is the [pericyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericyte). But astrocytes are the main cellular link between neurons and the bloodstream. Continuous capillaries are not unique to the brain.
It's related to the opposite question: "What are tree leaves green?".  They are green because of chlorophyll, a green chemical that absorbs light and uses the light energy to drive a chemical process backwards, making food that powers the tree.  When the hours of sunlight decrease, the food needed to keep the leaves alive remains constant and instead of providing excess food to make the tree grow, that can't make that much.  So, the tree drops those losers who aren't pulling their own weight.  Before that, the green fades and you see the color of the structure that's always under the green "solar panel" covering.  Maple trees have red structure, Oak trees yellow, and so on an so forth.  It's all in the genetics of the tree, like some people have black hair and some people have red hair.
The same reason we humans love sugar and sugary things.  Sugar is like one of the best energy molecules to eat, it’s super simple and easy to digest and for our cells to use. Ants need food too, and simple sugars are a good one for them too
being high = more happy chemicals in your brain More happy chemicals in your brain = feeling happier feeling happier = stuff is better &#x200B; There is no separation of body and mind. If you're high, your 'body' is high too and the stuff you do will be elated to some degree. Music will sound better, movies will be more exciting, candy tastes sweeter. As for why/how stuff gets you high, that's another question.
> The brain is a muscle.  The brain is not a muscle.  That statement is just a figure of speech, not a physiological truth, so physiological rules should not be applied. > I have been told to not use my brain. Don't read, don't play logic games, don't watch documentaries because they make you think. Your brain has been injured in a concussion.  As I mentioned, it is *not* a muscle, and rather than physical therapy what it initially needs is rest and time to heal, like a broken bone.  If you use it too heavily while it's healing, it may slow the healing process or result in further damage, just like a bone. The reasons *why* this is true aren't fully understood, but studies have shown that resting your brain after an injury speeds recovery.  More recent studies have shown however that light problem solving starting within a few days can help prevent psychological disorders like depression.
You could be routinely breaking your REM cycles, and this shorter sleep happens to wake you up when you're not in one. If you can remember your dreams--particularly if you are aware you were in one at the moment of waking-- then it's *very* likely you are breaking REM, which causes your grogginess and low energy.  A full cycle is important and healthy, but getting two and a half cycles is still better sleep than getting just one, even though you'll wake feeling better rested in the second case.
The renal system, specifically the kidneys, regulate blood volume by controlling how much fluid is in the blood. Kidneys will also secrete the hormone erythropoietin to tell the stem cells within the bone marrow to produce more blood cells. So it involves the kidneys either way, but pressure is a short term fluid issue, not from the production of blood cells.
Unlike humans who get meals fed to us when ever we need and then spend the rest of the day doing nothing. Elephants probably spend the majority of their day eating, and taking bites of things as large as full pizzas
This is very easy to answer. Your body makes two types of cholesterol  high density and low density.  The LDL or low density lipoproteins are the ones that tend to stick to the arterie walls an build up over time eventually blocking the flow of blood. When you get a blood test it will tell you how much of both you have in your blood if the number for HDL is high that's good because your body is taking cholesterol out of your blood back to your liver for re processing. If your LDL is high that's bad because the more you have in your blood the greater chance it will begin to collect in arteries and stop the flow causing heart attack or stroke.
Obligatory IMNAS. It depends at what age the tumor get removed. In child's neuroplasticity allow the brain to rewire itself to mimic part of the functionality that got lost along the tumor. The more you get older, the less this ability is effective, so down to earth, you could permanently lose some function that is related to the lobe the tumor was attached to.
While viral load is an important factor in many aspects, it does not really matter a whole lot in this situation. While you are symptomatic, the amount of pathogen (virus/bacteria, typically) in your system that your own body is already producing is going to be factors higher than the amount you're breathing in from your sick roommate. We're talking millions or billions times more than what you would breathe in from your roommate.
Your body has a huge amount of control over your feelings. Scary movies can make your heart race, placebos can cure diseases if you believe they can, depression and anxiety can have significant physical effects. Your body produces chemicals, manages nerve signals, determines how you see, hear, think, and experience the world. Heartache is not even the most dramatic thing that the human body can do to itself.
It's not terrible.  Peanut butter was invented to feed People who had nutritional issues.   Now in a PB and J sandwich, there's a shit ton of carbs, but by itself it's not like a person is eating garbage
You just Aren’t cleaning it well enough because it leaked into all the foam and every little spot across the whole thing
Height and weight are not great indicators of strength.  However, as far as a fight is concerned, 2 people of equal skill, the taller heavier person will have an advantage.  More height gives better reach.  If we throw a punch at the same time and I am taller, mine will connect first.  More weight allows you to put more power in to a punch or kick.  It gives an advantage when wrestling as the heavier person is harder to move.  Again this assumes skill levels in fighting are equal.
Every joint has a fluid in it call "synovial fluid" which helps you joint move smoothly. Like any fluid, it can get bubbles in it. When those bubbles get trapped between the moving bones in the joint, they pop.
Well, there’s two things here. First, for Cheeses that you are meant to eat moldy, like Bleu cheese, they are very specific kinds of mold that are grown and cultivated like other foods then mixed in/added with the cheese. It isn’t just random mold growing on it. These are known to be safe and are used to enhance smell/flavor. Then, for other cheeses when if you find mold on a block of it you can just cut it off and eat the rest, this is because since blocks of cheese are typically harder/denser. The tendrils and spores of the mold can’t spread very deep into the cheese, so you can just cut off the bad area.
Genetics has a big part in it, yes. We've bred chickens that lay eggs (and, consequently, can reproduce) much faster than their ancestral/wild counterparts. We did this by repeatedly having the most frequent egg-layers reproduce while culling the worst. Do this over and over again, for many, many generations, and you get a chicken breed that lays extremely rapidly (relative to the wild type). The problem with this is that it takes time to both implement and remove these traits. You might not be able to have the near-extinct species survive long enough to increase their reproductive rate, or have enough members of the species to even do it. Then, once they're breeding like rabbits, you'd have to cull them the other way (decreasing the reproductive rate), or they'll spread everywhere, like rabbits. Theoretically, the same can be done for plants, but trees, for example, have extremely long generations, which means it would take too long to induce that kind of behavior (high CO2 absorption/growth).
Headaches are a symptom of something. The headache itself can't harm you, the thing that causes the headache might though. Headache is just as real as any other feeling. They are electrochemical signals, so you could in theory physically measure them. (Wich is true for every feeling or thought)
If you've received an organ, no matter which, you're not allowed to donate organs yourself. So that's not something that'd happen.
The loss of ability to focus on close-up objects isn't because the muscle of the eye gets weaker. It's because the lens of the eye gets less elastic. The lens is naturally elastic; it wants to be flexed. But it's surrounded by stretchy ligaments that hold it under tension and keep it flattened. When you flex your eye muscle to focus, it doesn't directly push the lens into shape. All the muscle does is release the tension in the ligaments that are pulling the lens out of shape; the lens's own natural elasticity is what causes it to focus harder. But as you get older, it loses that elasticity, meaning your max focus power decreases. Think of it along the same lines as your skin beginning to sag as you get older.
I think most of the comments are dodging the deeper question of why cells are unable to divide and reproduce endlessly. While it's true that we evolved to include cell death, and evolved to die, there is an underlying biology that causes cell senescence. The problem is damage to your cells' DNA. In order to repair any damage, your cells have to be able to produce the necessary proteins. Imagine keeping a 3D printer working by 3D printing the parts you need to repair it. As a bearing or nozzle begins to wear down, you can just print a new one and install it. In fact, if your 3D printer falls apart entirely, you can use your other 3D printer to print an entirely new printer. However, in order to do that you have to have the files that the printer uses in order to print the parts you need. If those files get corrupted in one of the printers, it won't be able to correctly make the part that it needs. If the file is only a little damaged, the printer may be able to sort of make a new part that *mostly* works, but it isn't perfect. As you replace parts, even between different printers, the new parts will be made from corrupted files so the parts will be less and less able to work properly. Why can't your cells repair their DNA? Your cells *do* repair DNA, a *lot*. However, their methods for detecting damage aren't perfect. Some damage inevitably manages to sneak through. It may *appear* to not be damaged by the proteins built to find damage. Or, the damage may occur on the parts of the DNA needed to *make* those proteins, so that cell can't detect the damage at all. Or, the genes you need to build the repair proteins may themselves get damaged and broken. Eventually, inevitably, damage accrues and your cells' ability to detect or repair the damage wanes, until the damage *cannot* be repaired and your cells have to make do with faulty proteins. The damage comes mainly from three broad sources. The first is mutations caused by carcinogens and radiation. These things directly damage your DNA. As stated, your cells have a lot of ways to detect this damage and fix it, or to cause the cell to self-destruct so that it can't pass that damage on to a new line of cells. That can always fail, though. The catastrophic version of that failure is malignant cancer, but even if the cells don't become cancerous they may not be able to do their job effectively. Another source is errors that occur during DNA replication. DNA is a *big* complicated molecule and the proteins that copy your DNA strands don't always work the way they should. You guessed it: your cells have tools to avoid that happening and tools to fix it when it does happen, but again, sometimes those tools fail and an error occurs. That error might insert, delete, move around, or change the base pairs as they get copied. One or both of the new daughter cells will take that error with it, and if that error damages a vital gene, the cell can't build that protein and may not be able to do its job. The last source is a bit more complicated and has to do with how cells copy DNA. There is an enzyme that your cells build that "unzips" your DNA, and then another enzyme (actually two, it's complicated) comes along and grabs onto the end of it and "zips" it back up, using new base pairs for one side so that one side of the new strand is old base pairs and the other side is new base pairs. The enzyme that "zips" the DNA back up needs a bit of DNA to grab onto. It can't start at the *very* end. It's kind of like an actual zipper, that you need the little tab at the end to pull the zipper on. That little end tab does *not* get copied by the enzyme. That means some of your DNA gets left behind and doesn't get copied. Your DNA has bits of DNA stuck to the ends called *telomeres* that exist solely to be grabbed by that enzyme and get left behind without getting copied to the new DNA. Since the telomeres don't code for anything, it doesn't matter that your new cells lose it. Your cells start with a *bunch* of telomeres and lose them over time. Eventually, cells that reproduce very quickly (like skin cells) run out of telomeres and start losing important DNA as it gets copied. When your cells are first dividing as an embryo, they produce an enzyme that builds those telomeres so you don't run out too early. At a very young age, though, the gene to make that enzyme turns off, the enzyme goes away, and you stop making telomeres. Why? Because, as stated by others, death is built into our evolution. There's no point in building endless telomeres as your risk of dying to disease, predators, or cancer increases with age. You have also evolved to die so that you don't continue to take resources from your offspring, which would decrease their chances of surviving and spreading your/their genes further. TL;DR: Your cells need DNA instructions to build the things needed to repair themselves and everything else in your body. Your DNA gets damaged as you age until your cells don't have the instructions they need to build the things they need to repair damage.
Cholesterol is kind of a generic term, sort of like saying you're Christian. There are many religions that fall under the blanket of Christianity and there's multiple types of Cholesterol as well.  LDL is bad cholesterol and it's typically found foods with high saturated or trans fat. Processed meats like deli meat, high fat/full fat dairy products, and butter, for example.  This is the stuff that causes plaque to form in your arteries and can lead to heart attack or stroke.  HDL is good cholesterol and is found in foods such as *eggs*, fatty fish, shellfish, and oatmeal. HDL basically serves as an escort for LDL. When your HDL levels are strong, it will act like a security guard at a casino and will approach the LDL and say "I need you to step away from the arteries and come with me." The HDL will then escort the LDL to a dark room (your liver) and beat the ever loving crap out of it.  Your liver naturally produces HDL on its own, but if your LDL intake is too high, the liver won't be able to match production and that's when you put yourself at risk.  As is the case for most things in life, moderation and balance are key. Edit for typos
Well, it comes down to two things. How much energy can you store in the walking thing and how much energy does the walking thing consume to walk. Fat is relatively good way to store energy, yes it takes longer time to convert energy stored in fat to movement than doing it with batteries but still. Body fat can store 10 kWh of energy per kg, while batteries only 2,5. Also fat is distributed all around human body while robots batteries are only stored in one place, which gives you more room for "batteries" in a human. That means human will have much more energy available to him than a robot of the same size. Humans are made out of meat and bone which are about as dense as water. Robots are made of much denser metal so a robot will be heavier than a human of same size. Heavier the thing that you want to walk, the more energy will it consume to walk. Also human walking is really fluid, rhythmic motion. You make the first step, get into a rhythm and then most of your body moves just with inertia. The muscles don't really do that much, they just correct small errors we make each step. To make a step you just lift the leg a bit, bend the knee, and the leg swings forward like a pendulum "for free". Robots don't know how to do that. They have to accelerate and decelerate the entire weight of the leg every time they make a step and that wastes energy.
Sounds is sensed by changes in air pressure. Loud noise equals high air pressure gradient. Very loud noise, like an explosion, can have enough pressure to stretch the eardrum beyond tolerance and rupture m
Basically,  the human brain is a pattern engine. When a memory is fragmented, or incomplete, our brain fills in the gaps with something that makes sense. So. Even if you remember it a certain way, that doesn't mean it actually happened that way.
Mirror gazing is a topic of special interest because it can lead to "anomalous perceptions" of the self, even in healthy people.  [Mirror- and Eye-Gazing: An Integrative Review of Induced Altered and Anomalous Experiences](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0276236620969632)
Different number of chromosomes. Horses have 64, donkeys have 62. Cross them and you get a mule that has 63. Odd number of chromosomes means they cant sexually reproduce.
Try to not think like a human for a minute. Instead of the most phenomenal biological supercomputer the earth has ever seen, imagine you have a brain the size of a grain of rice.  It doesn’t “think” about things, and it doesn’t have feelings or memories. You are fish. You see other fish. Other fish fits in your mouth, thus it is food. The fact that other fish is your own brother means nothing.  You don’t recognize him, or remember him.  You live purely on instinct, and that instinct says to eat things that fit in your mouth.
They don't store silk in their bodies. It's actually a liquid that they are constantly creating in a gland. It hardens into silk when in contact with air. A very little bit of the fluid goes a long way.
They contain Isoflavones wich could be dangerous. But for that to matter you'd have to eat insane amounts of Soy Beans. In excess anything can harm you
Firstly, you are not your parents child, because there are some original egg and sperm cells in your body. All your cells, new and old, come from the original fertilized egg you don't evolve your own DNA or cells independently of them. Secondly, not all your cells replace every seven years, it is simply an average. For example brain and nerve cells generally live longer and your stomach lining lasts about two weeks. The more complex answer: The fertilized egg splits up and divides into two cells, they are not the fertilized egg anymore. You could describe them as the children of the original cell. These cells split again, and then these split again. This goes on for a few generations until you have many cells which are the "great-great-great-grandchildren" of the fertilized egg. These start to specialize and form your body. Any cell in your body is basically an ancestor to the original egg and sperm, even when they get replaced.
"Gut biome" is a term that describes the culture of bacteria that live in your digestive tract. They're vital to the way our bodies process food and they communicate back to us through chemical messages.  When you regularly eat a particular food or group of similar foods, you foster the gut microbes that feed on those foods. They proliferate far more than other microbes, and in this way your body adapts to eating that kind of food. You will start to crave foods you eat regularly because that's what your gut biome is adapted to digesting.
The outer layers of skin, the epidermis, is the skin that sheds. Exfoliating.  The deeper skin is the dermis and that doesn't shed. Cut that and it won't renew. That's where tattoos sit too, hence why they last so long.
Our primitive instincts have developed over the last billion years of life to be just that,  instinct.  We've only been self aware for what, 100k years? It's probably gonna take a while to evolve away from them.
Reptiles on average have more offspring than mammals and reproduce by laying eggs. Animals in eggs are more susceptible to environmental conditions which may affect the embryo inside.  Being two-head, which is called bicephaly, can also result from an embryo splitting in two (this is how twins form) but sometimes they don't split completely and this is how conjoined twins form.
2x2 *means* "2 + 2".  "2x2" means "two times, add up the number 2".  It's simply the definition of multiplication. Likewise, 2^(2) just means 2x2, which means 2+2.  None of these things are quirks or strange properties, they're just examples of what we've defined math terms to mean.
They’re more like glitter than insects.   You can try all you want to keep them just on one part of your body, but they inevitably spread.  However, this doesn’t take into consideration that your body already is covered in bacteria glitter, and it’s just a matter of which ones survive and regrow.
We don't exactly know for sure, but the most popular theory involves myofascial release. Essentially, your muscle is made up of individual fibers. The fascia is like a sausage casing made of a bunch of strands that cover each individual fiber and the muscle itself. Those strands can get tangled up and stuck together. This leads to those knots in your muscles (formally called myofascial trigger points) you love so much. The slow pressure from a foam roller (and you should be using a foam roller very slowly), can help loosen up those knots.
Upper digestive hemorrhage. Its definitely a thing that can happen. Significant bleeding by a ruptured blood vessel in the esophagus, stomach and duodenum can cause hematemesis (vomiting blood).  Of course movies always will exaggerate the volume of blood, but yes it is possible. Also, there are many non violent causes of hematemesis such as cirrhosis, stomach ulcer (cancer), aneurysms oh and it's possible to cough so violently that you tear your esophagus and bleed from it.
Because your body adapts to function. If you were to repeatedly break and rupture them via trauma, you'll just get hard scar tissue. The breaking is on a near microscopic scale and signals the body "oh. This muscle is failing when we lift this weight and we are lifting this weight constantly. I need to strengthen it because we are taking on increased loads regularly and this tearing is dangerous." When you beat on it, the body instead goes "this area is receiving a lot of blunt force and macroscopic trauma. I need to harden and protect this area like armor" and you get scars. That isn't to say temporarily doing this or doing this once in a while is absolutely bad. It's kinda what massaging and stretching and Myofascial release do to a lesser extent.it just won't get the same results as lifting weights.
Because your can't exercise a bone; you can only exercise the muscles that are attached to that bone. When you say your "knee" is injured, most of the time - unless you actually fractured your patella - that is going to mean the muscles or ligaments attached to your knee.
You're out of coolant and electrolytes.  Then you over-heat and your brain cooks eventually. If you recognize symptoms, they are reversible.  If you don't, you die.  Drink water, get salt in you.  Get cooled off and you're fine.  Don't cool off, and die.  Drink water too fast, and you die.  When I had it, I went down in the traces on the farm.  I couldn't walk.  My dad gave me a ride back home.  I ate some salt, drank water, and made myself peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwiches. Cooled off in the basement and I was right as rain in half an hour. If I'd stayed in the field, I'd have been dead within the hour.  You don't always notice that you're overheating.  You have to think about it.
Ok imagine a bundle of 100000 cables thinner than hair and all looking the exact same get severed. Your job is to connect them correctly one by one. How do you know which with which and how do you grab them and reconnect them without further damaging them? If you solve those 3 problems you will be rich.
It's called the uvula, and one purpose of it is to help lubricate the back of the throat by being knocked around. People who have the uvula removed (which is perfectly safe) often complain about chronic dry throat.
Supplements generally don't include fats, proteins, and carbs, aside from very specific ones like fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids). Under that assumption, supplements of all the necessary vitamins and minerals won't provide your body with enough calories/energy to keep running. If you "supplement" (heh) your supplements with sufficient calories in the form of carbs, protein, and fats, then you can live off of it. But at this point, you're just describing a balanced diet; it's not a "supplement only" diet anymore if you're eating regular food.
I don't know where everyone suddenly got the idea that inbreeding is some sort of impossible hurdle to reproduction. Sure, it's not optimal, and will result in offspring that are sometimes mildly less fit than the alternative, but it's still successful reproduction and will rapidly increase the size of the gene pool so that inbreeding is no longer a concern after a few more generations. It is what it is. Sometimes you have no choice.
The longer the telomeres the more times a cell can replicate itself, the more times a cell replicates the more chances of mistakes being made in the copying process hence cancer.
These scales send a very minor (harmless) electric signal through the body and essentially measure the amount that comes back to the scale. Fat, Muscle, and Water all respond differently to the electric signal, absorbing some of it or conducting it. The scale figures out roughly the proportion of the contents of your body by the amount of electric signal it gets back
First off, the symptoms we associate with the cold aren't caused by a single virus, but by any of something like 200+ viruses, with about 35% of cases being caused by rhinoviruses, so it's not as simple as just developing a single vaccine for "the cold virus" because...there *is* no single "cold virus". And secondly, the cold is just...not very high on the priority list.  It's not particularly deadly or severe and lots of people get it and recover just fine on a regular basis.  Research is more focused on more pressing threats.
Livestock are often given preventative antibiotics. This is problematic for two main reasons: one, it implies/allows the livestock to be kept in worse conditions. They can be packed in very close, and in less clean environments.  Second, overuse of antibiotics can lead to other downstream effects. They can end up in water and the environment. They can lead to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria.  Well-treated animals may still need or benefit from occasional antibiotics when they get sick. Unfortunately, food labeling doesn't put a distinction on this.
Sleep cycles are on average 90 minutes long. Waking in the middle of one can be very draining and leave you in a fog or with a "concrete head". The best way I found to avoid this is: if you have a set time when you wake up and get out of bed, set an additional alarm for 90 minutes ( 1 1/2 hours) before that time to reset your sleep cycle. That way, when it's time to actually wake up, it will be at the end of a cycle.
What dangers are you talking about? We don’t have any of the dangers from 100 years ago….we have antibiotics if we get sick or a bad injury…most of us don’t have to work with large farm animals…..we have reliable ways to heat our homes that don’t put off toxic fumes. Women have prenatal care throughout their pregnancy and can have surgical intervention if necessary….not to mention having a clean place to give birth if done naturally. Are you thinking of specific dangers?
Your body is constantly producing heat. It's also constantly losing heat to its environment through your skin. The rate at which the heat leaves depends on external factors like the air temperature, the clothes you have on, etc. If you're producing heat faster than you're expelling it, you feel hot. If you're expelling heat faster than you're producing it, you feel cold. If you're producing heat and expelling heat at roughly the same rate, you're comfortable. Let's say you're sleeping in a room that's 68F. You feel cold, because heat is leaving your body faster than you're producing it. So you crawl under a big, fluffy blanket. This blanket insulates you really well, and now you're producing heat faster than you're losing it. Now you start to feel uncomfortably warm. So you stick one leg out from under the covers. Now you're losing heat slowly through most of your skin, and quickly through a (relatively) small area of skin. By adjusting how much of your body is covered by clothing and blankets, you can find an equilibrium between the heat you produce and the heat you expel.
It's a side effect of our evolution. One part of our ancient ancestry that aided in our survival was that we collected resources that would help us. Now that we're at a point in our evolution where scarce resources aren't as big an issue, we instinctually keep objects we like.
The breaks won't help you. So I think the confusion here is because is that sunburn *isn't* about temperature, so your skin doesn't benefit at all if you "allow the skin to cool". It's about the UV rays hitting and damaging your skin and that damage will kick in in as little as 10 minutes in the sun. So unless your breaks means you are outside for a total of 4 hours over several days it makes no difference.
What made you think partying all night with makeup on is good? Makeup isn't good for your skin, full stop. The longer you leave it on, the worse it gets. If you then proceed to rub your face on a pillow for 8 hours, rubbing the makeup in even more, that's really bad. Sleeping all night with makeup on is bad, but partying all night with makeup on still isn't good.
Nothing. No meaningful force is exerted on a person between two repelling magnets. The only force the magnets exert is on each other. The area between them in not being impacted, unless you happen to put something magnet in that area. Magnetic fields are not physical, tangible fields. They don't "create" anything physical when they interact with each other.
A "water pill" does the exact opposite of what you think it does.   It makes you pee, which reduces the amount of water in your body.
Not a medical professional. Feet have lots of blood vessels and not much fat. Lots of heat lost through your feet. Similar case with your head. I don't know if this is a real saying, but I've been told that if your ears are cold, put on some socks.
Your intestines aren't just a pile of loose noodles inside your body. They're attached to what's called the [mesentery](https://www.google.com/search?q=mesentery&client=ms-android-sprint-us-revc&prmd=ivbn&sxsrf=ALeKk02W9skpkuHafFaYlDUNN0kQE5IVuQ:1627547476658&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWkM3p7ofyAhUMac0KHZwEB2EQ_AUoAXoECAIQAQ&biw=412&bih=733&dpr=2.63#imgrc=NrhRGPf3L-2-uM). That link shows a picture of the mesentery and how your intestines are connected to it. Little graphic, but no blood.
Some humans, not all. Most humans are interested in what technology can do for them, not necessarily in *how*. Good photographers are only interested in cameras to the extent that they enable them to make the picture they want to make. Few people are interested in how smartphones work; they are primarily interested in connecting with people. I could not care less about organic chemistry and biology. I am very interested in taking advantage of vaccines so I can stay alive.
Who’s gonna tell him?
Gargling with salt water can get rid of mucous on inflamed throat tissues, which relieves discomfort. Salt water is fantastic for cleaning, and it helps kill some bacteria, which can shorten the time of a sore throat.  Unfortunately we can’t scrub our throats due to gag reflexes and a whole mouth being in the way. Agitating the fluid allows for the most thorough clean, and gargling allows the liquid to reach a deeper level in the throat.  Holding water in the back of your throat doesn’t really pull the offending mucous off, which is the main point of gargling salt water.
In the throat there is a flap which opens and closes to let air through to the lungs when you are breathing and food down to the stomach when you are eating, it normally automatically directs things down the right "pipe" but occasionally mistakes are made.
Well, they don't say it with absolute certainty. It's just their best guess with the information they have.
The short answer is that they are pretty solid and difficult to break down in the blood stream.  This leads to them accumulating in the blood vessels potentially leading to clogging which can result in a heart attack or stroke.
By definition a weed is any plant that's growing where you don't want it.  A rose bush in a wheat field would be a weed, and wheat growing in a flower garden would also be a 'weed.' There's only so many plants that can grown in any one spot.  If you're trying to grow food, you don't want otehr plants coming in and taking up space/water from the plants you do want to grow.
A neat thing about the electromagnetic spectrum is that moving electricity can generate magnetism and and a moving magnetic field can generate electrical activity. If you did high school physics then that covers how all of that works.  TMS uses a wand that generates a magnetic field that moves or flips, which generates electrical activity within your brain. The amount that it can generate is actually really small but its able to effect how the neurons in your brain work at least temporarily. This is because neurons communicate using a combination of electrical and chemical signalling. We don't understand fully how it works - because we don't really understand how depression fully works, but its fairly safe and has temporary and beneficial effects for depression.
Cells with a mutation that makes them reproduce without stopping like normal cells do. Basically.
Have you never owned a cat? My cat turns on me for seemingly no reason whatsoever. It's instinct. A tiger or lion is just a large version of your house cat, they may even be playing and end up killing you because they are so powerful.
Plant based foods, even high in fat, do not have cholesterol because only animal cells produce it. What your doctor is asking you to manage is the thing you can control - ingestion of external cholesterol. It’s much harder to manage the other source, produced by your own cells.
>Different calculators give different results for maintenance calories - and I think this is because of the activity level option. You are correct. The difference is in the activity level you select, although TDEE with a sedentary activity level should be pretty much the same as BMR. &#x200B; >what is the difference between BMR and maintenance calories BMR is how many calories your body burns on a daily basis just by existing. Maintenance calories is how many calories you need to eat so you don't lose weight or gain weight.  &#x200B; > if different calculators are giving conflicting results (because you're unsure of your activity level, what should you do? These calculators are only estimates to give you a starting point. You can see that right in the description of the activity level - "active" might say something like "exercise 3-5 days per week". Well, obviously you are not burning the same number of calories with 3 days of exercise as you are with 5 days of exercise. You pick whatever estimate you want to start with. Unless you never get off the couch, most people are probably ok to start with "moderate". Get a scale and weigh your food so you actually know how many calories you are eating. Guessing is always wrong. Weigh yourself and log your weight. If you aren't losing/maintaining/gaining in line with your goals after a couple of weeks, adjust your calories up or down. You are not going to have any massive change to your weight in any direction in 2 weeks, so this is a safe way to do it and it is the most accurate way to do it since everyone's body responds differently to calories and activity.
*Decomposing* fish are smelly, not healthy living fish.  That's also why high quality seafood stores should smell like...nothing, pretty much. Seafood that "smells fishy" is not fresh.
Stomach acid is one of many processes your digestive system uses to break materials down into their nutrients. Even if you chew your food really well, it does no good to have bits of steak floating in your blood. It has to be dissolved so all that's left are the tiny nutrients your body can absorb. It normally doesn't hurt you because your digestive system produces a tough mucus layer that resists the acid. Stomach acid can't eat through *everything*, and it takes it a little time to dissolve stuff. Your body makes more of that layer, hopefully faster than the acid eats through it.  Normally, your stomach produces just a little acid, lets it do its work, then lets it pass on through the rest of the system. But a lot can go wrong. If your body doesn't maintain that mucus layer properly, the stomach acid *can* start working on your tissue. That can be a cause of stomach ulcers, and treatment can involve avoiding foods that make your body produce more acid. Similarly, if the stomach is too full or too much acid is produced, acid can get pushed further up the digestive tract into your esophagus. The mucus layer isn't present that far up the digestive tract, so it can be damaged by the acid. This is more or less "acid reflux" and it can be pretty painful. People prone to it have to be careful not to overeat, not to eat too close to bedtime, and avoid foods that make them produce too much acid.  So it sort of *can* dissolve you from the inside out. But it's a lot slower than you might think, and it hurts so bad you're really likely to go to a doctor and get treatment before it gets to the point that you need emergency surgery.
Its Double damage. The Cells in your hands are already dealing with the cold being "too much", so any additional pain gets excellerated. Basically, If you have a Tiny cut on your Hand and you touch that part? Extra pain.  Now instead of being a visible wound, its invisible, because we cant see "cold damage". (If you wanna fix it, warm your hands up and use some Hand Lotion once they dont feel frozen anymore. That will help your cells along "recharge" quicker)
Between 13 and 25 your body is a hormone rage playground. Those hormones help you go thru puberty, grow to adult size, and form your brain. They also cause the pores to become over active, causing sweat and stuff.  After 25, hormones start to balance out, until your mid 30s when they start to drop.
Birds are incredibly efficient fliers, so calories matter more for keeping warm. They puff the feathers on their bodies trapping air and using their skin to warm it up. They also have lower body temperature than mammals do so less calories are needed to warm them up. They also, if flocking birds, huddle together for warmth, bask in the sun and find little holes to live in during the winter.  Birds like robins actually fly South so they end up in places that they can tolerate.
There is no one size fits all. Some people throw up the night of. Some people throw up the morning after. Some people get the runs. Some people get a pounding headache.
Your body functions best when it maintains the right balance of salt and water. This is why hospitals hydrate people with saline solution instead of pure filtered water. Add too much water without a comparable amount of salt and it throws off the balance. *Extract* too much water without a comparable amount of salt and it also throws off the balance. If your sweat didn’t contain salt, then by sweating you would be concentrating the salt in your body, which ultimately wouldn’t be very good for you.
so there's a difference between **food poisoning** and **foodborne illness.** in food poisoning, the bacteria grew in the food, and released toxins into the food. So what makes you sick is the bacterial toxins  that are already in the food when you eat it. In many cases, cooking won't eliminate the toxins, but it will kill the bacteria.That's going to make you sick very quickly. Foodborne illness is when there are bacteria or viruses in the food, which cause an infection in your digestive system when you eat it. That takes longer, because the bacteria have to mutiply inside you before the symptoms start. Salmonella and E. Coli are examples of this. The symptoms sometimes don't show up until several days later, and they tend to last longer.
I work out 7 days a week most weeks, all weight training. My legs used to be jelly for days after lifting, but even when I push 450+ on my squats and DLs I don't get sore or weak anymore. Caveat being if I go up a few flights of stairs. Basically, blood flow to your muscles increases when you use them for strenuous exercise. Blood flow promotes healing and recovery. If you stay hydrated and keep lifting, you generally won't get soreness afterwards. Unless you're regularly increasing your weight.
Because you're focusing on it. Your brain is quite good at filtering out information that it doesn't need. For example your nose is constantly in your vision but your brain choses to ignore it since it's not useful information. By focusing on that single sound you force your brain to pay less attention to other noises.
1 hat 2 hats, it's all the same. For real though, a doctor has a doctorate in the medical field and is able to be responsible for higher functions and responsibilities. A nurse has less schooling and isn't able to fulfill the same role but can still cover a large basis or duties to keep the medical field rolling. Doctors did more school so they can do more at work.
"why" is a misleading word in lots of sciences, biology especially. It presumes a definite purpose, when the possibility remains that whatever trait you're looking at is the result of random mutation, with no specific preference for what actually occured. We don't know if 1 lunged animals would be fine, because the only way that we know it happened was with two.
Fats (or more properly, triglycerides) are made of a glycerol backbone with three fatty-acid tails attached to it.  To metabolize fats, the acid tails are broken off the backbone, rearranged by enzymes, and [reacted with oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_oxidation) to form acetyl CoA, one of the molecules involved in the usual process of burning sugar. That acetyl CoA can then enter the Krebs cycle (aka citric acid cycle), where [it goes through a series of reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle#/media/File:Citric_acid_cycle_with_aconitate_2.svg) that produce ATP, the main short-term energy storage molecule in the body. The complete list of reactions is, as is usually the case in biochemistry, enormous.
It doesn't "know" that but only animals that are immune or develop an immunity will survive to pass on their snake-hunting behavior to their offspring and continue their species. Meanwhile, animals that aren't immune and avoid said snakes will pass on their snake-avoiding behavior to their offspring.
Raising hair or fur, like we used to have has a few uses; 1) it traps a layer of still air near your skin acting as an additional layer of insulation.  2) makes you seem bigger. If you get a scare it can be a good idea to make yourself look big. 3) frisson. This is what happens when you enjoy music and get goosebumps. We're not 100% sure what exactly is the relationship between goosebumps and enjoying music or good movie scenes but it's basically because the part of your brain that enjoys music is right next to the part that keeps an eye out for danger. 4)taking a shit. Again, as far I know we don't exactly know why but it could be due to the slight but sudden temp drop when taking a piss or shit.
The exoskeletons contain a carotenoid called astaxanthin. Carotenes are pigments, and astaxanthin is the same carotene that gives salmon its color. When crustaceans are uncooked, the astaxanthin pigments are hidden because they are covered with protein chains; these protein chains give the shells their bluish-gray color. Heat destroys the protein coating, and when the animals are cooked, the astaxanthin molecules are released, thus changing the color of the crustaceans.
Basically the same as with internal prosthetics. They go in the coffin and get taken out with the bones after the body had enough time to decompose. Fun fact: It’s kind of common for cemetery workers to steal prosthetics here in Portugal as they are (or used to be) made of rare metals like platinum.
Only some control of that stuff goes through the spine, you also have the vagus nerve that controls a lot of it. Then the heart and digestion can function with no connections to anything at a basic level.    breathing is the hardest, and paralyzed people can require breathing assistance. But it takes a pretty bad injury and is the type you are mostly likely to die from immediately, it absolutely happens but there is some amount of selection bias where the people that make it to live as a paralyzed person got injuries that are somewhat survivable.
Because the body can't digest it, the body needs to be able to convert the calories in the substance and petroleum isn't a human food substance.
I don't think your premise is totally accurate, there's just such a huge spectrum of animals involved and you're over simplifying it. Aside from mosquitoes, can you suggest an overly aggressive female insect with an innocuous male counterpart? I can tell you that female hyenas are terrifying and I wouldn't want to cross a mama Grizzly either. I think the trend you might seeing is this- Insects don't raise their young (again a generalization) it's typically a give birth to thousands of babies and hope for the best situation. Where as mammals tend to raise a small number of offspring for a long(ish) period of time. In this case, the evolutionary trend would be for insects to reproduce as much as possible, so males are just sperm machines and females and just egg machines. Producing sperm is pretty cheap and easy, producing thousands of eggs is nutritionally intense. So female insects will require a lot of nutrient rich food and female mosquitos, for example, feed on blood because it contains tons of sugar and protein for eggs. Male mosquitos do not feed on blood, they just fly around impregnating as many females as possible. Mammals on the other hand raise their young, which is often done by the females. That essentially takes the females out of hunting/food gathering role, as they are focusing on raising offspring. So the males are simply "out there" where people will see them while the females might be in burrow or somewhere out of sight. But this is really broad and should not be taken as a universal insight, each animal is unique.
Explaining neurotransmitters like you're 5 is basically impossible, even when making huge concessions. There's a few reasons for this: 1. That compounds like dopamine play an enormous number of roles in your body. Not only the typical "reward pathways", but also general mood, digestion, lactation, kidney filtration rate and even immune function. Explaining how and why it acts in all of these places is an entire semester of university. 2. Dopamine, like most neurotransmitters, is affected by positive and negative feedback loops, depending on context and receptor type. This means in some cases (like reward pathways) the more often the pathway is stimulated, the more dopamine is required to stimulate it next time. While in instances like general mood or lactation, the exact opposite can occur... Up to a point (then receptor downregulation plays a role and we're back into too complicated again. 3. Dopamine response and production varies significantly from person to person and even, as suggested above, over time within the same person. The action of dopamine depends on the state of receptors and can be surprisingly variable, even if the basic functions are constant (see 1.) 4. We don't fully understand it! Most neurotransmitter effects are inferred based on drugs that behave like a certain transmitter and our observations on what those drugs do. We play a lot of "guess-and-check" when it comes to chemicals in the brain, especially those related to things as subjective as mood. I know this is very wordy for a "non answer", but I feel like it's important to understand why you may find answers to this question either oversimplified, unsatisfactory or overcomplicated; it's just the nature of this area of biology.
Life isn't just an on/off state at the cellular level, it's a combination of factors and processes all coming together. But the simplest answer to your question is probably the individual molecular level. So DNA broken down in to component bases, enzymes into their component amino acids, etc. At that point you have organic compounds but no structure that enables them to perform any particular function or role.
To the other explanations offered already, I would like to add that until relatively recent human history, our feet were heavily callused from walking barefoot all day. The large amount of nerve endings may be there to feel important ground features through a thick layer of calluses.
The back of the skull is not great for protection compared to the front, and there's lots of very delicate brain and spine parts in the skull. Because of that, punching the back of the head damages the delicate brain and spine parts more than getting punched in the front of the head. Getting hit really hard in the front and sides of the head can also cause brain damage, so it's not unique to the back of the head. There's a lot of ways that the brain can be damaged from being hit or twisted, these are called traumatic brain injuries or TBIs. One pretty well-known type of TBI is called a concussion, but there's lots.
This is subjective and you can’t get a straight answer. I for one enjoy a cold glass of water first thing when I wake up.
We have no built-in knowledge of any language. With no other humans around speaking a language, you wouldn’t know any human languages.  You do, however, have a genetic drive to learn to walk. As long as you had no disability, you would likely be walking on two legs.
Lack of sleep causes the blood vessels under the skin of our eyes to dilate, which causes an increase in blood flow. The skin under our eyes is quite thin, so the dark circles that you notice are nothing but the increased volume of blood under the skin.
I'm not sure what you think DNA looks like. But it's just a chemical, like H2O or CO2. DNA is just a lot more complex and everyone's DNA is different. Those letters are just ways to *describe* what makes up a DNA it's not like those letters are literally there. To be specific, C is cytosine, G is guanine, A is adenine, T is thymine. Those are just the 4 different chemicals that make up DNA. We could have picked any letters. Just like how I could describe a person as AALLHT Arm, arm, leg, leg, head, torso.
Radiation will break apart the DNA of a healthy cell, which then creates a colony of mutated cells within the body. If you expose that colony to more direct radiation you will both destroy the DNA and prevent it from being able to multiply as well as damage the cell structure itself and kill it.
We only use about 20-30% of the oxygen, and also it’s usually to shock there body into breathing or clearing water of some sort.
I’m not an expert but I think it has more to do with being able to slow down your heartbeat and other bodily functions so as to slow down oxygen consumption rather than having more lungcapacity. Also, you can train your lungs. People who play musical instruments that require your lungs to make sounds generally have bigger lungs I believe.
I think you might be mixing up words. I think what you're referring to is known as "lab created meat." This is meat that the cells were grown in a lab and was never part of a living animal. They essentially grew muscle tissue in a petri dish.  Physically, it's the same as the meat that comes from an animal. If we got lots of people to eat it and lots of labs to grow it, then it would be a game changer.
Proteins are super long chains of amino acids, right? They're not just limo strings though, they're all folded up in really conplex ways, and it seems that the structure of the folding contributes to how they function. It's not random (a given protein always folds the same way, unless something goes wrong), but **what exactly governs how a protein folds upon being created is unknown**. Presumably it has to do with the order of amino acids, but we currently have no way to predict how a given amino acid chain will fold. This means we can't really know how a hypothetical protein will interact unless we physically make one and look at it. The ability to predict protein folding on paper alone would speed up biomedical research exponentially.  I may be wrong but I believe Alzheimer's was revently linked to a particular protein folding wrong, and causing some sort of damage.
Less than ideal sound quality as others have mentioned, plus all the sounds are coming from the same location, the speaker cones, so you lose the ability to differentiate the direction each sound is coming from in real life.
They don't. It's a bit of an urban myth that the type of alcohol affects the type of drunk. The differences are more person to person or situation to situation (you will typically behave differently if you're chugging beers at a sports game compared to sipping whisky in a hotel bar compared to slamming shots in a club or whatever. This difference is almost entirely situational and not because different alcohol gets you different drunk)
When you blink, your eyelids push out dried tears, mucus, oils, dirt, and dead cells. When you sleep, you don't blink, so these substances build up in the corners of your eye and form a crust.
Age and lack of fluids make cramps more likely and poor circulation to the calf make it a likely location for them to occur https://youtu.be/aieh2yn4Auw
When you "choke", it is because something other than air has entered your lungs. This can be a piece of food or aspirated liquid that you've inhaled (including saliva).  Coughing expels air and foreign material from your lungs, so you're not actually clearing your "throat"/esophagus, but rather trying to force out whatever has entered your lungs through your trachea/windpipe.
Habanero tastes sweet because it is sweet. According to a quick Google search, there's about about 2-3g of sugar per 100g of habanero chili.
Maggots are just baby flies, and their eggs are laid in dead bodies by the adults who are drawn to the smell of rotting meat. Once the meat is all gone they fly somewhere else and eat something new. Of course, flies don't live long at all so certainly some don't make it to another meal.
You're probably crashing off all the sugar. Unless you're drinking really sugary coffee drinks too that'd be my guess.
Calories are a measure of the elements of food that our cells burn for energy - carbohydrates, proteins and fats, mostly. Some things we consider food contain none of these molecules (or so few that companies are legally allowed to round them down to 0) and are instead comprised entirely of other things. These may be things we can't digest, like fibre, or things that our cells can't use for energy, like vitamins.
Waste products from your body processing the drug can be found in your urine. For a real eli5 comparison, if you look super close at your poop you might see remnants of what you ate. Corn is a famous one. That's the waste product from your body processing the food. You can tell, to a certain extent, with just your eye what you've eaten. Drug tests are more sophisticated and look for specific chemicals that are left over when your body processes drugs.
I’m not exactly sure what you mean by scratching sounds, but our brains usually react to anything between 2000-5000Hz as unpleasant.  The amygdala modulates the auditory cortex whenever we hear sounds in this range; which is the most sensitive to our ears.  We aren’t sure why, but we can make a safe guess that it’s something evolutionary and primal.  The best fleshed theory I’ve read is that it’s the range in which most human screams fall, which we find unpleasant for a number of reasons.
Why do you drown if you go underwater for too long?  Your ancestors lived in the oceans.   You are not your ancestors.  You're different.  You have adapted to a different environment.
Imagine a jug of water. If you shake it up when it is full, it might make some noise but not too much. Now imagine the same jug but with only a small amount of water in it, when you shake it the jug will make a lot more noise. This isn’t a perfect analogy, but basically it’s the churning of your stomach that you are hearing and when there’s no food in there there is nothing to dampen that sound.
Not everyone absorbs or burns calories with the same efficiency. And people also have varying levels of hunger hormones.
We actually have more than 5 senses but those are just the main encompassing ones.  Thermoception, Proprioception, Nociception are a few others but they kinda fall under the other categories
The “m” in mRNA stands for “messenger”.  So, your DNA never actually leaves the nucleus of the cell.  The parts of the cell that express the genes and make the proteins are outside the nucleus.  So, the mRNA is the go between.  It “copies” a sequence from DNA, then moves out into the rest of the cell.  The mechanisms in the cell then take that “message” and turn it into a protein, meaning the gene is “expressed”.  Therapies that target mRNA to treat genetic diseases try and stop the message from getting read, stopping the cell from making the incorrect protein.  The latest vaccines that are mRNA (Pfizer/Moderna) contain the mRNA sequence Covid has to make its specific protein.  Traditional vaccines contain dead viruses, or specific pieces of dead viruses, so your body can learn to recognize the proteins as bad and develop immunity to kill it right away.  mRNA vaccines just have the gene sequence, which your own protein production mechanisms make, then from there your body recognizes it as bad and kills it.
There is a number of bones in your nose that helps it keep its structure. You can feel this when touching your nose both on the outside and the inside. The bones are able to move a bit against each other since they are not completely attached to each other which gives your nose a bit of movement. However if you move it too far or in the wrong direction it will end up breaking some of the bones in your nose. It will heal and the broken bones will fuse together over time. This will actually start quite quickly and the bones will start to fuse back again after just a few minutes. The problem is that the bones will just fuse together as they currently are and will not recover back to their original possition on their own. So it is not uncommon for people with broken noses who have not gotten medical treatment for it to end up with a misalligned nose as the bones fused together in the wrong possition. In addition to the appearance this may also cause the nose to be partially blocked and may also increase the risk of breaking the nose again in the future. It is possible to fix a nose that healed together improperly but this does involve breaking it again. Then you can follow the correct first aid procedure of putting the bones back into place and spline them there until they heal. This is also not exclusive to broken noses as all bones will have the ability to grow back together crookidly after they break.
If you cooked it you’re already used to the smell of it. That can reduce the sense of taste
Nausea is a natural response to gastrointestinal distress such as food poisoning (among many other things). Your body's first response is to purge the contents of your stomach by vomiting, which nausea usually precedes.  During this time, your body obviously doesn't want to ingest any food, which can manifest as an aversion to the thought, smell, taste, or sight of food.
Not going too much into the scientificy details, mainly because I don't remember them from high school  2 decades ago, but basically the cell division that occurs to form the reproductive cells (sperm/eggs) in humans is not the same as the cell division for none reproductive cells.  When the "normal" cells split, they create complete copies of each chromosome pair (your DNA is made of pairs of each chromosome. One comes from the father, one from the mother), so the child cells end up with a complete set of DNA.  Reproductive cells split the chromosome pairs. The child cells only receive one chromosome from each pair. In the case of the sex chromosome pair, a male has an XY pair and a female has an XX pair. So when a male creates reproductive cells (sperm), one sperm will receive the X chromosome and the other will have the Y chromosome.
Your DNA is a mixture of both your parents. Your DNA does not match your father, it matches \*half\* your father. Your brother's DNA matches \*half\* your father's DNA. But it's not the same half because each sperm has an essentially random half of the parent's DNA. On average, you and your brother should match about 1/4 of your DNA with each other. It could be anywhere from 0 to 100% though.
A way to fix the pancreas of someone with diabetes. If it’s type two and still in the early stages, improving your diet and exercise can slow down or reverse the progression of it in some people so that might be somewhat of a “cure”.
If your brain runs out of "I'm tired" juice while you're sleeping, the damn thing goes ahead and makes more. This is fine if you continue the cycle and wake up when the juice runs out, before it can start making more, but if you happen to wake up while theres still sleepy juice in the old noggin, you're fucked.
One of the reasons for whooshing or ringing in the ears is the blood rushing about your head.
It's not just carbs that results in obesity. The average person in the US consumes a huge amount of snacks, fat, carbs and refined sugars The avg US citizen drinks 38.87 gallons of cola per person per year, while in France it's 16 liters per year (4 gallons) so 1/10 as much. Portions in the US are also larger on average. Plates in the US are larger on average than in Europe because Americans eat more.  Look at the American staple MacDonalds as an example as well. A medium sized MacDonalds drink in the US is the size of an extra large in France.
Insulin is not easy to manufacture and methods of production have been held under patent law, however they recently have found different way to bio-synthesize insulin which DIY insulin makers are free to try.
Fat is an extremely effective form of energy storage. It's hard to get rid of because it stores sooo much energy. You'd have to completely stop eating for a day or two to burn off a pound of fat. The common number is a pound of fat is 3500-4000 calories, but that's complicated.  If you want to do the excercise route, you'd have to walk a mile to burn 100 calories (running doesn't burn a whole lot more, but you get it done faster :P ). For comparison, that's half a Snickers bar. Edit: to add to this a bit, there's very good reason to excercise beyond short term calorie burning. There's health benefits beyond just calorie usage. Edit 2: electric boogaloo: since people keep bringing this up, running burns maybe 50% more than walking depending on what speeds you categorize as running and walking. This is *per mile*. If you run twice as fast as you walk, you're at least doubling your calories burned per hour.
Tons of studies are being done about this currently. It has been widely accepted that venom is spread through the lymphatic system rather than the bloodstream. There might be a snake or two out there where that isn’t true.
Has to do with some primitive functions of the brain. In order to stay alive, being happy and sad helps. For ancient man, being sad motivated them to try to better the situation and to seek happy. Someone who is happy is likely safe.someone sad is less safe. The brain secrets certain chemicals when you are happy. The brain really wants these. The more of these the better. Here is an example. If you are hungry, less of these happy chemicals will be going on. Your a little sadder because you are hungry. Or there will be a lack of sad. When you eat, your brain sees that as a happy thing and there will be happy chemicals. Your brain learns the act of eating is a happy thing. There for you eat when you are hungry. The brain learns the things that trigger happy chemicals. For some riding a roller coaster create a state of euphoria. Even though it looks dangerous. That's why some people really like to ride roller coasters.  So down the things that seem interesting. Depending on how your brains sense of happy triggers and sad triggers, certain things will seem interesting because they may meet a complex array of criteria which the brain associates with happy triggers. This you will be interested in those things because it's more likely to cause a happy trigger. In a very layman's type explanation   at least.
both. rivers were cleaner and their guts were used to this. that being said while it's generally a good idea not to drink straight from a big river or a lake of brown brackish water, drinking from a clean spring is generally safe (at least where I live).
Yes, they almost always have relative color sight and many people with mild color blindness don't know they're color blind until they're adults and get tested. Just makes it harder to distinguish certain colors as they view them as being nearly the same
It's a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's resulting in a lower frequency of severe disease/hospitalizations/deaths, which is a good thing on paper. But on the other hand, the sheer number of infections and it's capacity to spread and evade immune responses more effectively could (and has a good chance to) result in more *overall* instances of severe disease/hospitalizations/deaths. To illustrate with hypothetical numbers: if Delta only infected 100 out of 100,000 people, but those 100 infections resulted in 20 hospitalizations, then 20% of positive cases are resulting in a hospital bed occupation. Let's say Omicron infects 1000 out of 100,000 people, but only 10% of those infections resulted in hospitalizations: that would result in 100 people being hospitalized, 5x more than Delta in the same population despite the instances of severe disease being half the frequency of Delta.  The communicability and immune evasion of the virus are two things to be weighed in addition to the severity of the disease it illicits because we only have a finite number of hospital beds/staff/resources to help those infected. Moreover, the fuller our hospitals are with COVID patients, the less availability there is in said hospitals for other patients. This is just one approach (again, with hypothetical numbers) to examining why Omicron is still such a concern despite it resulting in a lower frequency of severe disease. Hope it helps, stay well.
As bromelain breaks down the proteins on the surface of your lips, tongue, and cheeks, it can leave your mouth feeling raw or numb. Your stomach can break down bromelain.
After really violently crying when I’m upset, I get bruises above my eyelids. There’s a lot of pressure from how I hold my cheeks. However, smiling while scrunching my eyes shut like that causes the pressure to move outward, scrunching around my eyes and folding the skin along the smile lines. This difference in pure compression above the eyelid versus compression and tension outside the eye certainly is why crying from laughter won’t cause bruising, so I would assume that also contributes to to the difference of swelling versus not swelling. It’s probably not the whole story, but it’s something.
A vein is a blood vessel that carries blood back to the heart, while an artery carries blood away from the heart. An artery will be at high pressure compared to a vein. If you just want to refer to the tubes that carry blood then you should say blood vessels. To address your question, blood from the heart is split up into smaller and smaller vessels until it reaches capillaries and just sort of oozes through tissue. Every living cell will need a blood supply which is to say the ability to directly bump against a blood cell, so blood needs to be able to go everywhere in the body. So in a sense yes, you are a skin sack full of blood, although it is much more complicated than that.
Firstly, to actually enter a blood vessel it would have to be shoved in really hard. Your blood vessels are pressurized like a big long skinny balloon, which is why blood comes out of a wound even if you hold it above your head instead of just kind of dripping out when gravity demands it. Secondly, in such an event, it would act as a clot. Eventually it would find a blood vessel too narrow to pass through and clog that spot. If you’re lucky, it’s a very small blood vessel in your finger or something and you only experience a bit of necrosis before it’s pulled out with the dead tissue. If it’s a larger rough piece it could ricochet around in your blood vessels causing tears in arteries and then clog most/all blood from reaching something important like your left kidney or a substantial region of your brain.
Everything causes changes to our brain. You just reading this comment causes chemical changes in your brain. 100 billion brain cells...and the neural connections in the brain may be between 100 trillion to 1000 trillion..so yeah everything we experience changes our brain that little bit. Honestly this is still a relatively little understood topic even with the advances made so far.
When animals evolved from single celled organisms to multicelled organisms we lost the enzymes required to make B12. We do not know exactly why this is. However it is one of the most complicated molecule to make requiring lots of steps and a lot of energy. However you do not need very much of it. So it might have been advantageous of early creatures to get B12 from consuming bacteria rather then producing it themselves. We still retain a few of the enzymes required to make B12 as these are also used to make other molecules like hemoglobin and chlorophyll which are structurally similar. However the final and more complicated enzymes does not exist in the DNA any more.
Well as a metaphor look at the vietnam war. Just having more dudes and material on your side doesn't guarantee that you win in the end. The most critical part of the immune system is the coordination. Recognizing what is a pathogen and what isn't (false alarms are basically allergies, and potentially deadly). Also tailoring the answer to the pathogen in question. The general purpose part of your immune system is good to buy time, but the fight is won by specialists produced to fight exactly this threat. If just producing more defenders would increase your chance of survival then your body would do that. Deseases have always been a major force in natural selection.
Breakdown of trust between the Government,the pharmaceutical industry and the general public.Lots of nuance is lost in this conversation also as like most topics nowadays they are being polarised to the extreme ends of the spectrum.
What feels comfortable is largely based on what you are used to. If you are used to a bad posture, your body adjusts itself to feel normal and comfortable at it. Basically your muscles and tendons adjust themselves in to this stance by getting weaker, stronger, longer or shorter, this happens automatically based on amounts of stress they are subjected to. I used to have a really bad posture, it was comfortable until I got problems from it. Then I corrected my posture and it is just as comfortable now that I'm used to it. It does even need thought to be put in to it to keep it. It is all about what you are used to. But I have physically demanding jobs, and you simply cannot do them with bad posture. You start to correct your posture unconsciously just to get the work done. Things like using your core and such. Your body will last longer when it is used the way it mechanically works. Also you can get lot more power and endurance when you use it correctly. Things like walking long distances get easier. (Which you should do, does wonders for your posture and back)
They absolutely can. Anyone who says otherwise is lying to you or just never thought about it.
Because they don’t go through medical school, they don’t complete the same level of scientific and medical training, and they don’t learn about all the body systems in the same level of detail as a DO or MD does. Some of them have a masters or DPT, in which case they actually are “real doctors.”
Some ants will die without their specific colony as other colonies will reject them or see them as enemies. Some species of ants will cooperate with other colonies of the same species, and are considered a "supercolony", and those ants could join up with another colony if they find one of the same species. https://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Supercolonies
The developing embryo knows how large (with some margin of error) to develop itself, no matter what the starting conditions are. The initial split can be resolved in less than a day; cellular division is a very fast process, so it takes very little time to make up that difference so that both the twin-embryos are about the same size as a non-twin embryo.
So, there's some basic biochemistry to be known here. The interesting thing about sodium (which is one part of salt) is that wherever it is, water will flow *towards* it. So, if you load up your blood with a lot of salty water, the water that's already in your cells leaves and enters your bloodstream to balance the concentration, leaving you dehydrated. Left long enough, it can kill you.
That is actually still a topic for debate. It is generally assumed that at some point simple chemistry of self replicating molecules turned into life. We think that the very first life was RNA based not DNA based as you and I are. There is some debate exactly where that happened. Tidal pools were a popular location for a long time, but deep sea vents are also a serious possibility. There is also the whole panspermia theory (don't laugh that is what it is called). The idea that life didn't get started here on earth at all, but rather was contaminated by asteroids that contained some primitive life that originated elsewhere. The idea that life got started out there does nothing to help solve the problem of how life got started int he first place and merely moves the problem to another location, but it has huge implications for the chances of findign life elsewhere.
Plants begin to turn yellow when they are weakened or stressed, which tells bugs that it's time to chow down. Keep in mind that yellow lights and paint and clothes or any other artificial yellow objects are all relatively modern creations in comparison to the hundreds of millions or even billions of years that plants and insects have been around, and their tiny bug brains haven't evolved so they can tell the difference between a yellow hat and a yellowing plant.
For the sake of simplicity let's say you are able to eat the chips in a single bite. In that instant you will increase in mass by 500g.  As soon as you eat them you will begin losing weight because you're breathing contains water and other gases, each breath makes you lighter. You begin to digest the chips which takes energy, and breathing, heart beat, maintaining temp etc. also takes energy, so some of the calories will be used in these processes. Unused absorbed calories  (if there are any) will end up being stored as fat. At some point you will excrete the undigestable components of the chips along with a portion of your gut bacteria which will also reduce your mass.
Evolution. Individuals who "don't feel the need" don't reproduce and thus don't pass on their "don't feel the need" genes.  It's the ones with the "feel the need" genes who pass on their genes and thus most organisms will "feel the need" because they are the descendants of those who "feel the need" and thus have inherited their genes. Most people have this view of evolution that it's about individuals when in reality it's more about genes.  If a mutation makes an organism's life horrible but increases the odds of it successfully reproducing then you'll end up with a bunch of miserable organisms.
There are many factors to stamina, but the main one is the ability of the lungs and heart, i.e. the cardiovascular system, to get oxygen to the rest of your body. Cardiovascular exercise, like running, improves the efficiency of that system by strengthening the heart and increasing blood volume
I think Koalas might have something to say about that. They have a huge epidemic of chlamydia right now.
You can become diabetic even if you're not fat, being fat just means your health has slid to where it's more likely. But, as with everything, too much is bad for you. Whether you're fat or not.
Hunger is caused by the contracting of muscles in the stomach lining when the stomach is devoid of solids and mostly devoid of liquid. There are a few different hormones which may signal this process. Satiety (the feeling of being full) is defined as the absence of hunger. Putting food in an empty stomach gives the muscles in its lining something to squeeze that isn’t just acid and gas bubbles, and the feeling of hunger goes away after a few minutes, making you feel satiated or “full”
Yes, there's always a 50/50 chance (more or less, theoretically) that any child will be male or female. The sex of the children of your relatives has no bearing on the sex of your children.
There are two separate definitions: botanical and culinary. The botanical definitions is pretty strict: fruit is the fleshy, seed bearing part of the plant. Vegetable doesn't have a botanical definition. The culinary definition is somewhat vague. Fruit is usually a juicy part of the plant that you would drink or eat as dessert, while vegetable is part of the plant that you eat as part of a savory dish.
A child doesn't speak any language when it's born, it only learns the language spoken around it. So if the father speaks spanish and spends more time with the child than the mother, the child might prefer to speak spanish. If the parents gave the child up for adoption immediately after birth, and it got adopted to Japan, it would start speaking japanese.
Breast milk is indeed an amazing substance.  It contains all the macro and micro nutrients a human baby needs, in exactly the right proportions to support their development.  Evolution has optimized it over eons to be the ideal food for a baby.  Everyone recommends it as what a baby should be consuming, without anything else, for the first 6 months of life. That said, not every mother can breast feed her child that way.  Formula is an attempt to produce a synthetic substance which mimics breast milk.  It's made through a very different process, and those chemicals are just the "recipe" used to try and get the right molecules in the right relationships.  They are included on the labeling because there is a law requiring that, not because most mothers have the chemistry background to understand them.
Many traditional chemotherapy drugs work by breaking some part of the DNA replication process. This has the advantage of only hurting a cell when it tries to copy its DNA, so cells which never do that aren't affected at all. Nerves, for instance, don't copy themselves, and are therefore immune to these chemo drugs. However, the most aggressive cancers are literally always copying their DNA. As a result, breaking that process will break a greater percentage of their cells than any others in the body, killing the cancer faster than you. This is also why chemo is bad for sperm and white blood cell count. Both are rapidly replicating cells, so both will be heavily impacted.
They do get twisted and it hurts like HELL: Testicular torsion occurs when a testicle rotates, twisting the spermatic cord that brings blood to the scrotum. The reduced blood flow causes sudden and often severe pain and swelling.  Testicular torsion is most common between ages 12 and 18, but it can occur at any age, even before birth. Testicular torsion usually requires emergency surgery. If treated quickly, the testicle can usually be saved. But when blood flow has been cut off for too long, a testicle might become so badly damaged that it has to be removed.
Hypoallergenic doesn't mean there's no allergic reactions possible, it means that the risks are minimized. So they use fewer allergens than they would otherwise making an equivalent product.
To bengal tigers, they each look quite different from each other. You, a human, are trained to differentiate one human from another since birth. If you grew up in a society of bengal tigers, you’d be good at telling them apart, too. The bengal tigers are good at telling each other apart, for the same reason.
>1) What makes the cones coloursensitive? They have different proteins that have different response to different wavelengths. The light actually gets absorbed by a small molecule called retinal, lodged inside the protein. That molecule normally has a bend in the middle, but the energy from a photon can convert it to a straight form. That change in shape pushes on the protein around it, and the protein's change of shape allows it to send a signal to other proteins and trigger the response to light. The protein bits around the retinal molecule change the chemical environment subtly, which is enough to make it absorb slightly different wavelengths of light. Since each cone cell only makes a specific protein, it can be used to discriminate color. >2) Why can we perceive something like yellow either by a specific wavelength or by mixing multiple wavelengths (red and green)? There's actually a lot of overlap in how the proteins absorb different wavelengths. "Yellow" comes when the cone cells that make the green protein and the ones that make the red protein both get activated. That can either be caused by light that's right in between their peak wavelengths ("real" yellow) or a mix of the two wavelengths they each respond best to (mix of green and red). There's no way for our visual system to tell those scenarios apart, it just measures how much signal each type of cone is generating. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopsin#/media/File:Cone-response-en.svg) is a picture of how the cone cells (and the rods) respond to color. The red and green cells are really very close together, it's almost wrong to call them red and green.
Both beef and turkey can potentially contain many harmful pathogens and/or parasites, but what is interesting about beef is that these parasites only exist at the surface level, the part of the meat exposed to the air.  This is because beef flesh is a very dense meat and it’s difficult for the pathogens to spread throughout.  So a fresh steak only needs to have the surface layer fully cooked to minimize infection risk. This is also why rare steak is fine but ground hamburger must be further cooked.  If the meat is ground then that surface yuck has been mixed throughout the result. Chicken, and turkey on the other hand, are softer meats and the bacteria present in them typically penetrate a lot farther than the surface.  For this reason they have to be cooked fully to kill all of the pathogens and be made safe for eating. Think about how when there is mold on a hard cheese, You can just scrape the moldy part off and be fine, but with soft cheeses like Brie or ricotta they must be trashed immediately if they mold (not talking about the mold used to flavor it).
The body does not kill bacteria with fever. The body kills bacteria with Leukocytes (White blood cells) and Antibodies (proteins that bind to the outer membrane of bacteria and clump them together / inactivate them or incapacitate them). The fever is there to slow down the reproduction process of the bacteria so your initial response has a better chance to be sufficient.  Your body has other peculiar responses to infection furthermore increasing it´s efficacy: you will store iron inside cells, not allowing it to be ''eaten'' by bacteria who NEED it in order to replicate. Copper levels also tend to fluctuate during infections and so on... (more about this [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29353-2))  Our body will just try and deprave itself of those ''luxuries'', not vital for itself but vital for other microorganisms. A good example of us learning to approach infections with the ''it does more harm to them than to us'' technique was the use of ARSENIC before antibiotics. Yes, it kills us... but it kills the bacteria faster. (More about it [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0251-8))
Your immune system is very multifaceted.   You’ve got lots of elements to your immune system besides fever.    Fever isn’t even your first - let alone your best - line of defence.  But it sure makes you feel rotten. When you’re sick, it’s okay to treat the symptoms of the illness to make yourself more comfortable (fever, headache, etc) because you don’t actually impact your immune system that much by doing this.   If you were sick enough that you would have a significant impact on your immune system by lowering your fever, then you would need to be in hospital.
on your body? trails and error. thats why toddlers are so clumbsy in 3d space during movement? your skin. Touch. That's one of your most important senses. Skin stretches, contracts. Pressed against, pulled on (mimicking acceleration)
It doesn’t for the most part. You can easily (and painfully) burn them off entirely.  I’m assuming you are addressing fingerprint identification. That’s using a subset of common aspects of fingerprints and then comparing tiny differences. If you slice your finger, those differences will still be there but your fingerprint as a whole will be changed.  Fingerprint identification is not an exact science and your body isn’t trying to replicate it after an injury. Blisters are subcutaneous. They are just pushing the top layers up.
I cannot figure out what you mean by this and I'm not sure if it's because of a wording issue or because you have some kind of neurological disorder and you are seeing your brain activity.
We aren’t entirely sure, researchers believe there is a genetic link to why you are right or left hand dominant, but no one has 100% found the answer. The theory for why dominant hands became a thing has two components. The first is that all motor controls have to be learned by the brain. Babies learn to sit up, to crawl, to walk, to run. At the same time they also learn how to pick stuff up, how to hold things, how to throw things. And the belief is that it is just easier for the brain to only do that and develop the pathways in the brain for one hand. You need both legs to walk, but you don’t necessarily need both arms to pick something up. The second part of the question, which is if the brain picks a dominant hand, why are the majority of people right handed?  In this case the theory is that as humans and our ancestors started learning how to make and use tools, it was evolutionarily beneficial if everyone used those tools with the same hand. Since making one set of tools that everyone can use is better than having to make multiples. But this is more of a theory is not really proven.
Your pain receptors are mostly in your skin (subcutis). They get more triggerd, when they take s hit. That's why burned skin (like back in the days sliding over the school gym floor) hurts way harderd than for example a haematom by a hard hit or a deeper wound from falling.
The same pathways in the brain are activated as if you were experiencing it in front of you. It's one reason why porn addiction exists
No. If you are eating fewer calories than you need, you'll lose weight. If you are eating more calories than you need, you'll gain. This is oversimplified but unless you're already very lean and trying to get 3% more shredded for a photoshoot, overthinking it is splitting hairs. I actually ate right before bed leading up to a bodybuilding competition every night and was still actually too lean for figure division (so I didn't place), I lost a bit too much weight. Tl;dr it doesn't matter when you eat, it matters how much you eat.
The reason “a tomato is a fruit” became the go to is due to the Supreme Court case [Nix v. Hedden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_v._Hedden)  There was an import tax which taxes “fruits” and “vegetables” differently. In an attempt to avoid higher taxes it was claimed that tomatoes are actually fruit and thus subject to lower taxes. The court found that the tax law was using common parlance for “fruits” and “vegetables” not botanical definitions. Rightly so I’m my opinion, since, as you point out, there is no botanical definition of vegetables.
Maggots hatch from tiny eggs. Flies lay the eggs in rotting meat, but they are very small and blend in really well. Once the eggs hatch into maggots it seems like they came from nowhere, but it’s just that you never noticed the eggs.
In general, the vehicle roads (highways etc.) are walled or fenced on both sides, to prevent the animals from walking into the path of the vehicles.  So basically the animals are "herded" so to speak by the fences towards the crossing bridge. And otherwise, believe it or not, animals have memory and they can learn and remember the layout of "territory", and where they can cross rivers, roads, etc.
Think of a cake. It takes a number of ingredients to make, but in the end it’s just one cake. Some ingredients are more critical than others (eggs, flour), some less critical (almond extract, pinch of salt). Now let’s add a few drops of lemon juice. Probably not going to change the cake a whole lot, is it? It will still look the same, just with a hint of lemon. But is it still the same cake? Not quite.  The consequence of genetic manipulation can be difficult to predict, which is why it’s handled by people a lot smarter than me. But small changes to non-critical genomes might do very little to change the final outcome.
People don’t just pass out, so you have to address the root cause. Low blood pressure?  Asphyxiation?  Chemical toxicity?  Head trauma? If the problem isn’t resolved quickly they may not regain consciousness and will eventually die instead.
We’d have to have viable chunks of DNA to clone one back into existence.  I do not believe there are any saved examples of these creatures’ dna.  Next you’d have to find a host creature to gestate the clone.  A lot easier said than done in practice.  Once alive it would be a only either the female or male of the species and there’s still be no way to create the mate.   So no.   Now for current animals looking at extinction we could potentially save enough material - even freeze eggs and sperm from the last of heir kind.  But the technology to fully gestate and then get those offspring clones to mate to actually restore an entire species is a bit tricky.  Artificial insemination and captive breeding programs are already underway but many of these animals simply do not produce under the stress of captivity.
It sounds like what you're describing is visual snow. It's pretty hard to research and there's not really funding to research it since it doesn't really have any significance to a person's health so we don't really understand why it happens particularly well. We currently think it originates in the brain, not the eye, and might be due to brain areas that are responsible for the early parts of visual processing being overexcitable. There are neurons in these regions that normally fire when a certain region of the eye detects light but in some people with visual snow they start to fire randomly without prompting. The static is probably a result of other parts of your brain which those early processing regions communicate with trying to interpret what is effectively random noise.
Maintaining muscles takes energy. Your body is constantly trying to save energy so muscles that aren't used just needlessly consume energy. So your body reduces them because it can't sustain them and they're obviously not needed. Which also explains why fat stays. It's energy reserves for bad times. Too bad most of the western world doesn't really have the problem of a lack of food.
This actually happened in an nba game. Not to exaggerate, Allen Iverson knew the rim was off by two inches. The refs stopped the game and everything, took at the tape measurer out and he was right.
Arteries harden over time and it’s exacerbated by poor diet and lifestyle. Your heart has to work harder to pump the blood through narrower and firmer vessels. Also obesity causes your body to make more blood vessels giving the blood further to travel which means more work on your heart. The systolic pressure is what your heart has to overcome to perfuse your tissues with oxygenated blood.
That is the problem when making a drug to cure / stop an illness. Killing the virus is never hard. NOT killing what is around the virus is. The reason chloriquin was presented as a covid killer is exactly that. The dosage that was required to kill the virus was also way about the dosage that would kill a man. But conspirationists never really wondered about it, they just assumed someone was mean and just wanted to prevent them from using a miracle drug.
>“Energy can neither be created nor destroyed”. With that being said, when life is created, like a human baby for instance, where does all the energy in the baby come from?      The raw materials to grow parts of your (or another person's) body come from the food you eat and from the air you breathe.   Most of the energy required to to appropriately re-arrange those raw materials (mostly carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen) comes from some of the chemical bonds of those materials. Originally that energy comes from the sun and is introduced into the earth's ecosystems by some organisms (mainly plants and algae) via photosynthesis, a way to convert sunlight's energy into and store it as chemical energy.
The legs have hard, tiny "hairs" (basically barb-like protrusions) that scrape against the cricket's body (which is a relatively hard, chitonius exostructure) and the resulting friction between the many "hairs" against the hard carapace creates the sound. Kinda like nails on a chalk board
If the body didn’t create a fever to try to kill it or soreness of blood rushing to areas etc. The germ would go unchecked and continue to eat your cells to make more of it. Then you would no longer be a collection of human cells you would be a bunch of germ factories. You’d be dead
You've been standing on your feet nearly your entire life, and they evolved specifically to be stood upon. Look at a thigh compared to a forearm. WAY more muscle.
Most important. Omicron is still quite new and we're still learning a lot about it.  Omicron seems a lot more contagious then Delta. So it transfers between people easier. It also looks like the vaccines dont help as much with preventing infection.  BUT most recent research seems to indicate that Omicron is on average, less severe in its severity.  The increased infection rate looks to be a bigger factor so over all, more people will suffer, sadly
It stimulates your tear ducts which help lubricate your eyes as they may be kinda dry when you wake up. I think it also stimulates some nerves by your eye which relaxes you a bit
Sometimes other things are added for the flavors, sometimes it's the ingredients in the beer/wine. For example. I'm a homebrewer. I currently have a chocolate mint stout finishing up. With this one, I added hops that have a mint profile and added more fresh mint to help bring it out more. With beers, the grains or hops are one of the main influences. Coffee, bread, and nutty flavors can come off of which grains you use and fruits/herbal additions would come from which hops you use. Some add bitterness, some add fruity, some add floral/herbal. In beers like a hefeweissen though, the yeast has a clove/banana flavor to it. In short, any beer has water, malts, hops, and yeast. The combo of which malt, hop, and yeast will change the flavor of it, but fruits, coffees, herbs, or spices CAN be added while the beer is made to help improve those flavors.
I believe it does, but the cold temperatures in the refrigerator slow it down. That's why you don't store yogurt in the pantry. Also why there is an expiration date on yogurt.
Rule 7 requires that you search the sub before posting.
I'm ftm (female-to-male), but i know a few things about MtF transitions. First i want to say,  You don't need to take hormones or have surgeries to be trans. A lot of trans people don't do hormone replacement therapy and don't get surgeries because that's how they are comfortable with their bodies.  Depending on where you live, you might need a gender dysphoria diagnosis. You can get this diagnosis by seeing a gender therapist who will evaluate you. With this diagnosis, you can see an endocrynologist, who will be allowed to give you oestrogens if you transition from male to female, but before that, you need to do some blood tests to see where your hormone levels are.  There are different ways to get oestrogens in your system. You can take pills or as injections. You will then basically go through a female puberty (growth of breasts, fat redistribution, mood swings, increase/decrease of libido, acne, etc). Some things, like a deep voice or body hair, will not get changed by the hormones. A lot of trans women either go to orthophonists to do voice training in order to get a higher voice, or they get surgeries in their vocal cords.  For the body hair and facial hair, trans women usually get them removed with lazer removal.  Some trans women also get breast implants if their natural breasts aren't big enough. These have to be changed every few years.  Finally, vaginoplasty. A lot of trans women consider this to be the end of their transition. There are different ways for a trans woman to get a vagina, but i don't know exactly how it's done.  I hope this helped :)
Your body burns calories for energy. If you consume more calories (energy) than you are using, your body stores the excess as fat. It's not any more complicated than that. If you fill up the gas tank of your car all the time but you barely drive, the tank is going to get more full and eventually overflow, right?
That's a slight difference but :  - Anticoagulants reduce the process itself, it's not always platelets - Anti platelets are targetting specifcly them
Scrubs aren't sterile, you just take them out of the clothes dryer and put them on.  It's more about ease of cleaning any mess that gets on them off without staining.
1. There are far, far fewer wheelchair athletes, so one really good athlete can dominate multiple disciplines much more easily.   2. The difference between "going all out" and "going at a speed you can maintain for a longer time" may be a lot smaller in a wheelchair than in normal running. In that case you'd expect the same athlete to win at multiple distances, since they'd be very similar.
Most of it is not actual blood. It is mostly built up tissue that lines the uterus, and then when the period happens, the body forces that tissue to slough off and be forced out of the body. Skin sloughs in a similar way, but way more often and with less effort from the body.
That's the problem. It doesnt. It hangs around in the body until it can be slowly cleared. Thats why it hurts so much and for so long.
Yes and no. Part of a treatment regimen is to address severe symptoms. Patient rest is also a part of the cure. Ensuring the comfort of the patient is also part of the treatment.  Feeling better and ensuring your body is in its best shape to fight the disease is necessary and that means treating symptoms.  Direct healing - well this is a pretty undefined statement. Generally speaking, most of the healing is done with your body's defense mechanisms. Even something like anti-biotics which can kill bacteria behaves as a bolster to the body. Is this a "cure"? Reducing a fever that could perhaps become dangerous and impact the brain? Is this a "cure"? Reducing nausea so that the person can eat and drink fairly normally while fighting a disease? Is this a "cure"?
Hemoglobin, the part of your blood that carries the oxygen, absorbs infrared light. When it carries oxygen molecules, it still absorbs Infrared light, but with a slightly changed absorbtion pattern (hemoglobin without oxygen absorbs better at shorter wavelengths). So when you measure the oxygen level, you send Infrared light through your finger and measure, how much light of a certain wavelength passes through. From the amount of absorbed light you (or the little Computer inside the device) calculate the ratio of oxygenated hemoglobin to non-oxygenated hemoglobin, i.e. oxygen saturation.
When the liver is damaged by excessive long term alcohol use it causes cirrhosis.  This causes scar tissue to form in the liver.  Scar tissue destroys that part of the liver from being able to function and this includes its ability to regenerate.
'Alcohol' describes a group of chemical compounds that are created by yeasts when they break down natural sugars in grains or fruits during a process known as 'fermentation'. There are different types of alcohol (eg ethanol, methanol and propanol) but what they all have in common is a 'hydroxyl' group, which is a chemical structure that is very effective at bonding to other molecules. This tends to dissolve the molecules that it bonds to. That's how alcohol kills microbes - by dissolving their protective membranes and then reacting with the stuff inside.
I guess you meant strongmen, as bodybuilder rarely lift very heavy (in relation to their strengths) Anyway, it is because of internal pressure. You need to hold your breath when lifting this heavy to have more strength. But, because the internal pressure is so high, some blood vessels can break, resulting in what you saw
Because it literally is uncomfortable lol. Building muscle literally is intentionally damaging/stretching the muscles so they grow more mass to repair the microtears. If you are unfit breathing is harder because your lungs are weaker and fatigue easier.
Well usually when an animal eats raw meat it’s just recently been killed and hasn’t had the time to develop harmful bacteria. We humans get our raw meat from stores that’s been handled and prepackaged and is god knows how old before you actually get around to eating it
Yeah that's called depression. I mean, I don't wanna diagnose over the internet but I'd suggest visiting a psychiatrist.
Many animals that hibernate have the ability to recycle the protein in their bodies, allowing them to delay muscle atrophy for a much longer period of time.  Other animals wake up periodically during hibernation to briefly forage and replenish their reserves before returning to hibernation.
The answers so far are either flat out false or too narrow.  If you do it a lot, it probably means you have RLS. It’s a mild disorder where if you’re not moving your legs you get a sense of discomfort, and shaking the leg removes that feeling. The cause is largely unknown, but iirc its genetic and worsened by caffeine for instance.  If you do it occasionally, it could be a form of self soothing. This happens to some people when they’re stressed or when they’re feeling anxious.  There are more causes to the leg-jig, but these are the most common as far as I know.
Ingesting marijuana by smoking it causes the effects to become apparent almost immediately, which is desirable in many cases where medical marijuana is prescribed.  This can include pain management, and anxiety management.  The faster you can stop the symptoms, the better, and inhaling marijuana smoke is the fastest way for the effects to become apparent.  It does, however, present many of the same health risks as tobacco smoke, but most users would probably say that the benefits of feeling the effects relatively quickly outweigh the damage done to the lungs and respiratory system.
No. Although at birth women will have near a million eggs, there will be about 300, 000 left at puberty and in your lifetime, you'll only ovulate about 350 of them. The exact number is different for everyone. Menopause is usually started by changing hormone levels, not egg amount. So you could have many periods over your lifetime and have a late menopause. To add a fun little edit: inside the ovaries, the immature eggs (oocytes) are housed in follicles. The oocyte grows into an ootid and eventually becomes an ovum (or egg). So every 28 days-ish, when your brain goes, hey time for babies and your brain releases GnRH (hormone), which the makes your pituitary gland release FSH (follicle stimulating hormone). Once the follicles mature, they are able to sense the FSH, however only one egg is ever released (well, mostly, don't forget about fraternal twins). So each month you can lose around 1000 oocytes.  As you get older, the eggs remaining are the older, lower quality ones. These can have abnormal chromosomes resulting in higher chances of Downs Syndrome etc.
The opposite of "severe" is "benign". The opposite of "acute" is "chronic". These words are not the opposite of each other.
First of all, Neanderthal aren't direct ancestors of modern humans.  Second of all, the barrier of species isn't always well defined, this question applies to everything. The definition of species for animals with sexual reproduction is: "two animals belong to the same species if they can have fertile offspring together". If you had sex with a Homo Erectus, you wouldn't have fertile offspring, so you're different species. Evolution is progressive and it's not like one day you have Homo Erectus and next day you have Homo Sapiens, but these gradual changes eventually make new species rise.
Fur on animals works by trapping air close to the body, where the body can heat it up to produce a thermal insulating layer. The other thing fur does, is manage water. Water can be 25x better than air at conducting heat. This means that when you are wet next to your skin. You can shed heat to the surroundings 25x faster as it evaporates from you. Fur is packed densely near the skin, and gets thinner and more spread out, as it moves futher away from the body. The fur near the skin is also impregnated with water repelling skin oils, the fur further away isn't. Sea otters have 25,000-165,000 hairs/cm2 (163,000-1,072,000 hairs/inch2) These two factors mean that water sits in the top or mid layer of fur. It evaporates from there, rather than directly from the skin. So doesn't make the animals as cold. Enough water in the mid layer can actually help trap that air thermal blanket next to the skin. An outdoor clothing company called Paramo, actually have a clothing range that is inspired by these principles. They refer to them as a directional water pump system. It's not waterproof like a Gortex, but it keeps you warm by transporting away from your body and into the top layer.
Imagine these blood types are countries, red blood cells are the citizens, and plasma is the military. Type A blood has devil horns, Type B blood has pitchforks, Type AB blood has devil horns and pitchforks, and Type O blood is just normal people. Venturing into type O territory with devil horns or pitchforks will get you killed by the plasma since you're clearly a foreign entity and could be a virus, but if type O blood ventures into any territory, they'll get a pass by the plasma because they're just normal people with no real features. This is why Type O can give blood to anyone, but their plasma will kill everyone else's blood. Venturing into type AB territory is fine though, because devil horns and pitchforks are both not foreign to them, so the plasma will let anyone in. The blood will be killed by all the other plasma though because they'd have some foreign feature.
Some people like carbonated drinks because the gas creates an extra sensation, which can make the drink more “exciting”.
First, I’ll address the tattoo question. The particles injected inside your skin by the tattoo gun are just too large. When a cell dies, it is “eaten” by cells called macrophages, and removed from the site; but there is a limit to the size of particles that the macrophages can eat. The tattoo ink (carrier + pigment) is composed of particles that are just too large for your macrophages to eat so they persist.  Scar formation has a little more complicated a process behind it, but I’ll attempt to explain simply. There are two kinds of injuries, clean injuries like those the scalpel makes and disorderly injuries that are just haphazard. The clean cuts heal very well because their edges can be pulled together to aid the healing but in the case of haphazard injuries, your body begins to respond almost immediately by sending cells to the injured normal tissue and lay down harder tissue (with collagen fibre deposition). This collagen is a protein that is also normally present but the collagen deposited in the tissue after an injury is different from normal collagen. Think of it as specialised collagen.  One more aspect. The outer layer of your skin that keeps renewing is called the epidermis. Under it is the dermis, which doesn’t renew as often and efficiently. Sometimes you may get injuries that are deep enough to reach the dermis and leave behind more permanent damage. Some scars can fade a little for up to 2 years or so but after that, they won’t anymore.  Same logic applied to tattoos, the ink is injected deep into the dermis. There are tattoo-removal services available now, which break the ink particles into smaller dust, which can then be eaten by the macrophages.  Also, it’s incorrect to say that “all the cells in the human body” are replaced in a span of 7 years. You have then heart, brain, and so on which are composed of permanent cells.
Aging is essentially just your body breaking down and wearing out. Just like with a car engine, if you use it often, or put too much strain on it it will wear out and break down faster.
You’ve got things reversed… it limits our reproductive appeal because that’s where we know to look for excess fat (and therefore implied bad health). If people got fat ears instead of fat bellies, those would be the place that we look at to judge health, and fat ears would be considered unattractive.
H2O is the building blocks to life of earth. So the simplest way to explain it is as our bodies are mostly made from water, that means our cells are made from mostly water. We lose water as a waste product, sweating and urinating etc. So we must replenish that. You can become hydrated with any drink, but water is obviously the purest form of replenishing H2O in your body.
Inside the penis is spongy tissue called corpora cavernosa.  That's what fills up with blood to make it hard.  Some people's spongy tissue doesn't expand as much.    Imagine 2 penises that are the same size when erect.  One curls up tighter when soft, and the other doesn't.  It's just a property of the corpora cavernosa which can vary.
Calories are just units of energy. The energy amount is determined based on what are called “macronutrients” which are protein, fat, carbohydrates, and alcohol. Each of these has a determined number associated to it per gram and thus when added together create the total calories. Science originally determined these numbers using a device that would literally burn the food and they would determine the amount of calories based on how long it took. Now they just reference the existing information.  So let’s say turkey is 100 calories, that total is based on how much protein, fat and carbs are in it.
For rapid access energy we store glycogen (basically carbohydrate) in the muscles and liver. This is what you burn when you do exercise, and when it runs out you "hit the wall" or "bonk". For very rapid access energy there is your blood sugar. Low blood sugar triggers the production of the hormone glucagon which signals your body to convert glycogen to sugar.
Because it’s very special cells that let us grow 2 meters. Stem cells, these are cells that have the ability to replicate into pretty much any other kind of cell in the body, that is what does most of the major crazy growing that happens in the womb. Then, as a child you continue to grow, with some stem cells but also very specialized parts of the body that are meant to grow. For example, bones have Growth Plates in them, and when the child is growing those Growth Plates are where the bones actually grow and lengthen (which means if you damage one of these, you can actually really stunt the bone growth, which is bad). But, once your a full fledged grown up human, your body is mostly all specialized cells now. This means that when you do soemthing like cut a finger off, nothing in your knuckle knows what your finger is, or how to regrow one. All your knuckle “knows” is that it’s bleed and that that bleed needs to stop. Which is why blood vessels clog and scab over, and then the skin slowly grows back over the wound from the outer edges in towards the center. Nothing in that area “knows” that it needs to regenerate bones and ligaments and the other parts of your finger, so it can’t, all that specialized growth is gone.
Fat and muscle store different amounts of water and so the scales send a mild electrical charge through you and measure the impedance, which estimates various facets of your body composition. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis
They don’t. Babies don’t start breathing until after birth. Before that, all the oxygen they need is brought from mom’s lungs, across the placenta, and into baby’s bloodstream via the umbilical cord.
We're not, but compared to every other animal alive and discovered in the fossil record it is. If we ever find a dinosaur that was bigger, then we'll change the text books.
without a constant source of oxygenated blood, the tissues can't survive. they'll be ok for a bit, but yes, the rush is real.
So, a *saturated fat* has all of its carbon-carbon bonds as single bonds. An *unsaturated* fat has one or more carbon-carbon double bond. * A *mono*unsaturated fat has *exactly one* double bond. * A *poly*unsaturated fat has *at least two* double bonds. Remember, "mono" means "one" (monotone, monorail), and "poly" means "many" (polygon).
Likely because if you have chills you may be running a fever and bundling up could make the fever go higher.
"Starvation mode" is partially a myth, just the same as "drink a protein shake within 2 hours of working out or you've missed the anabolic window". Fact is, it's not flipping a switch.  It's not that you're in starvation mode or you're not.  As your calories go lower, your body will expend less energy at idle.  When you reduce calories by a little, your idle calorie expenditure goes down a little.  When you reduce calories a lot, your idle calorie expenditure goes down a lot.  There is no "breakpoint" where you are officially in starvation mode.  I really hate this term because it's not really a "mode", it's just the effects of consuming less calories than you burn and the magnitude scales with how big that difference is.
Dentist here. The short answer: Baby teeth are relatively small and normally only 20 teeth develop. We typically develop 32 much larger permanent teeth. There is much more space available to fit baby teeth even in the tiny bones of an infant compared to the fully grown adult who has all 32 teeth erupted. Adult teeth begin to erupt around age 6 when the jaws are not fully developed, therefore it’s not unusual to find crowding when they first erupt. Teeth usually become less crowded as our jaws grow. Furthermore, permanent teeth aren’t always located in the “right” spot, sometimes causing them to erupt rotated, tipped or tight on top of other teeth. There are other factors at play, which gets a little complicated to explain.
The windpipe and the esophagus (food pipe) are joined together at the back of the mouth. Which makes sense, considering we use the mouth both for eating and drinking as well as breathing. So in order to prevent fluids or solids from entering the lungs, the windpipe closes when swallowing.
The body has too much fluid that it can't manage properly. The kidneys can't expel enough of it, the blood vessels are too damaged/narrow for it to flow, the heart does not pump correctly and some blood and fluid flows back towards the lungs.  Any or all of these problems lead to the same symptom. Extra fluid collects in the lungs where it interferes with gas exchange and directly causes hypoxia the same way drowning does, there's liquid where you lungs need air.
It varies by age and individual. Generally speaking you want to sleep in some number of 1.5 hour cycles. For most adults, 4-5 cycles (about 6-7.5 hours) is a bare minimum recommended.   Note, this is from the time you fall asleep to the time you wake up, it doesn't include the time you lay in bed trying to fall asleep.   [General recommendations based on age can be found in this graphic](https://urdu.nationclip.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleep-recommendations-2.jpg).   For your secondary question, mostly yes. Sleep generally works the same for everyone, but the exact timing of a sleep cycle, and how many before you've had enough rest, is going to differ a bit.
Connective tissues. Think of each organ as also kinda having a net around it. Each organ kinda hangs off of the other in a chain from your skeleton. It would be like taking a bunch of ball nets and tying them together, then hanging them from a rafter or the like.
Your premise is false.  There are over 1,000 different varieties of banana besides your typical Cavendish.  Blue Java is my personal favorite, but there are also Pisang Raja, Lady Finger, Manzano, Burro, etc.
"You" are not the molecules that make you up, but rather the arrangement of those molecules. The same applies to your memories - memories are the pattern of connections between brain cells. If all the cells in a connection are replaced, but the new cells are connected in the same way, then the memory remains the same, because the memory is the pattern of the connection, not the molecules that make it up.  If that's not clear enough, take an analogy. You have a lego set, let's say it's the Batmobile. If you take it apart, you still have all the pieces, but you no longer have the Batmobile. If you buy a copy of every piece separately and swap them into the model one by one, you still have the Batmobile, but none of the pieces are the original pieces. Your memory is the Batmobile, not the pieces.
Imagine you have a *geographical* map of the US. That wouldn't tell you how many states it has. And even if you mapped out the boundaries of a few of the states, you could only estimate how many states there were, based on the sizes of the states discovered. But you wouldn't know the exact number, and wouldn't know their placement, size, or shape. To do that you'd actually have to go, state-by-state, and map out all of the boundaries. But this only gives you physical dimensions of a state. It doesn't tell you, for example, it's politics, culture, what its major imports or exports it has, or how it contributes to the overall whole. And this is basically what we did for DNA. We know how big a strand of DNA was, and knew a few of the genes, but we could only estimate how many total genes there were. So we mapped it. We basically crawled over the entire DNA strand and mapped out what and where everything was. But this didn't necessarily tell us what each individual gene did or how it contributes to making a human.
Your body finds a way to make you stop poisoning yourself for a while so it can recuperate. Also, alcohol messes with your memory, so a blackout is when you don’t remember the night before.  Blacked out once myself, but I was cross faded.  Also forgot to keep up my water intake. The following day sucked.
Color perception is defined by the anatomy of the eye, specifically, photosensitive cells on the retina with specific pigments. If there are more types of these cells and they are sensitive to a wider range of electromagnetic waves, it means the animal can see more colors. If there are less colored cells or none at all, color perception is worse.
Most pregnancy tests use something called a "lateral flow assay." Translating this, it means that fluid moves across a piece of paper (not helped by gravity or other forces) and something is tested. In this case, the test is looking for a specific hormone that is produced after the egg implants into the uterus. If you have this hormone, it means that you are pregnant (or something else is very wrong).  In the test itself, there are antibodies - the same things that help your immune system recognize bacteria and other baddies. Those antibodies are bound to the paper and recognize the hormone, stopping it from flowing across the test with the rest of the urine. All this really does is concentrate it in one line. At this point, you still can't tell if the hormone is there or not because you can't see it, but the next step involves a different set of antibodies. They bind to the concentrated hormone and the binding makes the color appear.  Interestingly, lateral flow assays are one of the most common tests out there. They are really simple ways to look for a specific compound in the body. For instance, if you wanted to look to see if someone had COVID, you could make a lateral flow assay that looks to see if they had viral particles in their nose... which is one way we actually look for it.
Soma is greek for body. Somatic means of the body.  Visceralis is latin for internal. Visceral means relating to internal organs. Nociceptive means physiological activation of pain receptors. So the difference is literally just physical pain of internal organs vs physical pain of the rest of the body. The reason we separate the two is because the nerve response from internal organs is much less 'precise'. This results in a more vague pain, with no distinct location or feeling, unlike the sharp pain you might get from cutting yourself, or hurting a joint.
Parasites generally don't come into your system as full-grown organisms. What happens is that you consume either their eggs or cysticerci (cysticerci are sort of like eggs, but are found in the muscle of pigs or cattle in the form of cysts).  Both of these are resistant to digestion; both acidic and enzymatic. Once the eggs or cysticerci pass through your stomach and end up in a more favorable environment in the small intestine they will hatch and grow into proper parasitic organisms like tapeworms, roundworms, pinworms, etc. I encourage you to google images of human parasite lifecycles to get a nice general idea.
They don’t. They fly all around you looking for good landing spot. You only hear them when they are close to your ears because they are tiny and produce very high pitched sound that quickly dissipates in air across short distances.
Hydrogen peroxide burns you by forcefully oxidizing your organic molecules. That white waxy stuff is what your organic molecules become. The waxy-ness is that clear stuff your skin emits after a normal blister or whatever to help the healing process.
While I don’t think that the actual alcohol has a different effect, many lower quality (and some widely marketed tequilas, looking at you Casamigos and Teremana) have a lot of additives such as flavorings, sweeteners, and coloring that in my opinion, add to the hangover.
When you look at something in a mirror you **are** seeing it at the full distance. You can easily see the difference if you look at a dirty mirror. Focus on the mirror and you see the dirt, focus at the distance of the image and you see that. Screens are different to mirrors in this respect.
You have bacteria living in your mouth. All living things poop. Bacteria poops in your mouth.
We don't know whether something **can** be cured; we only know whether or not we're able to cure it.  Treating symptoms is relatively easier than discovering a cure.
Because your body senses that something needs to come out or is stuck on your throat, therefore it produces more saliva that will aid the object. Either help it go down or go out. The same thing happens when you throw up. The salive acts like a lubricant that will help objects. That's why our body produces more when something is stuck or needs to go down or out.
Biologist here! Not entirely, there's actually a handful of hormones that are used in facial hair growth, and hormones generally don't peak until around the age of 25. Think of puberty as a car. Starting it is just the beginning, to hit top speed, it takes a little while
It was a mistranslation and a misinterpretation of the data. There is some difference in the taste buds across the tongue but it is not significant. However when the scientific papers were translated from German to English to be taught in English universities these differences were taken out of proportion. Further misinterpretation of this paper by textbook writers had them write that the tongue map showed exclusive areas for the taste buds. And because this was considered a fact nobody thought to challenge it. And because it was not a very important area of research nobody got the funding to do further research on this.
Adrenaline and epinephrine are the same thing. Noradrenaline and norepinephrine are the same thing. They're different names, with adrenaline used more in European medicine and epinephrine used more in US medicine. They do pretty similar things. But norepinephrine is more of a constant, while epinephrine comes more in bursts during stress. Norepinephrine constricts blood vessels, keeping your blood pressure up. While epinephrine constricts more, increasing your blood pressure when necessary. Epinephrine is given for allergic reactions because when your body goes into shock (like with anaphylactic shock), your blood pressure drops
At least two effects are occurring here. For one, solids dissolve more into hot water than cold. Think of putting sugar in your hot coffee, it dissolves in a few stirs. But put sugar in your iced coffee and you stir forever and still have undissolved sugar in there. And since you are dissolving soap in water for cleaning, it helps when that soapy water can better dissolve stuff.  Second, while things like oils can’t dissolve in water on its own, hot water does make them less viscous, and the force of the water or scrubbing can more easily remove them. I can get most of the oil off a cast iron pan just with hot water. Cold water actually seems to thicken the oil even more.
Most glues dry by either: 1. Losing part of their liquid content as it evaporates to air 2. Absorbing and reacting with something in the air 3. Reacting with a different component of the glue, which is mixed in as the glue is applied All of these are prevented until the glue leaves the container
Ice doesn't get sticky on its own no matter how long its frozen. What you describe is the same as when a kid licks a frozen metal pole and their tongue sticks to it. The moisture in the surface of their tongue freezes to the frozen surface, making them freeze together. You fingertips also have moisture on them that freezes on contact with an ice cube when it's fresh out of the freezer. As the surface of the icecube warms up then its not cold enough to freeze the moisture on your fingers.
First, methadone is an opiate and completely unlike the other two in every way Second, meth and Ritalin (methylphenidate) are tangently related, but only insomuch as they're both stimulants and could be used for some of the same reasons. Meth is an amphetamine, Ritalin a phenidate. They have different mechanisms of action and are structurally very different. Meth release dopamine, Ritalin is an ndri which allows natural dopamine to build up to higher concentration in your brain essentially Taken medicinally, neither meth nor Ritalin are particularly harmful. Methamphetamine is also a prescription drug under the brand name desoxyn. Very effective and less side effects than most every other ADHD med. The problem with meth is people abusing it often take literally hundreds of times the medicinal dose. As with all things, dose makes the poison   Essentially, don't worry about it. You're fine lol
If contaminants are in your water, like branches or leaves, your chlorine is going to attack them. In the process, your chlorine will get used up. UV rays produced by the sun have a major effect on chlorine. When exposed to UV rays, chlorine ions begin to separate, which eventually destroys them through burning. Additionally, water will evaporate out of your pool. With any pool water loss so does chemical loss.
Fire needs fuel, heat and oxygen. A "small fire" like a lit match out a burning taper, has very little heat, so blowing cools it and stops the flame.  By comparison, the low embers of a fire that's been lit, has lots of heat left, but little oxygen. You add fuel and blow to add oxygen and it'll restart the flame and fire grows
Coming from winery experience (which is a bit different given they do wines by vintage, as in, each years harvest of grapes) they blend. They process each harvest and fill tanks with millions of litres of product, working on each tank till it's at roughly the same composition, then blend every tank with each other. You may start with 1000 tanks that are all slightly different but once you've gone through and blended them all together you have millions of litres of product that's functionally identical.
They're not "different variations of the same", they're "similar names for vastly different things", because humans like confusing names. Look at those structures here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins#Molecular_functions. None of them look even remotely similar, which means they're not anything like each other chemically.
I have never heard this is it true? Water has to get cold before it freezes so how does this work.
Not a researcher in this area, but just read up a lot about ADHD. If it is a reduction in the brain's ability to produce dopamine, medication won't really fix that right. What ADHD medications really do is allow the brain to produce more dopamine which helps control the symptoms of ADHD. I think for a more 'permanent' cure we would have to have a way of fixing the brain's ability to produce dopamine and I don't think we know how to do that.
It's famously challenging, that's a big part of the reason why teflon pans chip so easily and why you need to be so careful with them - the coating really doesn't want to stick to the pan. The go to method is to sandblast the pan so the surface is all roughed up, then spraying on a thin coating of teflon that seeps into that surface. Then you can layer on a bunch more teflon on top of that since teflon sticks to teflon pretty well. tldr it's really hard and we're still not very good at it
Rather simple, really. Some molecules can show "handedness". With, for instance, a carbon atom that has four different types of "attachments" (whatever they may be), there are two ways in which they can be arranged. And those two ways cannot be transformed into each other by rotation: they are enantiomers, just as your left and right hand are. Every such atom is called a stereo center. This has impact on the chemical properties, mainly in the way they rotate polarized light (sugars, as an example), but also physiologically (google "Thalidomide/Contergan").
Liquids are not flammable,  only gasses are.  You have to heat it into a gas.  This is because you need oxygen to burn and oxygen will needs to be excited into its gas form a chemical bond.  Even if you managed to inject a warm bubble of oxygen into the fuel, it would burn itself out of oxygen and smother the flame resulting in no continuous burn. And you're still burning a gas.
No, they don't; oxygen is just incredibly abundant and has a "good" level of reactivity. Fluorine is a far more powerful oxidising agent, but it's so powerful you never see it in its elemental form.
Composting does not create methan the way organic waste in a landfill does.  The difference is air.  Composting allows plenty of oxygen into the process and oxygen loving bacteria can break the waste down without creating methane.  Decomposition works differently in low oxygen environments such as buried deep in a landfill inside a plastic bag. Without oxygen only anarobic bacteria can flourish and release methan as they break down food. Similar to yeast.  In the presence of air, like in bread dough, they are able to flourish without making alcohol.  Take away the oxygen by trapping them in a tank, and they switch to an anaerobic process and create alcohol as a biproduct. There is no methan from composting just like there is no alcohol in your bread.  Because of plenty of air.
It's a mix of urban legend and racism.  MSG is safe. You actually eat it all the time: it's in cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes, etc.
The scale is the way it is because water's freezing and boiling points are easy to measure, and useful reference points in daily life. The distance between those two numbers is decided by what the air pressure happens to be on earth at sea level, and the distance between the freezing point of water and absolute zero is decided by the material properties of water.  273 isn't a value anyone decided on, it's a value that was measured.
The function of a plastic wrap or foil wrap is to exclude oxygen from getting to the product and that slows down the degrading of the product.
Its an acid in the stomach too. Not sure why you think it was a base.      It burns because you've got too much acid that is lining your oesophagus, not your stomach.
Controlled variable is held constant. So it would be the candy, assuming you are using the same candy in the variable kinds of liquid. If you are using multiple kinds of candy and multiple kinds of liquid then you have a multi variant experiment, which is way more complicated statistically.  You have currently: independent variable (type of liquid) Dependent: time for candy to dissolve  Controlled: type of candy (assuming always the same).
A simplified (more likely oversimplified) answer would be that adults have more or less the same amount of blood in their body, even if they're overweight. This results in the same levels of paracetamol in the blood in adults, regardless of their body weight.
Nothing. Caffeine is caffeine, the only difference is dosage. Coffee has more caffeine per unit of volume as compared to tea.
I've never heard this particular myth before.  In general, there are a lot of myths around drinking and it's consequences.  I've heard people say that vodka is 'purer' than Scotch and therefore less likely to cause problems, and I've also heard people claim that vodka causes the worst hangovers.  Everyone has a different body chemistry, and that changes day to day.  What makes you sick after one spree might not affect you the next time.
To answer the question about similar naming, they - along with all those "radi-" words (including "radius," "radiant," and even "ray") come from the same basic Latin root of the words around the idea of a "thing that goes from one thing to another thing", particularly a thing that goes outwards. Radiation as a term has been around for a long time; [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786441908652133) is a random letter from 1819 titled "On Calorific Radiation" (i.e. heat) complaining about how it wasn't understood. So the term "radiation" and similar ones seems to be used as a general term. The term "radioactive" was coined by the Curies in 1898 (in French, originally) to describe stuff that seemed to be giving off these new kinds of radiation. James Clerk Maxwell theorised what we now call "radio waves" in the 1860s, and in the 1880s Heinrich Hertz proved these things to exist and for a while they were known as "Hertz waves", and it wasn't really until 1910 or so when the more generic term "radio wave" had come into use. "Radium" is named after "radioactive" as being an element (the "-ium") that is radioactive. So these terms are related, but not all directly related - some come directly from others, but some just have a similar root.
Most drugs are pretty complex molecules, they're not long-term stable. Between natural breakdown, temperature cycling, oxidation, etc., etc. a lot of them eventually break down and don't work properly or as well.
Because hydrogen doesn't just magically appear out of, if you'll pardon the pun, thin air.  You need to make it in sufficient quantities.  Using current technology, that either means electrolysis of water (which kinda defeats the purpose), or refining a very large quantity of fossil fuels.
We are programmed to enjoy indicators of nutrition, energy, and other necessary things that might be hard to come by.  Things like sugars, fats, salt.  Burnt things dont typically have those values, and so they lack the indicators: being sweet. Rich. Salty. Rotten foods contain dangerous levels of bacteria and other chemicals that can harm us, so we're programmed to avoid and dislike those signifiers (like smell, and when something tastes "off".)
The browning of toast is the result of a process called the "Maillard reaction", which happens because the proteins and sugars in the food get hot enough that they can interact with each other. There is substantial evidence that the Maillard reaction reduces the caloric and nutritional value of food and that the products of the reaction may have some toxic effects [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4745522/)[[2]](https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/31/Supplement_3/37)[[3]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b00882)[[4]](https://ucanr.edu/datastoreFiles/608-648.pdf)[[5]](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/83/5/1082/4649516). A piece of toast will have fewer calories than untoasted bread.
Minerals in the water — ‘hard’ water has more dissolved calcium, typically. Water softeners remove this calcium (often also removing iron and some other minerals) and sometimes replacing some of them with salt. That mineral removal makes the water feel slick.
Nuclear fission bombs produce energy through the fission of atoms - yes, they really split the atom. The basic idea is that you take an atom like Uranium, bombard it with neutrons so that the atoms each absorb an extra neutron, causing them to become an unstable isotope that is prone to undergo nuclear decay. That decay causes them to spit out some neutrons and protons, becoming a new atom, and it also causes them to release energy.
The 3rd shell can always hold 18 electrons, but electrons fill up from the lowest energy states to higher ones. Assuming the 1st and 2nd shells are full, the next 8 electrons you add will go into the 3rd shell, but now there are so many electrons in there that it is actually energetically favorable for the next ones to start filling up the 4th shell. Once two are in the 4th shell then the next 10 will go into the 3rd shell again.
Incorrect to say there is no heat. Your marble counter is at some temperature above absolute zero (0 K)--indeed, above 0 C (273 K), since you are not a polar bear and the water isn't frozen.  Liquid water (and even ice, actually--check out that frost that forms in freezers!) has a non-zero *vapor pressure* directly proportional to the ambient temperature. This means that the water is in *equilibrium* (balance) with a small amount of water vapor.  If you put that water into a sealed bottle in that same room, enough would evaporate to establish the equilibrium vapor pressure at that particular temperature (ie, in the small amount of air inside the bottle) and then no further change would happen. If the bottle is empty when you come back, you know someone drank it or poured it out. Now, your dark bathroom may be "closed" as far as the door is concerned, but it is not a closed *system* in the physical sense, as air still circulates. Over time, these air currents continually carry away the water vapor that is forming at the surface of the water droplets. As this happens, more water evaporates to take its place, until there is no more liquid left.  This is an example of *Le Chatelier's Principle*\--disturb any system that's at equilibrium between A and B (perhaps by adding or removing A or B), and it will shift to oppose the change. Here, the circulating air takes away water vapor, and more is created.
It’s not fire in the ocean. It gas that is escaping from a broken pipe that is igniting when it gets out of the water.
Imagine a hydrogen atom, a proton with a circling electron. It has a net zero charge *over all* but the electron and proton are separate things. Imagine I grabbed the electron and glued it in place to the left of the proton, now you have a (-) side on the left where the electron is and a (+) side on the right where the proton is. This is called "polarity" and it's kind of similar to the north/south poles on a magnet, only using electric charge in lieu of magnetism.  Now imagine a water molecule, the oxygen atom pulls on the hydrogen's electrons and holds them close, just like the example above. So now the side of the hydrogen atom that's closest to the oxygen atom is the (-) charge and the side that's opposite the oxygen has the (+) charge. Similarly, presence of the hydrogen's electrons repels the oxygen's existing electrons away to the opposite side. So a water molecule is polar, meaning the hydrogen side is slightly positive and the oxygen side is slightly negative. This polarity is pretty powerful and part of the reason why water things like salt love dissolving in water, the water's polarity is powerful enough to tear the salt molecule apart.  Bond angles are related to polarity. The various (-) and (+) parts of a molecule all push and pull on each other and eventually establish a balance.
Engineer that works in a hospital: So a few things, while yes, there is oxygen all around us, but it's actually a mixture of oxygen, carbon dioxide and  Nitrogen  and of those 3, only 21% is made of oxygen. The reason hospitals are running out of oxygen is because we have a supply tank that is filled with liquid oxygen connected to a vaporizer system to turn the liquid into gas to be administered into the piping system to be delivered to the patient. Because this tank has a limited amount, the companies that refill these tanks are put under massive strain to not only attend the increase demand, but also to re supply their own stock to have the tanks re filled  As for generating the oxygen from the air, yes it is possible through a machine called an oxygen concentrator, problem is that these can usually only create 95% oxygen where as some of the sever cases need 100%, so while it is a good substitute, it's not a replacement. Also I've never directly worked with the concentrators as luckily my hospital hasn't had a major need for them, I would imagine it takes a while to create a usable supply of pure oxygen Edit: made a correction on type of gas
Those reactions are, more or less, "eating" heat energy and turning it into mass in the form of bond energy. So the surrounding area gets colder because the  energy to create those bonds has been transformed into something other than heat.
>What prevents this strategy ? You answered that question yourself, they rely on >photosynthesis Which relies on sunlight (or other sources of light, but those all create more CO2 than they can help capture), which means we'd need to dedicate large portions of the planet's surface to shallow(ish) open topped water tanks with just the right mix of nutrients to promote algae growth.  Ideally we'd want to put in airpumps as well, which use energy and therefore release CO2, to aerate the water and speed up growth, and as a bare minimum we'd need water pumps constantly adding water to offset evaporation. Which requires more energy, and more CO2.  At some point, just using that surface area for solar panels and not producing as much CO2 in the first place is simply more efficient.
Refrigeration works because it slows the progression of bacterial growth. Once you open the container, you’re exposing the product to bacteria, so to keep it fresh longer, you refrigerate.
Biological matter contains a lot of carbon (it’s the backbone for most organic molecules) and hydrogen (stuck to most of the free sites on the carbons), plus a bunch of other trace stuff.  Most biological molecules are fairly large and not all that long-term stable so they tend to break down under heat and pressure. If oxygen is around, or anaerobic bacteria (bacteria who can function without oxygen), they’ll eat/react the organic molecules and break them down to simple molecules to extract the bond energy.  But if there’s no oxygen around, and no bacteria, like when oil source rock gets formed, there’s only so far the organic molecules can break down before they’re stuck…there’s nothing around to react with or break them down further. They get as simple as they can with the energy available until they hit something long-term stable. That point is oil.  We dig it up and provide oxygen and break it the rest of the way down.
If there is no salt in the water, you won't like the taste.  You can buy this at the grocery store, it's called triple distilled water. If there is a little salt and minerals, the water tastes good. If there is a ton of salt or minerals, the water tastes salty or "hard".
Detergents use physical means to remove dirt and such. The detergent molecules are long and skinny; one end of the molecule dissolves in water, and the other end doesn’t. The ends that don’t stick to dirt particles and form a sort of shell around them, meaning the sides of the molecules that dissolve in water are all facing “out”, so the dirt particle essentially dissolves in the water by proxy and is carried away in the rinse. Stain removers work by chemical means. They cause a chemical reaction with the stain molecules that either breaks them apart, or changes their colour.
There are two things in an aerosol can. There's the product, and then there's also the propellant. The propellant is a special chemical that is liquid at the temperature/pressure the inside of the can, but is a gas at the pressure outside the can.  By mixing the two up, when the valve is opened, the propellant that is able to escape turns into a gas, but it takes some of the product with it. If you didn't mix it, you could get a lot of propellant without any product coming out.
So you are cooling your coffee down rapidly “freezing” the compounds to prevent them from changing but the bigger part is they also get diluted when you add ice. It stays the same strength and has more energy to react if you just put it in the fridge. If you want to see the same thing in a more noticeable way take a (good) scotch put a shot in the freezer/fridge, a shot at room temperature (neat), a neat shot with a splash of water, a neat shot poured over ice (rocks), and a neat shot over rocks with water. They will all taste wildly different and different notes will stand out please sip these and don’t just down them in one go for the full effect. If you want to get super fancy compare the same bottle split between a decanters and as it is in the bottle prepared the same ways. You can also do this with coffee but the changes are in general less drastic.
Water vapor can still do some serious damage, but the contact area is more sparse and unless it condenses on your skin it’s difficult to feel.  If you place your hand above a pot of boiling water, you will get burned if you keep it there long enough for water to condense.
CO2 is widely produced industrially by burning a fossil fuel like coal or natural gas. The problem with doing this, however, is that fossil fuels are often not pure enough to produce food-grade CO2, unless they are extensively purified first, and even then, the CO2 has to be extremely carefully refined for purity. For example, burning coal contaminates the CO2 with toxins like mercury, benzene, and other chemicals which are difficult to refine out and are absolutely unacceptable for food use - but would be OK for something like a fire-extinguisher or some other industrial use. Instead, food-grade CO2 is often produced by capturing and refining waste CO2 from specific chemical processes where the chemicals are already very pure, and the waste CO2 is also pure. Typically, this is ammonia production (for fertilizer). The ammonia production reaction requires pure hydrogen (which is produced by refining and chemically reacting natural gas). As a waste product of the hydrogen production, extremely pure CO2 is produced, and this can be captured as food-grade CO2. Alcohol and fuel-ethanol production also produces extremely high purity CO2 from the yeast fermentation, so this is also a source of food-grade CO2.
You totally can dye air. The catch is: the dye must also be a gas of similar density. Otherwise, denser dye (which at Earth atmospheric conditions includes all liquids and solids) will fall, settle at the bottom while lighter dye will rise higher. Chlorine gas is nice and yellow and will take some time settling. This means that you will be able to see the burn-your-lungs goodness approaching your trench just fine.
Basically there's a small bit of slightly radioactive material in a box. This box is shielded, and has one side open. There is an air gap, and then a simple Geiger counter. When the Geiger counter starts counting below a certain number of counts/minute, something in the air gap is blocking the radiation, and the alarm goes off. As for determining smoke from steam, it can't. Given heavy enough steam, it'll go off.
There is. Alcohol free wine is just a juice. The alcohol comes from the sugar fermenting. So if you don’t ferment it it is just juice. Alcohol free wine is grape juice.
Tablets contain the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and excipients – inert compounds that can also serve as drug delivery systems. Some individuals, especially children, have difficulty swallowing larger pills, which might deter them from taking the medication altogether. However, tiny pills are harder to handle, especially in the older population who might have poorer dexterity and eyesight. In addition, how small a pill can get is dependent on the dosage. If a single dose of a drug requires a large amount of API or excipients, they are sometimes split into two smaller pills. In most cases, patients prefer a single tablet per dose, as they might forget (in the case of older patients) or refuse to take multiple tablets (in the pediatric population).
Liquid - a state of matter with a definite volume but no definite shape.  Solid - a state of matter with a definite volume and a definite shape.
Hay is made from freshly-cut plant matter. When plant matter decays in a moist environment, bacteria and other microbial life thrive. Organisms generate heat as a natural byproduct of just being alive. The hay insulates the heat, so the hay cannot cool quickly enough. When the temperature reaches about 130ºF, the moisture and the microbial life undergo chemical reactions that release even more heat. Hay has a remarkably low ignition point of a little over 200ºF. For comparison, paper ignites at about 450ºF.
When you dump water into a grease fire, it splashes underneath the grease, flashes to steam because the oil is much hotter than the boiling point of water, and throws tiny droplets of oil into the air, where there's much more surface area available for combustion.
A "**solve**nt" is a material which can dis**solve** another substance.  When chemical A dissolves into chemical B, A's molecules become scattered through B and fully contained by it. You can clean up salt stains or sugar smears simply by wiping it down with water.  The water is a solvent, and after cleaning, you no longer have clean water, you have salt water or sugar water. Similarly, when you use a cleaning solvent, the substance you are cleaning is dissolved into your solvent.  You no longer have pure clean solvent, you have a dirty mixture (which you then usually throw away).
What we perceive as Color is the different wavelengths of light reflecting off an object. What gives an object color is its atoms absorbing certain wavelengths of light (photons interact with the electrons in an atom and change their energy state), we then see the light that's reflected off. The technical term for the study of this is spectroscopy. Astronomers use this fact to study the light of objects like stars to determine which wavelengths they absorb, and therefore what they are made of.
It depends on the acid and the substance being dissolved. The rest that’s not oxygen doesn’t just disappear. Some plastics and rubber materials can’t be dissolved in most acids. So you’re either separate all these materials and dissolving them or just adding a bunch of different acids and hope it dissolved everything. But then you have a pool of dangerous acid and hope nobody falls in or it seeps elsewhere like rivers or the local daycare.
The wax is the fuel. Just like with gasoline, it burns. In this case, paraffin plus oxygen becomes CO2 and smoke.
Some medicines require that you take medicine after a meal as the medicine may cause nausea or stomach irratation when taken on an empty stomach. Some medicines require the opposite, that they be taken on an empty stomach and this may be due to precise dosage affected by food or vitamins/chemicals in the food reacting with the medicine.
Iron’s magnetism isn’t a property of individual iron atoms. Iron is only magnetic when many iron atoms are bound together in a specific crystal structure. Since hemoglobin (the iron-containing compound in blood which transports oxygen) contains only a single iron atom, it is not ferromagnetic.
They leech chemicals that give scent and flavor from the wooden barrels (casks) that they are aged in. Cheep liquor is usually water down ethanol with flavor additives and possibly food coloring. Source: used to make distilled liquor at home and read a bunch of books on it.
Na wants to be in relationship with Cl. Very badly. “Burning” is the process of union. And they live happily ever after. Once coitus has been achieved there’s no motive for Na to look any further and it becomes fat and lazy.  Through great effort they can be separated. But then Na will quickly hop in bed with the first sleazy anion it can find. Na is desperately thirsty, but loyal.
Hi from /r/flashlight.  They don't really exist.  Yellow just happens to be a difficult color to produce directly at high powers.  There are some options for indicator LEDs but that doesn't seem to be what you are looking for. You can see on [page 15 of this datasheet](https://cree-led.com/media/documents/XLampXPE2.pdf) the spectrums for commonly available LEDs.  The "PC Amber" has a lot of 580nm in it but the peak is still 590nm.  These are very similar to the LEDs that I had recommended to you last time you asked.
It contains two chemicals, usually baking soda and an acid, like citric acid, that when dropped into and dissolved in water, react with each other releasing CO2 gas, which is the fizzy stuff.  This is the same reaction used to make model baking soda volcanos in school.  The ingredients are just packed together in a dry form and only react when they start dissolving in water. I don't think it would be considered carbonated, because the fizz itself is not actually entering or dissolving in the water like with a carbonated drink, instead it is just bubbling up through the water after being released by the baking soda-acid reaction.
You put the mold (penicillium) in a vat with water and all of the food and chemicals it needs to grow. The mold grows and produces the desired chemical (penicillin). When it has produced all of the penicillin it can, we begin extraction. Basically we filter out all of the other waste products and then use a process called ion extraction which separates the water from all of the other things that are dissolved in it. This leaves you with crystalized/powdered penicillin.
Firstly molten aluminium can be any temperature above its melting point. So if you heat up aluminium to over the melting point of iron it is still going to be molten. But you do not even have to heat it that much. When you put the iron into the molten aluminium the surface of the iron will react with the aluminium and form an aluminium-iron alloy. And this alloy might have a melting point bellow the temperature in the crucible and will therefore melt. This will then expose more iron to the molten aluminium and the process continues.
It depends. Some sunblock reflects uv back away from the skin. In this case none of that energy is absorbed by the body. Others absorb it and turn it into heat energy. The heat energy might cause some discomfort when transferred into the skin but won’t cause ionization of organic molecules which is what causes sun burn. Understand sun burn isn’t the same as a normal burn like you might get from a stove top.
1) the atoms that make them up are different 2) the way the atoms are bonded is different (I think one is left handed and the other right handed, and I know you can’t turn a left-handed molecule into a right handed one without physically changing it) 3) as a result, though they bond to a similar set of brian parts, they don’t bond the same way. Address helps stimulate the “focus” part of the frontal lobe in the ADHD brain. Meth stimulates everything all at once
Bacteria breed in food, but it requires a couple of conditions. They need both oxygen and warmth to reproduce. If you vacuum seal a product, you limit the amount of oxygen the bacteria will get. However, any imperfections in the vacuum seal (like a big pocket of air in a cavity of the meat) will significantly reduce this effect. Any supermarket that cuts their own meat on-site will not open a primal or subprimal until they are ready to butcher the whole thing. In the event that they don't, they have access to much higher grade vacuum sealers than most people do at home. The second factor is temperature. Essentially, once you get below a certain temperature, the reproductive rate slows down a lot. However, it doesn't completely stop. If you bring the meat up to a higher temperature for a while (like, for instance, between picking it off the counter and putting it in your fridge), then the bacteria have had a chance to reproduce during that time. Even though you put it back in the cold, you're starting with a higher bacteria load than if it had just remained in the cold that whole time.
Stables isotopes like O18, C13 H2 accumulate in keratin cells (hair, nails). Since the isotopes are stable and keratin is also inert after they form you can analyze the ratio of these isotopes and determine where someone is from because the distribution of these isotopes vary geographically. Yes you have to live for sometime in the area for the isotope to accumulate. I don't know if there are overlaps in data but it's not impossible.  but I've heard that it's used in analysis of migration of animals. I didn't know it was also used in forensics because humans don't consume the food that only comes from the region they live in which would make isotope analysis a lot harder.
Short answer: eggs are not pasta. Long answer: when eggs boil, their proteins denaturate and change from a liquid into a solid form. Thus it gets hard When pasta boils, it soaks in water and thus becomes a little bit more liquid than before (when it was bone dry). Water seeps into the gaps of the starch chains and seperates those chains making the pasta soft.
When you burn a piece of food, you're allowing the proteins and sugars within it to go past the point of caramelization to a fully-blackened, carbonized state. Burned food is, by definition, overwhelmingly bitter—the other flavours present will be unpleasantly overshadowed by acridness.
The sudden change in temperature causes thermal shock which translates to stress on an object. In this case - the ice cube.  Every object has what's causes a tensile strength - which is the maximum stress a material can hold up before it cracks.  When you pour hot water onto an ice cube, it causes a thermal shock (stress) and when that stress exceeds the ice cubes tensile strength - it cracks.
Not all drinks made from the coffee plant are the same. High pressure water is espresso, and that’s finicky to make. A good machine can help extract fully and evenly. A bad machine just makes drip coffee. I don’t think there are big differences between variations on drip coffee machines, because that’s where you’re right: hot water is dropped on ground coffee and comes out the bottom. A really fancy machine might emulate pour-over or other techniques behind dumping water, but most just drop water at some rate. Higher-tech machines can have settings like making coffee automatically in the morning so you can wake up to fresh-brewed coffee with no wait, but that’s not better coffee. That’s all about electric coffee makers, though. I started with espresso, which is a different extraction. There are other ways to make drip-like coffee: French press, Aeropress, Mika pot, and more. They make slightly different coffees, and it’s a matter of preference which one is best.
So you always want to start with the 2.3 as a basis. In order to get to your desired 0.00023, you need to divide 2.3 by 10000. 2.3 divided by 10,000 is the same as saying 2.3 times 1/10,000. 10,000 = 10^4, and 1/10,000 = 1/10^4. From there we can convert 1/10^4 to 10^-4. Hope this helps!
If you have really clean glassware and really pure water and freeze it. It doesn't freeze it becomes super cooled, as it's so pure. As soon as you add a contaminate to it it insta freezes. Same as flash boiling.
Adding lead did a lot of good things. It made it dry quicker, it made it last longer, it made it more moisture resistant. Lead is really really helpful except when it comes to human health
The main difference is that your insurance will pay for it if it’s been prescribed.  Otherwise the only difference is the recommended dosage.
There are two main points, one is volume, the other is the type of combustion.  When a candle burns, the smoke is burnt and very little escapes as anything but water and CO2. Cigarette smoking isn't really combustion at all, it's a very dirty pyrolisis where heat from the ember causes the tobacco to decompose and make a lot of smoke, none of which is burnt. The smoke generated by this process has a high percentage of aromatic hydrocarbons, which are known for being heavy, sticky, carcinogenic, and aromatic.  You get the same process from smoking anything, such as marijuana, but where a group of people may share a joint, a tobacco smoker will convert 20 or so cigarettes into carcinogenic tar every day.
You thought about it a little bit didn't you?
It is tangible, quantifiable rather. Some reactions to break bonds require energy some do not. Exthermic reaction vs endothermic.  Vibration and heat are functionally the same too.
Because the time it would take to fully decay is theoretically infinite. If 1kg takes 10 years to decay into 0.5kg, then it would take an additional 10 years to decay into 0.25kg, and another 10 years to decay into 0.125kg. In theory, it would never reach 0. Also, the time it takes to fully decay depends on how much you started out with. Half-life, on the other hand, is a fixed measurement. The half-life of 1kg of Uranium is the same as the half-life of 100kg of Uranium.
It's better to say fire requires an oxidizer Oxygen is the only common oxidizer hanging around but there are other options made in labs and some fires get creative Chlorine trifluorine is a great oxidizer and will make damn near anything burn quite well - sand, asbestos, test engineers Other fires get crafty. A titanium fire burns hot enough that it can split the diatomic nitrogen gas in the air and burn using just nitrogen once it's up and running. While normally paired up and inert, single nitrogen atoms oxidize pretty well So yeah, if your fire isn't running on oxygen your best equipment for dealing with it is a good pair of running shoes
Best guess, what you're seeing is oils from handling the coin that have been broken down in the flame, in a similar manner to how seasoning a carbon steel pan produces a shiny yellow-brown coating during the early stages of seasoning before it produces the usual thick black coating. It's not a copper-nickel alloy, at least not a pure one - despite the copper, [cupronickel is silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupronickel). My second best guess is [nickel(II) oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel(II\)_oxide) - blowtorch flames are well-oxygenated and hot nickel reacts readily with oxygen. But nickel(II) oxide is more of a greenish yellow than it is gold. But these are just guesses, and it's not likely anyone's going to be able to say without more information.
It protonates and dehydrates the nitric acid to form the [nitronium ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitronium_ion) NO2^(+) which actually does the nitration reaction.
Crack, to simplify is essentially coke cut with a lot of baking soda in a very low tech process. The marketing scheme is not that it is better than coke, but ready to smoke. Smoking coke hits you much harder than snorting it.  The reality is that a lot of coke probably is indeed synthetic because other chemical drugs are far cheaper. Crack is very likely to be made with this non-coke quite often. Stay away from all street drugs! Yah never know what it really is, and fentanyl is killing people at a stunning rate.
A mole is 6.0221x10^23 of something. Usually in chemistry it's referring to ions, molecules, electrons, or similar.  To see why it's important, let's say you're combining chloride and sodium to make salt. NaCl is one part sodium, and one part chlorine, but one gram of sodium plus one gram of chloride doesn't get you two grams of NaCl.  However, if you use moles, it works. One mole of sodium and one mole of chloride would react to give one mole of sodium chloride. One mole of sodium weighs about 23 grams, and one mole of chloride weighs about 35.5 grams.
That's crazy, they do taste plain as hell! Life pro tip: Fry the Mac & Cheese in a frying pan with butter in medium heat for 3 minutes, add some extra cheese if you have it, thank me later......
You Think chicken ans pork retain their texture?
Question: I don't know what you mean. The atmosphere is 78% nitrogen and that's all "room temperature", relative to where its at. No molecule has an inherit temperature. EDIT: Radioactive molecules may increase the temperature of things around them, but any stable molecule doesn't hold onto any certain temperature.
Imagine a room full of people blindfolded with arms extended trying to grab each other's hands. When they're moving quickly they struggle to grab hands and are generally within the reach of each other's arms running into each other. As they slow down, it gets easier to grab hands with each other instead of smashing face first into a fist. When they slow down enough, everyone is able to grab hands. Now everyone is two full arm lengths away from everyone else rather than crammed in closer. Water works the same way. The hydrogen bonds want to form but above 4c they're not strong enough to generally hold. Once water hits 4c, as it gets colder more of those bonds are able to form and they spread out. When it freezes, they form into bigger lattices of a crystaline structure. I don't have an example for another material at this moment. Sorry.
Helium, on an atomic scale, is a very small molecule. An oxygen or nitrogen molecule you'd find in the atmosphere is massive by comparison. So a traditional airtight seal, may not be helium tight and the molecules will slowly find their way through the atomic scale pores in almost any seal we can make. The rate of loss will be slow, but there will still be loss. That rate will increase the more seals the helium comes in contact with, like when it is moved through pipes.
Evaporation is when molecules of water "peel off" from the surface.  Can happen at lower than 100 C, depending on wind or temperature differences between the air and the water.  The wind, basically, or dry air can "pick up" water molecules from the surface of the liquid. Boiling is throughout the volume of the liquid, even down at the bottom.  100 C is what's required to "force" that transition from liquid to gas in the entire volume of the liquid.
>Eli5 How the sun burns without oxygen      1. The sun does not burn, it conducts nuclear fusion of Hydrogen into heavier elements.      2. A fire does not require oxygen, it only requires an oxidizer (a substance that gets chemically reduced during the reaction).
Yes!  Ignore what others have said, a proton can be considered an atom.  Specifically, it is a hydrogen ion.  A neutral hydrogen atom would normally have a proton with an electron floating around.  If we strip away the electron, we're left with an H+ ion, which is still an atom.  But all that there is is a proton. As an aside, this is what tastes acidic.  We have ion channels in our tongues that let us taste stuff.  When a particular ion goes through the right channel, a signal goes to our brain and that's taste.  Acids have a lot of H+ ions, and this is what gives stuff a sour taste.  So when something tastes sour, you're literally tasting protons.
First, the probiotic prescription is also "take at regular intervals", so the probiotic bacteria are replenished by you taking another pill when the previous ones have died. And then, antibiotics do kill bacteria, including the probiotic ones, but the antibiotic is not like lysol, instant death.  It's more like a toxin for bacteria, it does take a few hours, during which the probiotic bacteria CAN multiply in your intestines and do some of the digestion for you. It's actually a matter of doses; you get enough antibiotic "strength" to kill whatever infection you have, and you get enough probiotic bacteria so that they can multiply enough even WITH the effects of the antibiotic killing some of them in the few hours that it takes to do so.
Because the "mass of a proton" is not as easy to define as you think. It turns out that if you take apart a carbon atom or really any atom into a bunch of protons and neutrons, the protons and neutrons will have more mass than the carbon atom itself. This is because free protons/neutrons have more energy than a carbon atom, and by Einstein's E=mc^2 they thus have more mass. In fact there used to be an older definition of the AMU that used oxygen instead. But oxygen has slightly different binding energy to carbon and as such a slightly different amu, the scientific community came to a consensus that both definitions could not be used.  Regardless though we could have defined the AMU to be the mass of a free proton/neutron. The reason seems to be because carbon is a convenient element. Its solid at room temperature and pressure, pretty chemically stable, and as such experiments could be conducted on things made from carbon pretty easily to determine the count of the carbon atoms in it.
A few things at issue here: - Tastes are felt on the tongue, as is umami. Flavours are smelled. People with anosmia (inability to smell) may still be able to detect salt, sweet, sour, etc even if they can't smell, but wouldn't be able to detect aromas or other flavours.  - Umami is not specifically from one ingredient. MSG is one particular glutamate (**M**ono**S**odium **G**lutamate), but far from the only one, and there are non-glutamate compounds which also trigger umami sensations.  - Something coming from just one ingredient *doesn't* mean it can't be a taste. In fact, sourness is just your tongue detecting Hydrogen ions. Nothing else creates sourness.
Probably the lower dissolved oxygen. This is the same reason boiled water tastes weird. You can fix it by pouring it back and forth between two cups to reoxygenate the water.
It’s basically filtering with an extremely small filter that doesn’t even let any ions or substances dissolved through This requires very large pressures to overcome the osmotic pressure, which is the tendency of water to pass through a membrane like that from the side of pure water, to the side where there are dissolved solids, this is why it’s called reverse osmosis  And yes that’s basically how we make pure water
The property that you are discussing (expanding to fill a container) is a property of a “fluid” which both liquids and gasses are.
Ice needs to be 0° before it can melt. Water needs to be 0° before it can freeze. But the process of ice melting takes energy, and that energy has to come from somewhere. If you take a large block of ice and leave it out at room temperature, the ice will melt, because the ice is getting energy from the air. If you have a cup of ice cubes and water in it, the water gives up its heat to the ice cubes. The water cools down and the ice warms up. If there isn't enough energy in the water to melt all of the ice, you'll get a mixture of ice and water at 0° - at least, until the water/ice mixture melts by getting heat from the air around it.
A mole is just a number. It's a specific number, 6.02x10^23, which happens to be a very large number. Sort of like how "A dozen" is a number that means 12. If I ask you to get me a dozen bagels, you know I want 12 bagels. If I ask you to get me a mole of hydrogen atoms, you know I want 6.02x10^23 hydrogen atoms. What the 1.008 grams means is that 1 mole of hydrogen weighs 1.008 grams. You can have a .0005 g sample because that's less than 1 mole...
Most of the complex stuff started as simple stuff. Think about being an ancient human. You’re just trying to find stuff that you can eat. You chew on the tops of these stalky things, and find that they taste ok, not great… except sometimes, they’re really sweet and delicious. You’re a human, you’re curious and smart, and so it doesn’t take long to figure out the secret - water and heat. When seeds get hot and wet, they become tasty tasty malt. So, you’ve got fire, you’ve got water, you can make this happen. What you end up with is… not what you were going for, but it is still pretty good. And it really, really fills you up, for a long time. Congratulations: you have invented porridge. Over time, you find that different grains behave differently when mixed with hot water. Someone wonders what would happen if you crushed the seeds before mixing it, and you get something like polenta. Someone else tries the crushing thing, but they crush it down way too much, and end up with this weird blob. Annoyed, they throw their ruined dinner on the smouldering fire… but later, they’re hungry, and they go through the ashes to see if there’s anything left of it that might be edible. Surprise! It’s (unleavened) bread, and it’s just about the best thing they’ve ever eaten. The recipe for bread spreads quickly among the humans, thanks to this convenient language thing they’ve come up with. One day, someone is making some bread, but then something happens to distract them and they leave the dough out for a day or so. When they come back, it’s miraculously doubled in size. They won’t know why for thousands of years, but we do - wild yeast got into it. They’ll probably figure that it was the stick they used to stir it (which has a live yeast culture on it), or something like that. But more bread is more better, and it’s now deliciously light and fluffy and easy to swallow. Rinse and repeat for the other stuff. Yoghurt is milk gone off with style. Etc.
the VAST majority of wine is meant to be consumed within the first few years of release.  many fine red wines have tannins and phenolic compounds that can be intense and forward in a young wine, and will change chemically over time as they bind with each other, soften and become more integrated. kind of like a food dish that requires some length simmering to really develop deep and complex flavors.  as many have already stated, there is a point where a wine can age too long and lose much of what made it enjoyable.  my biggest advice is to try wines of young, mid and older ages to find what you like best. although im somewhat of a wine geek, i don’t enjoy substantially aged wines. i prefer my wines on the mid-young range, generally in years 6-12 after vintage date. i find there’s still plenty of forward fruit flavors, with some added secondary flavors and a softer structure. if i’m presented with a very young wine and a very old wine, i’m always choosing the young wine.
Air moves moisture around, be it bringing moisture into and/or out of a container/bag, thus making the food go stale.
This is subjective. Perhaps it deals with how one is consuming each beverage, and the relative alcohol content per drink, but… subjective. I mean, the majority of wine drinkers aren’t drinking that beverage in the same way that, say, tequila shots are consumed.  Also, there are differences in _high-end_ versions of each beverage and low-end versions. Processing and bottling may add complexity to this whole equation.  There’s some vodka that is super expensive, and some that is super cheap, and about 99% of the constituents of the actual drink are very similar — water and ethanol.  Might be that there’s a lot of mental attitude that goes into these differences.
Anaerobic respiration (respiration without oxygen) happens which produces products such as CO2 and Lactic Acid. Lactic acid lowers the pH of the solution turning it acidic. The acidic environment is unfavorable to many pathogens hence increasing the preservability of a food.
Cold air tends to be more dense, so just sits there, trapping pollutants close to the ground. This, plus the increase in emissions due to increases in heating, people using cars more and decreases in rain 'washing' out pollutants leads to higher concentrations in winter.
A ) incredibly dangerous B ) Produces byproducts that can be toxic or dangerous  C ) Acid isn't magic. Eventually the thing that actually is eating your garbage will run out leaving you with a vat of chemicals you'd have to get removed anyway. All you've really done is turned your garbage in to a vat of polluting chemicals you'd likely need to get picked up the same as your garbage.
Are you mildly allergic to chocolate?  I've never felt a burning sensation.
The bacteria that process the cheese emit gas which collects in these pockets in the cheese.  It's the same process used to put holes in bread.
It releases at the CO2 that was infused into the liquid. So instead of releasing the gas into your mouth as you drink, creating that wonderful fizzy effect, the gas is released into the can leaving flavored water behind.
The purpose of kneading dough is to encourage consistency and even distribution.  Dough rises due to the formation of pockets of CO2, and as it rises other processes are also happening, like the formation of gluten, which helps trap CO2 and also gives bread its texture. Kneading it again after it rises helps spread around that CO2 and also results in a finer, more distributed gluten structure, which lends itself to better flavour and a better crumb (the pattern of holes in the bread).  If you didn't do this step, you might end up with a denser loaf whose air pockets are more inconsistently spaced out. TL;DR, it gives the yeast more time to do its thing, improving the texture and taste.
\> Whenever I look into some toxic chemical, it inevitably seems to have nitrogen in there somewhere Counterexample: Pure Chlorine gas. \> any nitrogen compound seems to be toxic, or at least have some intoxicating/sedative effect Counterexample: Pure Nitrogen gas. It's confirmation bias, once you've come up with a theory like that it's really easy to believe whatever you see backs it up. Most organic chemistry involves Carbon, Hydrogen and Nitrogen.  So those atoms show up regularly in all sorts of interesting molecules.
You put less heat in than you get out. Fire is therefore exothermic. It is, however, composed of smaller subreactions, some of which are endothermic while others are exothermic, the latter of which are 'stronger'. This is why fire can sustain itself but requires a kick to start.
Sea salt isn't just sodium chloride. Sodium chloride is a major constituent, but there are other salts present such as Potassium Chloride that gives it a different appearance.
Hot water has more space and activity between molecules meaning it has more space and energy to dissolve dirt and grime.
Sodium fluoride (NaF) actually doesn’t turn into hydroflouric acid when places in water, at least not in any appreciable amount) it just dissolves like table salt (NaCl) does. If it actually did this then dissolving table salt in water would turn into hydrochloric acid and burn you. The fact that saltwater (or toothpaste which contains NaF) doesn’t burn you is pretty solid evidence this doesn’t occur.  As for why this doesn’t occur, it has to do with energy states, entropy ensures compounds will always move toward the most stable/lowest energy state they can be in, and lower energy states usually correspond with lower reactivity, the fact that NaF is much less reactive than HF means that the “reaction” (technically dissolving in this case) would STRONGLY favor the more stable (and more inert/harmless) compound which is NaF. Additionally it is well known that mixing HF and NaOH will yield NaF and H2O, in general if 2 things react “perfectly” (i.e. 100% product) to form a product, they will not reach the other way as the reaction is MUCH more favorable in the other direction and reversing the reaction would take quite a bit of energy.  Hope that clears things up, lmk if you have any additional questions!
Water is a polar molecule - one end of it has a slight positive charge, and the other end has a slight negative charge.  This makes it _exceptionally_ good at pulling things into solution - it will start pulling atoms or molecules out of existing structures and hold on to them.  It is so good that water is often called the 'universal solvent' Salt is NaCl, which is held together by a weak(er) ionic bond - which means water is really good at putting salt into solution. So good that getting all the salt out of water is a very labor insensible task.  Most sand is silicon dioxide, which is not polar at all and very stable.  It doesn't pull at the salt molecules, so they stay together.
From my understanding they quite often have a coating that slowly breaks down over time. If you crush or dissolve them they cease to become modified-release. I wouldn’t have thought that people making illegal drugs would be interested in investing in this and quite often people appear to want it to work as fast as possible anyway, hence cocaine often being snorted.
In most cases, it increases the level of the medicine in your blood. This can increase the risk of side effects or alter the effect the medicine has. Many drugs are broken down (metabolized) with the help of a vital enzyme called CYP3A4 in the small intestine. Grapefruit juice can block the action of intestinal CYP3A4, so instead of being metabolized, more of the drug enters the blood and stays in the body longer. The result: too much drug in your body.
From Wikipedia entry for “blood red”: “dried blood often has a darker, rust-colored quality: all dried blood has been oxygenated and then desiccated, causing the cells within it to die.” (As soon as blood leaves the body, it is oxygenated, which is why it is bright red.  Oxygenation of blood does not explain it turning brown, but the break down of the cells in blood does make sense as for why it turns brown.) An excerpt from livescience.com: “Over time, spilled blood that starts out red turns darker and darker as it dries, and its hemoglobin breaks down into a compound called methemoglobin. As time passes, dried blood continues to change, growing even darker thanks to another compound called hemichrome.” I don’t know if Castile soap does this on its own, but it is possible that peppermint oil speeds up the desiccation of cells or speeds up the break down of these proteins. Oh!  I found this: "Peppermint, parsley and their mixture oils have strong radical scavenging activity and antioxidant activity" (from this scientific research paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0570178315000469). So- red blood has been oxygenated.  Heme (the iron part of red blood cells) basically acts like a free radical, which is how it can attach to oxygen & carry it around and release it - it can do oxidative damage.  I’m not great at explaining this, and please, anyone who knows better, add and adjust & correct me!  ‘ But it seems like the strong antioxidant effects of peppermint oil may immediately alter the hemoglobin in your blood, turning it brown.
It's vanilla, not raspberry you're thinking of. Flavorists make artificial flavors by combining chemicals made from inedible ingredients, such as paper pulp or petroleum. Artificial flavors are made to smell and taste exactly like natural flavorings. They must pass stricter safety testing, too.
It doesn't absorb it, it adsorbs it. Basically the outside of silica gel is really sticky for water. So when water in the air gets near it, it gets stuck. Overtime, in an enclosed space, enough water gets stuck to it that it reduces the humidity and prevents the growth of things that require humidity (mold, bacteria)
It takes time and exposure to air to dry out, and for certain things like paint, it will form a film at the surface that will slow the drying process of the liquid underneath. If you leave a paint can open for long enough, it will eventually dry out completely.  But things like paint are also formulated very carefully so that they stay liquid for as long as the user would need it. On a wall, it’s also got much more surface area so the drying out process happens much more quickly. Oh, and sometimes it’s not “drying” in the sense of water is leaving the liquid and leaving behind a solid.  Sometimes there’s a chemical reaction with the air (specifically with the water vapor in the air) that makes it turn from liquid to solid.  Lots of glues use this sort of reaction, superglue being a good example.  This means that as long as you keep it stopped up in the container, it will stay liquid.
I think you're misunderstanding what an acid is. An acid is not just some caustic chemical that burns things. DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic **acid** and DNA is obviously not a caustic chemical that burns things. An acid is something that donates hydrogen ions (protons). Hyaluronic acid is called an acid because it's a large molecule and part of it contains what's called a [carboxyl group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxylic_acid), also known as carboxylic acid, which is a very weak acid. As for the plumping of skin and minimizing wrinkles, it's used an injected filler material or in many cosmetic products. It occurs naturally in our bodies and is an important chemical that helps lubricate our joints, fills the spaces between our cells, and repairs skin and helps keep skin moisturized.
Mostly holdover from back when the only measure we had of alcohol content was "proofing" which was if I am not mistaken taking a small sample and burning it. The length of time it took to burn gave you the proof number. Now we know that a proof is approximately equal to half a percentage of ABV, but laws put in place regarding alcohol are up to 100 years old (maybe older, yay prohibition) and so labeling is, well, so last century.
Did you seriously just copy and paste your homework question links and all?
Cook time matters for some ingredients, particularly in short-duration, high-heat cooking, because the flavor compounds are not released all at once. Think about making a cup of tea. Brew it for the proper time, and you'll get a nice pleasant mild taste. Brew it too long, and it will become bitter and tart.
>Shouldn’t it depend on the substance?      It does, you're correct.  >1 mL= 1 cubic cm = 1 gram      This only applies to substances with a density of exactly 1g/cm^3
Glass is inert as shit. Aluminum cans have plastic linings that are easily tasted, especially when they contain an acidic substance like soda. Fountain drinks are usually made with tap water and have a tap-watery taste.
The taste you recognize as salt does not come from Na bonded to Cl. It mostly just comes from the Na+ ion. You can have different sodium salts and they all tend to have a salty flavor. If you take raw dry salt and put it on your tongue, it dissociates in the water on your tongue.
There's several methods to measure at a distance. There's pyrometers, which are in essence just really enduring thermometers... These can go up to like 3000° There's infrared thermometers which basically use a lense to focus incoming light from the object which heats a "thermopile". This heat can create electricity and that's how you convert the electricity into usable temperature numbers. Theres also the method of black body radiation. Molecules move at different rates depending on the heat. Near absolute zero it pretty much stands still. The hotter the more molecules vibrate. This releases infrared radiation which you can't see with the naked eye, this black body radiation is the phenomenon why metal glows red if it is hot, it's seeing the phenomenon in action. This last one in particular you use to measure temperatures of stars, as you can measure the brightness and get a damn good idea how hot the given star must be, which is why you use the Kelvin scale in astronomy, and why that starts at ~~273~~ 0. Because that's absolute zero as it starts counting at the very bottom...  We can also figure out based on how light interacts with atmospheres what sort of atmospheres a planet has. So we can get a better idea how the temperatures should be there..as the radiation / molecules vibrate pretty consistently and much of it you can test here on earth kinda.
Trapped air and a higher mineral content makes ice white. Clear ice is made from pure water. I don't know what else I can say but reddit thinks this answer is too short. It is something that is very easy to Google though, so perhaps the question doesn't belong here. I hope this is long enough now. Ice is white because of trapped air and a high mineral content.
Grapefruit can actually interact with a lot of different kinds of medication. This is because of how the medication rangers your body/your blood. Put simply, when you take a pill and it dissolves in your stomach, some of it enters the blood stream, and some of it is metabolized, or broken down.  Scientists account for this and make the pills the size they are knowing that only a certain amount of it will make it into the blood stream (where most medications need to go to spread around the body and take effect). But, grapefruit juice has a special compound that actually blocks the process that metabolizes some of the medicine. As a result, more of it enters your blood, more than what scientists/doctors planned for/expect.  This can be dangerous with some medicines because it’s gives you more than the expected safe dose, or with other medicines it can chase all of it to enter your blood more rapidly, instead of gradually over a longer period of time.
Fats. Cheese and meats have an amount of fat in them that liquefies when its heated up. Fat tends to have a lower boiling point then the rest of the solids in your cheese/pepperoni so the fat separates out and becomes that grease. Its one of the reasons you dont usually want to microwave cheese.
If you take something built out of Lego bricks, it's easier to take it apart than break an individual Lego brick.  Similarly, the forces within an atom are much much stronger than the forces holding atoms to each other.
When you look at rough surface of a transparent material that is located in a medium that has a different refractive index, the light will be scattered in all directions and the surface will appear white. For example, you have a flat and smooth piece of transparent glass. If you take a hammer and crush that glass into powder, the pile of powder will appear white and opaque, even though it is exactly same glass - just not smooth anymore. Now, refractive indices are: Air - 1.00 Window Glass - 1.52 Liquid water - 1.33 Ice - 1.31 So, you can see that there is a significant difference between air and ice. This allows you to see the surface. If you did not take extra care to make sure ice cubes are very smooth, you will see an opaque surface. Now, place those same ice cubes into water. 2 things will happen: 1. Difference in refractive index is now 15 times smaller. This alone makes them a lot less opaque. You have noted that when you look closely the surface can be seen - this is because while small, difference in refractive index remains. 2. Since water is not perfectly at a freezing point, when coming at contact with ice it will transfer some heat onto its surface. It will cause a layer of ice surface to melt, leaving the surface smoother than it was before. This will also make it more transparent.  Now, if you take the pile of powdered glass and add it to water, you will notice that same glass powder is now less opaque - the difference in refractive index is now smaller.
Canned foods are sterilized and then sealed in an air-tight environment, so they won't breed bacteria. Once you open them, they are no longer air tight and bacteria are able to get in and start growing.
We can drink water with salt. Of course we can. We can't drink sea water though, because its too salty. Its the amount of salt that matters.
There are several reasons: 1. You have to make sure your active ingredient reaches the point where it should be absorbed without being digested/destroyed first. If you want the active ingredient to reach the colon you have to put something around it that doesn't get resolved in the stomach. 2. Handability: Working with very small amounts of a substance because every little mistake produces a big error. It's easier to dilute the substance and use more of the diluted substance. 3. Dexterity: Most people have problems seeing and picking up small objects. So a tablet should be large enough that even a person with bad eye sight and some dexterity issues. Even the best medicine does nothing if you can't take it. 4. Marketing and the placebo effect: Everybody has a image in mind how medicine should look and taste like. Medicine that doesn't fits in the picture is harder to sell and is often times less effective than medicine that does. So pharma companies make sure everything looks and tastes familiar.
Sliding the lid doesn't disturb the oil. If it splashes, you introduce a much much higher surface area of burning fluid in contact with oxygen from the air. Splashes are literally the worst thing you can do. Slide the lid over, let it suffocate itself out. If it's safe to, carefully taking it outside isn't a bad idea, but it's hella dangerous. Youre carrying a bucket of burning fuel. If you can, just suffocate it out. Fire blankets are great, and if you fry food at home, buying one can save your entire families lives. They're not expensive. (some lids don't suffocate it completely, let too much air in and it doesn't go out properly.)
Let's say that your Grandma has a special recipe for making a chocolate cake. She won't tell anyone what it is. If you're a good baker, you can eat the cake and go "I think I can taste a bit of coffee in there, there's obviously flour and eggs and butter and cocoa powder, is that a dash of cinnamon?" and use your knowledge of baking to try and make something very very similar to your Grandma's cake.  But without her recipe, you won't get something 100% perfect, because you don't know exactly what she uses, how much of each ingredient, the order she adds them, how long she cooks it and at what temperature. You can still make a very similar chocolate cake because you know how cakes work in general, and can guess specifics based on the taste. But without a full recipe, you can't copy it perfectly. That's roughly the same for Coca-Cola. Other soda makers can figure out something very similar, but they can't get the taste 100% correct.
Because your body is mostly Carbon and Hydrogen, when you burn the body, that carbon and hydrogen burns with the oxygen to form CO2 and H20,  Both of those things turn to gases and go up the chimney, only leaving behind the stuff that doesn’t turn to a gas
Firstly matter can absolutely be ‘destroyed’, people often get this confused because energy is conserved. Atomic nuclei can undergo a process called fission, this is where a nucleus (the parent) splits into two or more lighter ones (the daughters). When heavy nuclei fission into lighter ones they release energy, this energy is associated with a mass via E=mc^2, the mass of the daughter nuclei is slightly smaller than the mass of the original nucleus which corresponds to that energy released.  Nuclear bombs work by a chain reaction. When you hit a uranium nucleus with a neutron, it will fission. This releases energy, daughter nuclei and 3 more neutrons. These neutrons go on to strike more uranium nuclei which themselves fission and release more neutrons which strike more uranium and so on. Every stage of this releases energy as heat. In a nuclear bomb this is uncontrolled, the reaction keeps going and accelerating until the energy released blows the bomb apart and halts the chain reaction, and also blowing up everything in the surrounding area.
If you mean a standard lamp with a wick, you light it with a match or lighter. The initial heat to vaporize the fuel comes from that fire.  As the fire catches, the heat released heats the kerosene in the wick to the flash point.  This is pretty much true of all fires started deliberately. The initial heat must be fed into the fuel until it can become self sustaining.
It is a fairly unstable molecule and exposure to light causes it to break down into normal water. The brown bottle is simply meant for it to be opaque and keep it safe from light.
Also: the expiration date is set somewhat arbitrarily, and marks the end of the period of time tested. The test period is generally selected to account for storage time required for manufacturing and distribution, in a case like hand sanitizer, there's probably some consideration of the typical "lifespan" of a container in the consumer's possession. It would also assume recommended storage conditions; container closed, at room temperature. Exceeding the expiration date simply means no data exists to support its continued efficacy, and it's likely to be good well beyond that date.
When you make huge batches, bad products get mixed with good ones and they average out to an okay product. Milk does this to minimize the effect of bad milk from a cow. Other products add flavor to match their brand flavor. You probably found that orange juice has consistent flavor for each brand but each brand's flavor is different. Each brand has a specific mix of flavor usually derived from parts of the orange like the rind that is mixed to processed orange juice (processed to mostly sugar water). The flavoring and processed juice can be stored for long periods of time before mixing. This allows each brand to always taste similar throughout the year.
Well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that, *yes*, just as your eyes have a limited variety of cones in them and infer other colors based on how those colors activate combinations of cones, your nose has a limited variety of olfactory receptors in it and infers other odors based on how those odors activate combinations of olfactory receptors. The bad news is that while there are only 3 types of cones in our eyes, our best guess for the number of types of olfactory receptors in our noses is "about 400". For each of those 400 different types of receptors, you'd need to find a chemical that activates that one and mostly doesn't activate any of the others.  There's no guarantee that such chemicals will exist in all cases, so you'll probably end up needing more than 400.  (For example, if you can't find a chemical that activates "only receptor #298" then you may need one that activates "only receptors #1 and #298", another that activates "only receptors #2 and #298", and so on.)
No. Part of the reason for cooking foods is that the cooking process makes some of the components of the food more available for absorption and use. Its not adding anything, just causing some changes. Starches can become sugars. The sugar is easier for your body to use, so you get more nutrition/calories from it. If you ate the pre-cooked high starch ingredient you wouldn't be able to break down and absorb as much.  Its similar with cooking meat. The cooking process alters the meat breaking down some of the tougher parts making it easier for your body to break down and digest.
Hydrogen fuel exploits the combustion of hydrogen - a reaction between it and oxygen. This reaction forms water. The idea is a fuel made without waste, burned without waste, and safe to throw straight on the ground without risk. *My* question is, what do we do with the oxygen?
If you can measure the result with very little material, then you are not wasting any of that material that could be used for other experiments.  Also when experiments outcomes are unknown, it's best to keep the possibility of an "unintended rapid disassembly" of your equipment to a minimum. Aka I like my eyebrows on my face ;-)
You wouldn’t insert, but you’d use something in the same column as stuff in the same column has similar properties. The elements are in numerical order so inserting new elements isn’t a thing.  You can have fictional isotopes with unique properties.
Cooking the food kills the microbes living in it which are making it go off.  Once it's cooked and its temperature goes down, new microbes can move in (unless you've hermitically sealed it, like they do with tin cans) but it takes some time for them to multiply and cause problems.
Filler. Things that make it dissolve either faster or slower. excipients. Benign stuff to add space and make the pill larger. Sometimes tiny pills are hard to swallow and may dissolve in your mouth when the intent is the stomach, or farther down the line.
First of all, i do not speak english so i'm sorry if i'm not always grammaticly correct :). oil is a (semi-)transparent liquid. when light hits it, a small part of it is reflected and the rest just passes through. because a pool of oil does not have exactly the same thickness and direction of movement everywhere, the amount of light that is reflected is not the same everywhere. This creates the different colors we can see. Of course there are also other issues such as the interference of light waves that alter the received colour, but I won't go into that.
Amino acids and proteins could have formed on the early Earth, the Miller-Urey experiment proved it was possible for these building blocks of life to form creating the primordial soup from which life could have spawned. - https://youtu.be/Kq3Os00pPJM
"Dryness" usually refers to the conversion of almost all sugars into alcohol, but the dry sensation you often get with red wines is due to tannins in the wine. You also get them in tea.  The tannins bind to the proteins in your saliva, causing a bit of puckering that feels like dryness.
You are correct and the vinegar and baking soda immediately neutralize each other.  Those solutions are written by people who don't understand chemistry, think "the fizzing means it's working!", and don't realize they're essentially just cleaning with water (which is a perfectly good solvent for many messes). Then they get repeated from blog to blog as everyone just copies what everyone else is saying.
The starch from the rice acts as a mild abrasive, which aids in removing dirt, grime, oils, soap residue that normally wouldn’t come off with water alone.
The cooling of the egg firms and contracts the egg's white pulling the membrane away from the shell of the egg.
The healthy vegetable oils are generally considered healthy(er) because they have unsaturated fats (their fat molecules don't have all the hydrogen on them that they're capable of holding). Saturated fats (usually from animals) tend to have worse cholesterol/health effects. In order to turn vegetable oils (liquid at room temperature) into margerine (solid-ish at room temperature) you need to saturate the fats...add the missing hydrogens. This raises the melting point and makes the fat "harder", it's why lard or butter is solid at room temperature. It also chemically converts the vegetable oils from an unsaturated to saturated fat, so it's a lot closer to the less-healthy-ish fats than the original vegetable oil you started with.
Things only rust when exposed to oxygen so no. It can still degrade (much slower) from radiation wich is much more nasty in space when there is no athmosphere protecting you.
You won’t cause any damage. Both are safe for human external use. Shower gels normally have more surfactants to clean than shampoos, and shampoos would often have conditioners like silicon to envelop the hair strands, but they are both safe and won’t cause health issues. Your hair might end up drier/more tangled than usual.
Soap's real easy to understand, actually. You know how oil and water don't mix?  Well, soap has molecules that have one side hydrophobic (this side doesn't like water, it likes oil) and another side that is hydrophilic (this side likes water).  So soap molecules grab onto fats and oils on one side, then water grabs onto the soap from the other side, and washes it away.  That's pretty much it.
It was cheese. Then it was modified to give it more desirable properties, like the ability to squirt out from a can or melt at lower temperature.
Quick (Ramen) answer: Instant ramen is already boiled, and then they deep fry it so it's crunchy like potato chips and you just need to get it soggy again.  Regular pasta needs to get soggy all the way through, and then heat it up enough that the starch soaks the water back up and makes it into a pasta texture.  --- Food science (Pasta) answer: Think of the starch in pasta like a heat activated sponge, so it's tiny and crunchy when it's cold, and won't expand even if it gets wet, but then when you get it hot it spreads out like a sponge and can soak things up and it's soft. Just heating it up won't expand it though, if you just heated up you just scorch the little pellet rather than expanding it because life likes to make things hard for you.  The sponges in the ramen have already been expanded, they're just dry right right now. The sponges in the pasta still need to get hot with access to water for a while before they can soak stuff up. As was pointed out by somebody in the comments, you can actually soak uncooked pasta to rehydrate it, it just takes forever, and it still won't really be tasty unless you bring it up to a boiling temperature to activate the starches. This does allow for cooking really quick batches of pasta though, and it plays into why fresh pasta cooks so much faster than dried.
Calories are increasing per gram, since you're removing water which has no calories but adds weight.
Will they run out of electrons? No, because when an electron exits the solar panel, another will enter the solar panel at the other end of the circuit. Solar panels are a circuit, think of it like electricity flowing in a circle, with solar energy being used to push the electrons around the circle. So no, they won’t ever run out of electrons. But yes they can just break down normally (like say parts rusting)
It is sort of true that they get the exact amount of the active ingredient by adding a larger amount to a batch but the batch is mixed up very well and they test the methods for mixing the batch to ensure that it is almost perfectly uniform to ensure that each pill have the same amount of drugs in it.
That depends a lot on the exact medicine you want to make and how much risk you want to take. You can compare it to illegal drug labs which basically does the same. In fact some public recepies for perscription medicine which you can make at home use illegal drugs as a base to start from.
One of the things your microbiome does is compete for resources with foreign microbes. It's highly possible that most of the people reading this have MRSA on us. But the skin fauna is so prevalent on your skin, the MRSA has a hard time catching up. When you use antimicrobial wash, you wipe the skin mostly clean, and the fauna has to repopulate. It's during this time that the MRSA has a chance to get ahead. It's a slim chance, but the more often to do it, the more you risk it happening.
Vinegar is acetic acid (4-8%) and the rest water. All vinegars are the result of double fermentation.  The first fermentation is when yeasts turn the sugars and starches in any aqueous solution (potatoes, fruits, grapes, grains, etc) into alcohol. The second fermentation is when bacteria turn the alcohol into acetic acid.  A bottle of wine can turn into vinegar and become red or white wine vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is the result of apples fermented into an alcohol beverage (cider) and the fermented again into an acetic acid solution. The apples leave more than just water behind and that's why it's a different color and taste from standard vinegar.
The smoke is acidic and the meat becomes filled with acid. You do not notice it much when mixing it with saliva in your mouth as this dilutes the acid. However bacteria and mold does not have this luxury and are unable to live in the acidic environment. It should be noted however that smoking is usually only part of the way to preserve meat. The smoking process usually dries the meat as well which helps preserve it. And you need to keep it in a dry and preferably colder place in order to preserve it enough. It is not uncommon to salt the meat as well.
I believe the solids settle, and the runny stuff goes to the top. Give er a quick shake before using it.
Sub rules ask that you [search first](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/hxcf80/eli5_why_isnt_water_flammable_its_made_of_a/) - "water hydrogen" or "water flammable" bring up [a bunch](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/hxcf80/eli5_why_isnt_water_flammable_its_made_of_a/) of copies of this question.
The surface is far too un-uniform for almost all substances to get any meaningful contact welding and you trap a lot of air between the surface because of the unevenness. It happens but it's so few atoms actually bond that you really don't notice. If you have a very (very!) flat surface in a vacuum, you can indeed get them to weld together.
Asbestos is a very fiberous/stringy mineral that is dug out of the ground.  Think fiber glass but from a pit in the ground. It was dirt cheap, fire resistant, and fairly strong.  It was a great way to reinforce things like tiles without needing to pay for fiberglass like we do today.  It was also fire resistant so it was used in garments a lot to help keep them heat/fire resistant.  Similar to fiber glass it also went into lots of insulations because you could make it nice and fluffy and it'd stop heat transfer. Bad news, turns out it also breaks off into itty bitty little fibers that you breathe in.  These fibers get stuck in your lungs and cause a special cancer in the lining of your lungs and chest wall called Mesothelioma.  Over 80% of cases are tied to Asbestos exposure, the link is super strong which is why *If you or a loved one have suffered from Mesothelioma you may be entitled to compensation....*
It's important to understand that the brain has natural cannabinoids. These are called endocannabinoids. Their function is to calibrate the excitatory-inhibitory tone. Here's a simple analogy: on an old TV, there are color dials where you can adjust the saturation of red, green and blue. Endocannabinoids are the color dials of the brain. More specifically, they balance the levels of GABA (inhibitory) and glutamate (excitatory). When you use phytocannabinoids (from plants), you are throwing off the balance. You are turning the dials up and down. This can have positive or negative effects. It very much depends. CBD is a cannabinoid that shifts the balance to a more inhibitory state. This is good if you have epilepsy. Epileptic seizures are caused by hyper-excitation, so you want more inhibition. A CBD drug (Epidiolex) has actually been FDA-approved to treat some forms of epilepsy. THC is a cannabinoid that shifts the balance to a more excitatory state. This is bad if you have schizophrenia. In schizophrenia, there is hyperactivity of dopamine pathways, leading to psychosis. Research shows that cannabis can trigger psychoses (and possibly even schizophrenia), with high-THC strains carrying the biggest risk. On the other hand, CBD actually seems to reduce the risk of psychosis.
They... Don't? That's why they have whistles, so you know when they're boiling
Painkillers bind with receptors in the brain, preventing pain signals from the body reaching them and being processed into the subjective experience of 'pain' itself. So the drugs don't know where to kill the pain, they simply turn off the brains ability to recognise pain in the body as a whole
The simple answer would be "no". Even if we could synthesise all the chemical compounds in an apple, we would still need to arrange those chemicals in the exact way they are found in real apples. Apple are organic objects, with cells and processes that are so immensely complex, recreating them is nearly impossible.
Acidity describes a substance with a low pH (how many hydrogen ions it has), as opposed to a base. Lots of things that are acidic are not toxic. Lemons, for example. Toxicity usually describes any substance (acidic or otherwise) that's harmful or deadly to human/animal life.
You shoot pressurized co2 and it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, but this reaction is reversible so it slowly comes back out in the form of bubbles The speed at which co2 comes out is limited, so it can’t immediately all come out of solution at once in one big bubble Bubbles however like to generate more where there is a cavitation site, typically a cavity or an air bubble, which is why when you shake a bottle it all fizzes up, you added more bubbles and more nucleation sites, another way to do that is to introduce a lot of small cavities like the surface of a mentos.
We can, if you burn hydrogen gas your waste product is water.  The challenge is finding a ready source of hydrogen.  Overall the need to manufacture water is low given the natural abundance of it.
Salmonella and e. Coli are both intestinal bacteria that may be spread by rupturing the intestine during slaughter. Therefore, a good sear is needed to kill anything on the outside and you're good to go. With chicken, salmonella requires either a higher temp or longer time at lower temp.  Trichinosis was the big scare with pork, so higher temps were recommended to kill it;  but this is such a dated idea that may not even hold any merit. It all boils down to cultural norms and old laws. Check out [this article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/complex-origins-food-safety-rules/) for some history.
No, they stay together but the molecules of water come apart from other molecules of water.  When they cool and come together again they form liquid water.
I can actually explain this to a 5 year old, because I have a kid on the meds and explained it to her. Here's the gist of it.  Imagine a classroom. 20 kids, one teacher. The teacher is asleep at the desk. The kids, noticing this, take the opportunity to go absolutely ape shit. They are all over the place, running around, totally amped up at the lack of authority. How do you fix this problem? You wake the teacher up. Teacher wakes up, can settle the kids down, get them back on task.  Stimulants wake up the Teacher, the executive function. The kids, the random stray thoughts and distractions we all have all the time, can't be excited anymore than they already are. So to get them back in line, you wake up the teacher. The current medications do exactly this over a long period of time. You can imagine with some proper wording, that this very analogy would be understood by even a 5 year old, since every kid knows what happens when the teacher steps out of class for a minute. Edit: I'm glad my overly simplified answer to this question helped a few people out. It's how I explained it to my daughter when she started her meds. To some of you who have been unwittingly self medicating with caffeine your entire life, this is why you don't think well until you've had your coffee in the morning. I have self medicated with caffeine my entire life as well without realizing it.  I'm no authority on the subject, but I learned a few things along the way. The diagnosis is multi-layered. It is not a single test or person. Teachers are, I will say typically since I can't be certain in every state, not allowed to tell a parent that their kid may have an attention disorder. My daughters 2nd grade teacher was dropping hints, but we knew when my daughter was 4 or 5 there was an issue. When we told her teacher she would be seeing the doctor, she said thank god, because she was not allowed to say anything to us by law, because she is not a medical professional. So don't expect the teacher to come to you. They will also take input from at least 2 or 3 places to determine the course of action, not just one. How do you know if you kid has ADHD or some form of disorder? Go to their school play, like for Christmas, like a sing along type thing. All the kids will be in a line on stage, singing for the parents which fill the rest of the room. Your kid, is off in a corner, spinning around on their side on the floor, still singing the sing mind you, but totally out to lunch otherwise. Her teachers tell you, she basically crawls around the classroom and makes forts underneath the desks, and when asked a question, she has been listening the entire time and just spit out the answer like fort making is just a thing we do here. I could go on but I don't want to get preachy. But suffice to say, sometimes, you just know.
You see color when light strikes an object. Some of the wavelengths of the light  (what we see as colors) are absorbed by the object. Others are reflected back to your eyes. A lemon looks yellow because the yellow wavelengths enter your eye. When fabric is wet, there's a layer of water on it. Let's say you spilled water on your cool green t-shirt. The extra layer of water bounces some of the green light back into the fabric itself, so there's less of it to reach your eyes. Less light reaching your eyes = a darker appearance.
The elastic eventually dries out, like with any kind of rubber. A tire left out in the elements will deteriorate (albeit very slowly), latex rubber gloves dry out after so long, etc.
Aluminium foil has low thermal mass (it's volume to surface area ratio is low) and high thermal conductivity (heat transfers in and out of it very quickly). It does heat up, very quickly in fact and will feel hot to the touch, but it dissipates what little heat it retains in a short period
The heat from the road creates a layer of hot, less-dense air above it. Light travelling from the cooler air above through the warmer air refracts, bending light from the horizon or sky towards you, thus why it has a lighter color.  The glossy effect is because the hot air is less dense and rising, being replaced by cooler air which is then heated by the road, creating a moving cycle which alters the exact amount of refraction occurring and thus making it look all shimmery.  The refraction only bends light so much though and thus usually requires a low viewing angle for light from the sky to be seen. As you get closer, the viewing angle increases, so even with the refraction, the light hitting your eyes is coming from the road instead of the sky, thus it no longer has the bright, watery look.
If it’s any similar to some other hormones like the HPA axis, it’s because there’s only a very low amount of that chemical circulating in your body at a time. Most of it is produced in your brain and used a very short distance ‘downstream’ from there, which effectively leads to undetectable amounts in the wider circulation. So if you took a blood sample from someone’s arm like we normally do, you would hardly detect the chemical, let alone be able to tell if there’s an imbalance. You’d have to take a blood sample inside the brain between the two specific points where the chemical is produced and absorbed again, to be able to tell anything at all. That being said, things like depression or adhd are usually caused by neurotransmitter problems. They are molecules that you find in the brain and that allow one neurone to communicate with the next, but they are not found in blood much at all. So again you’d have to somehow sample the connection between two neurones to measure the amount of neurotransmitter. An easier way to do it is to monitor the effect of drugs that affect neurotransmitters. If you give them SSRIs (serotonin reuptake inhibitors), what you are doing is forcing serotonin to be present for a longer time before it is reabsorbed, thereby making sure the signal travels correctly from one neurone to the next. Normal people will react differently to the drug compared to depressed people with a serotonin deficiency as it were. Compare it to to adhd meds: normal people on adderall act all high, while people with adhd on adderall are able to calm down
We cannot date say a stone arrowhead using radiocarbon dating. Radiocarbon dating only works with organic material as it relies on there being a time when this object took carbon from its surroundings, which usually means it was a living thing. Suppose we did find the remains of wood from an arrow alongside the arrowhead. We can date the wood itself, it would date the wood to when the tree it was made from was growing rather than the time when the arrow was made but that’s a good enough estimate.
I feel like this is too subjective. Quality marijuana is pervasive as fuuuuuck and can smell up a few rooms of a house just as easily.
"Safe" is relative. There is an old saying in pharmacology, "The dose makes the poison." Everything is poisonous in some excess amounts, even water poisoning is possible, but the problem with those drugs is the addition aspect. Sure, it is possible to use a bit of heroin and probably walk away without any long term side effects, but it is addictive and will have you try to use more and more, destroying your life without killing you or you taking too much and having an overdose. For instance, Fentanyl is prescribed in the US as a pain relief drug. I see no reason heroin couldn't be similarly beside fentanyl/morphine already covering those niches better.
Intermolecular forces determine these points (how strongly stuff is held together) Pressure will also increase or decrease these numbers. Lower pressure = easier to turn into a gas for example.
It is possible.  Different fuels burn at different temperatures, with a different amount of energy released.  If the burning fuel puts off such a small amount of energy that the fire isn't able to stay hot enough to continue burning, the fuel will go out.  For instance, some kinds of jet fuel can't burn at room temperature for this reason, they need to be at very high temperature and pressure to sustain combustion.  Diesel fuel also is very hard (but not impossible) to keep burning at atmospheric conditions.   If the atmospheric conditions aren't sufficient to keep a fire burning, they will also not allow to fire to start.
What determines meat color is the amount of myoglobin in the tissue of the meat.  Myoglobin is the protein responsible for transferring oxygen around within an animal's muscles.   The muscles that people like to eat from cows are have very high levels of myoglobin in them, which causes them to look red when exposed to air. People eat a wider variety of muscles on birds - both eating muscles that have a lot of myoglobin (dark meat) and those that don't (white meat). People eat the same muscles on pigs that they do on cows.  But pigs are much less active than cows and most of their muscles have myoglobin levels that are a bit higher than white meat poultry, but much less than what you find in dark meat poultry or cows. The vast majority of pork that is sold in supermarkets has been preserved with carbon monoxide.  That carbon monoxide binds to myoglobin in place of oxygen and produces a very bright red color - even muscle tissue with limited amounts of myoglobin in it will appear quite red before being cooked when exposed to carbon monoxide because myoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is a very strong pigment.  Cooking the meat causes the carbon monoxide to be replaced with normal oxygen, causing it to revert to its normal color - which in the case of pork is very light pink.   Carbon monoxide is also used to preserve poultry, which is why chicken tends to go from bright pink to white when cooked.
Yes. The whole point of the metric system is to do away with ambiguous bullshit like that. Any SI unit you see is the same everywhere.
It's not the same amount. The wax is burning and turning into water, carbon dioxide, and other trace molecules.
They're the exact same, but fruit has fibre in it. Fibre slows the rate which sugar is digested. It prevents a sugar spike and crash. That's why things like orange juice aren't as healthy as people think they are, because even though its natural sugar there's no fibre left.
One of the theories is that hallucinations, hearing things/voices, delusions and feeling things that aren't there is connected to your brain producing too much dopamine, so some antipsychotics slow down the production of it. But in all truth not a whole lot is known about psychosis or even the medication used to treat it. This is atleast what my psychiatrists have told me.
Strange answers here, but ELI15: Serotonin contributes to mood, but it isn't a "happiness hormone", and depression is not a "neurotransmitter deficiency". Just increasing the amount of serotonin in a synapse does not necessarily make you happy, nor sad. Overdose with an antidepressant that increases this concentration can lead to severe effects. Feelings of sadness is not the only possible outcome in overdose (let alone a common one, in severe overdose) - you can experience depression, psychosis, mania or even die from a significant rise in bodily temperature. **Slightly expanded**: An overdose of a serotonin reuptake inihibiting (SRI) antidepressant is not the same as an overdose of serotonin. There is no easy way to get serotonin from outside of the body into the brain, for example, an injection of serotonin would not reach the brain. Most serotonin in your body exists in the gut, and it is an important messenger involved with blood flow, particularly constriction of veins. While increased by these drugs, concentration of serotonin does not discretely correlate with happiness. It takes weeks of dosing for the mood-altering effects of these drugs to become apparent. There are numerous competing theories as to why. Overdose of an antidepressant affecting serotonin clearance (or metabolism) in the synapse can lead to serotonin syndrome. In mild cases, typically only minor seizure-like activity is present (eg. ~~clonus~~ muscle contractions, tremor, pronounced reflexes). As severity increases, effects such as life-threatening fever, loss of consciousness and respiratory failure are present. This typically requires an overdose of multiple serotonin-acting drugs (eg. metabolic inhibitors with reuptake inhibitors, typically MAOIs and SRIs). Feelings of sadness and anxiety are not exclusive to or specifically exacerbated in SRI overdose, they are among the most common side-effects.
This question is a repost and probably the best answer you will find is in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1jyeao/eli5_why_do_amphetamines_suppress_appetite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
This question is basically "ELI5: Chemistry". The different behaviors of the elements come from the fact that a fixed number of *protons* means that a neutral element also has a fixed number of *electrons*. Since electrons organize themselves into different energy levels with a very complicated structure, the interaction of those electrons seeking the lowest-energy state available to them is similarly complicated. The full story requires quantum mechanics, relativity, *and* some very complex computations on top of them.
Because the soda you get form a machine isn’t quite the same as the soda from the bottle. Restaurants get packs of the soda syrup that they hook up to the machine, which the machine then mixes with water and adds the carbonation right then and there as you push the lever.  This means that the carbonation is less throughly mixed/dissolved in the soda. There is less carbonation in soda from the machine than bottled soda.
Let's try a metaphor. Imagine there is a really deep valley between two mountains. On either side beyond the mountains you're at sea level but the valley between the two like -2000 feet below sea level, like Death Valley or something. This is a metaphor for the "Stability" of a molecule, the higher above sea level the less stable and the deeper below sea level the more stable. If the starting pieces of the molecule are on either sides of the mountains they are pretty happy, sea level is a pretty stable place. Since the mountains are pretty high the pieces are never just going to "jump over the mountains" on their own. BUT if you give them energy they can fly over the mountains and land in the valley between, which is super deep and a super happy place for the pieces to exist. That energy input is the "endothermal" part of the chemistry and the valley between is the new, super happy molecule.
Yeast is a living organism (a fungus), sugars are its food. It consumes the sugar, among its byproducts it expels CO2 and ethanol.  Not really a detailed explanation but I think you're overthinking things unless you really want a simplified visual of the exact biological processes going on.
We use oxygen by "burning" carbohydrates in our body and using the energy released in the process. Carbon from these molecules turns into CO2 (which is useless for the organism and gets released) and hydrogen turns into water.
A Base is the chemical opposite of an Acid, having a PH of higher than 7. Acids are proton donors, and bases are proton accepters(the opposite is true for electrons). They form bonds and chemical reactions this way. In terms of what the properties of a Base is, it varies a bit by each chemical and its concentration in a solution. All bases will react with and neutralize acids, and strong bases, like strong acids, can be very corrosive and destructive to a number of organic molecules that make up our bodies when concentrated, lipids in particular(lipids are a group of molecules that includes oils, fats, and our cell membranes). A few even generate heat when reacting. This also makes them great for cleaning and disinfecting, Bleach being an example.
Most drinks should be staying mixed on their own? Unless you have pulp or coffee grains or something that is large enough to sink to the bottom of the bottle. The answer here is that they are never really mixed in to begin with. If you mix milk in with your coffee no amount of time or will give you unmixed coffee with milk floating on the top. If you don't mix it properly you may have some extra sugar or coffee grounds at the bottom tho. Mix your drinks better!
If you smash a proton into a larger nucleus with enough force there’s a small chance an antiproton can be generated as a result.
The light is caused by a chemical reaction that happens when the two liquids mix  Cooling them down slows or even stops this reaction
Corrosion is an electrochemical event. There is a certain electrical potential difference between the water and a given piece/type of metal. The potential difference between the water and zinc (for example) is larger than that between water and steel (example). So the zinc will corrode first, because it’s preferable to do so (the bigger the potential difference, the more energy “released” by the reaction, which makes it more favorable). The size of the material doesn’t matter, because the whole boat (zinc and hull) are connected and act sort of like a giant circuit/capacitor. So long as you have zinc exposed to the water and connected to the steel hull, your hull will be relatively safe.
Tastes are just comprised of a collection of chemicals that your taste buds interact with and your brain interprets as a flavor. These chemicals can be artificially derived in a factory,  like any other chemical.
People often assumed that a blocked nose is because of snot. It's not. When your nose really has that blocked feeling that isn't relieved by blowing your nose, it's because the tissue inside your nose is inflamed and swollen. The swelling obstructs your nasal passages so air can no longer get through (or at least it's much harder). If you can reduce the swelling, that opens up your nasal passages to breathe through. One way to do this is through physical exercise. When your body goes into "physical activity mode", it directs more blood to your muscles. That blood has to come from somewhere, and one of the places that the body sends less blood to is your nose. Less blood in your nose means less swelling. Another way is to "trick" your body into "activity mode", at least locally. Certain nasal sprays contain chemicals that mimic adrenaline, the body's "action hormone". Applying this fake adrenaline to your nose causes the blood vessels there to constrict (become narrower), directing blood away from the nose just as if you were really doing physical exercise, and thus again reducing the swelling and letting your breathe more easily. Menthol doesn't seem to have this effect, as far as my limited research can tell me (e.g. [link](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11882-003-0041-6.pdf)). People *feel* like it helps decongest their nose, but objective measurements of airflow tell a very different story - if anything menthol (being a mild irritant) seems to cause more congestion. So why do people feel like it works? Menthol does seem to have a mild soothing effect, so that might make it less painful for you to breathe through your stuffy inflamed nose (unless you overdo it, in which case the menthol can become irritating). In addition, the cool sensation that menthol provides (because it actually activates cold receptors in the body) may trick you into feeling like more air is coming in through your nose, when it isn't (because you more clearly feel the air moving through your nose, and breathing freely is normally associated with a slight cooling of your nasal passages as well as the air you breathe is usually colder than you are).
It only hardens in contact with the air. In the bottle there isn't enough air, or enough surface area of the polish, for it to harden like it does on your nails
Because heat gets transfered "naturally" from hot objects to cold objects, so any object will eventually get to the same temperature as the air around it (or the water around it if it's submerged in water). So a hot drink is hotter than the ambient air, and will lose its heat to the air.  And a cold drink is colder than the air, and will absorb some heat from the air.
An emulsion is when two liquids that don’t mix or dissolve in each other (immiscible) are put together and then mechanically mixed so that even though they remain separate at a small level, they’re still pretty well mixed. The most familiar example is probably oil and water. Oil will float on top, and stirring a little doesn’t change it. If you stir and shake a lot, the two liquids form droplets that can be all randomly jumbled together.
Garbage incinerators are not uncommon, some even double as power plants. The problem is the second part of your comment. You never really know what you're burning and some stuff produces *nasty* compounds when burned. And worse still, there's many, many different nasty things that need to be removed each with different processes. Filtering or catalyzing them is obviously possible, but not easy and especially not cheap. Even in the best case scenario we're still letting some carcinogens and environmentally harmful chemicals (and the obvious greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere.
1 *mol* of molecules is the number of atoms in 12 grams of Carbon 12. It's also the number of atoms in 1 gram of Hydrogen, but we use Carbon 12 as the standard because it has 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons, and that makes it an ideal substance to use when you want to figure out the average weight of a proton, a neutron, and an electron.
They don't count the amount of energy it takes to process the food, just the amount of energy inside the physical composition of the food.
>But if this was so, wouldn't the surroundings heat up? Yes, that's exactly what happens. Ever hold your hand near a hot drink and feel the heat coming off of it?  "Heat loss" just means heat flows from something hot to something less hot. Heat is lost from your cup into its surroundings; in turn, heat is lost from the surroundings into whatever cooler stuff surrounds *that*, and so on until thermal equilibrium is achieved.
Good question. And anti depressants are notoriously individual. You might not get any of those side effects ever. Or they might start the first week. Or on the fifth month.  I stopped Zoloft on the third day because on dizziness. Wellbutrin has been a lot better, some minor problems with insomnia but fairly good overall.
They don´t.    The only exception I can think of is the typical car battery, where the fluid in the cells can evaporate over time and thus take some of the weight along with it.
Different substances are in different states of matter depending on temperature and pressure. Gasoline can also be a vapor at higher temperatures or freeze and be a solid at lower temperatures.  Similar to water.
Fuck, you'd better hope there isn't a spark, or your lungs will do the Hindenburg. Oh, the humanity.  But in answer to your question: no, it's pseudoscience rubbish. If it were the best and safest way to 'eliminate inflammation', then they'd use it everywhere.  As for the best treatment for every condition... c'mon. You *know* that's bullshit.
Foils also reflect heat back inside. Since the foil is very thin and therefore can't absorb that much heat, it doesn't conduct as much heat away as it keeps heat in.
CANDU reactors typically have a computerized zone controller which varies the moderator density in particular regions of the core to achieve a desired power profile. The control rods can also be used for bulk control when required or to adjust average reactor temperature. But this is not preferred as it is less efficient.  CANDU plants are very different from LWRs. LWRs don’t need any computer based system, and can be adjusted simply by varying steam flow or core cooling rate (based on design).  /u/captaincalandria can explain better
Loaded question appears to be loaded. Have you published your manifesto yet or are you waiting to gauge what the reaction here is like first?
An electron cloud is just an area of probability density where you might be likely to find an electron orbiting a nucleus.in other words, the cloud represents where we think electrons are.
They don't give you those things. They increase the risk, however this increase is small and their benefits are large. Taking a single painkiller won't give you those things in the same way that eating a teaspoon of sugar won't give you diabetes, but prolonged use of them does increase the risk (and similarly for diabetes and sugar which supermarkets also sell).
It has to do with the way water molecules line up when they freeze. Veritasium just did a pretty good video about it. https://youtu.be/ao2Jfm35XeE
Thats possible in theory but an engineering nightmare as those fuels are a wild mix of different chemicals. For that to work properly you'd either need a horribly complicated setup or you'd have to purify the fuels into single molecule types. Also the molecules are much more complex wich poses additional challenges. (Even the most simple hydrocarbon methan is more complex than the super simple H2)
Many radioactive elements aren't that dangerous as long as you aren't getting them inside you, especially dust. The radiation itself may not travel very far. Alpha radiation for example, can be stopped with thick paper, and beta radiation can be stopped with a thick sweater. In a leaded glass jar behind plexiglass, those aren't dangerous.  Even the ones that emit more dangerous kinds of radiation still aren't that bad as long as it's a small piece. Something like uranium would be dangerous if you stood next to a decent chunk, but a tiny little sliver behind glass isn't that dangerous as long as you're not, like, sleeping next to it every night. Uranium is dangerous not because it's super radioactive, but because it remains radioactive for a *long* time.  There are a few, of course, that are very dangerous even in small quantities. There are also a few that just wouldn't last long enough to be worth having before they decayed. Those sorts, you won't find in a permanent fixture. You might find pictures of one set up for pictures, but it isn't something you would buy.  Francium, for example, is dangerously radioactive, with a half life of only 22 minutes. Even if you safely contained it, your sample would be all but gone in days. Worse, it's *violently* reactive with water so unless it's stored very carefully it could explode.
Caffeine does not give you energy.  Not even a little. What it does is keep you from knowing that you are tired. You still are tired and you body still suffers the negative effects of it, but you can't feel it anymore. In addition if you drink too much caffeine too often, your body adjusts itself, so you only feel normal amounts of tired if you have caffeine in your system.  If you don't, like for example right after you wake up in the morning, you will find you are unable to fully awaken without caffeine.
As far as I know, there are only two specific instances where drinking alcohol is directly, as in *medically*, beneficial - 1. Alcohol withdrawal can be lethal. If a chronic alcohol goes cold turkey they can literally die from the lack of alcohol, so small doses of alcohol may be needed to safely wean a recovering alcoholic through withdrawal. 2. Ingestion of Methyl alcohol can be lethal, it's not the methyl alcohol itself but the compound the body digests it into that can kill you. If a someone has ingested toxic amounts of methyl alcohol they can ingest ethyl alcohol (the kind we normally drink), the body will focus on the ethyl alcohol and the methyl alcohol will just pass through the system and be excreted safely.
Tiny cracks and fractures form along the fold line. Light travelling through the different sections of plastic and air in these sections gets scattered by the different materials and appears as white.   It's the same effect as when light is scattered by the tiny scratches and bumps in frosted glass or the water droplets in clouds.
Despite what some have said, when defining the surface area of a porous surface like activated charcoal, you absolutely do run into something directly akin to the coastline paradox. One measures the surface area of a porous surface by essentially covering it in molecules of a known size and shape. The amount of molecules needed to cover the surface tells you how much surface you have. The size of the molecules determines how small the corners and crevices are that the molecules can cover. That is, if you use a big molecule to measure a surface with a lot of very small crevices you will under estimate the total surface area.  There are materials with surface areas of several thousand square meters per gram of material. This is much larger surface than you would predict by simply counting up the surface of spheres.
There are small agitators on the inside of the pump nozzle that the liquid soap hits on the way out of the bottle!
oil, coal, and most ground based hydrocarbons are the result of decaying ocean life (or forests) that existed millions and millions of years ago, that lived and died before fungus came along and worked out how to break them down.  the soil and water at that time would have contained quite a lot of sulphur, phosphor and other gasses that would have been in the atmosphere. , which means that they would have been eaten by that plant life, and thus ended up in the coal/oil/gas. there will naturally be an outgassing of any gasses that accumulate inside the oil, and any water trapped in there will react with these gasses to produce things like sulphur oxide, sulphur hydroxide, and hydrogen sulfide (which is the one that REALLY smells of rotten eggs)..   when they dig down into a well of oil, they're going to naturally end up drilling through a relatively dense pocket of these gasses (which is why there's that "geiser" of oil you see in old west tales..  the pocket of oil is literally pressurised""..  and like any other liquid that's been locked up with pressurised gas, some of that gas is going to be contained within the liquid..  (think of a 2l bottle of soda, where the "soda" is crude oil, and the gas coming out of solution is natural gas/hydrogen sulphide etc)..  most oil wells at sea will have a large flare burning off to one side, which is where they pump any gasses that come out of the well..   there's no way to process them out at sea, and any carbon dioxide produced is a \*lot\* less damaging to the environment than pumping methane out into the atmosphere.  Now.   I'm not going to go into the politics of pollution in the US, nor what the US EPA can and cant dictate when it comes to oil well off gassing, but the gasses that come out of an oil well \*should\* be being filtered,  contained, and dealt with in a \*responsible\* way. .
Because they are polar molecules. The molecule is bent and has an unequal sharing of electrons. So while the molecule as a whole averages to neutral, there are locally positive and locally negative areas.
light thats been refracted into a rainbow is all still just visible light. It's just that different wavelengths have been sent in slightly different directions. None of those visible wavelengths are any more dangerous than all of them together in white light are.
Part of the burning is the from hydration of the water in your skin anyway. To minimise damage you just want to stop all burning as quickly as possible (chemical & thermal).  If you were to pipette water onto the sulphuric acid on your skin then yes you may make the thermal burns worse. However if you douse the area such that the ratio of water to acid is high, then the benefit of washing away the acid, combined with cooling from the water will almost certainly be better. Water is extremely good at adsorbing heat.
The salt isn’t meting the ice. It’s actually lowering the freezing point of water. Technically if the temperature drops low enough, saltwater will freeze.
The stickiness is stuck to the tape. At first. Over time, it becomes stuck to other things instead, like a paper, or the wall, or bits of the air or humidity or dust.
Ultra-violet light can ionize the DNA in cells and break it down, disrupting cell function and eventually killing the bacteria. It also creates small amounts of ozone which can do serious damage to cells. It's used for cleaning because it's a fairly non-invasive way of disinfecting surfaces that doesn't require any toxic or damaging chemicals.
Alcohol is poisonous. Filling your body with poison is generally not a good thing, so your liver has evolved to be able to convert that poisonous alcohol into harmless acetic acid (which can even be further broken down into carbon dioxide, releasing some useful energy in the process - this is why alcohol has calories). Unfortunately, there's an intermediate step here. Alcohol cannot be directly converted to acetic acid, it first has to be converted into something called acetaldehyde, which is *way* more poisonous than alcohol is.  The steps your body goes through after drinking alcohol depends on the quantity of alcohol and acetaldehyde in your blood. When you're drinking, you have a lot of alcohol and not much acetaldehyde, so you get to experience the stuff alcohol does - the fun of your brain not working properly. During a hangover, most of that alcohol is now acetaldehyde, so alcohol is no longer inhibiting your brain's ability to tell itself not to do stuff (including not to feel pain), and instead you get a whole bunch of acetaldehyde toxicity, combined with the pains of dehydration, sleep deprivation and a range of other things that all individually suck and are all going on at the same time.
Cutting onions releases a gas that, when combined with the water on the surface of your eye, creates an acid that burns.
What you are seeing is the sum of all colour pigments in the liquid.   Coffee is a dark shade of brown, almost black.  Milk is white.  Add a little milk and the pigments combine to make a new colour that is a lighter shade of brown than the original dark brown/black.
Electricity passing through water doesn't make the water itself harmful, it is the electricity that is the danger. Our bodies use charge gradients between cells to transfer signals through nerves, and electricity is a massive charge gradient. The result is that when electricity passes through the human body it triggers all kinds of signals at once; muscles contract all at once without stopping, senses go haywire, etc. This can be extremely dangerous for things that we need to operate constantly, such as our heart. Beyond that, electricity experiences resistance in all substances (except superconductors) and that resistance results in heat. Sufficient electricity passing through the body can produce enough heat to damage tissue through actually cooking it, denaturing proteins and chemically altering it permanently. Essentially it is a penetrating burn wherever the path of electricity flowed. So electricity has the potential to be really bad for the human body, but why is it so dangerous with water? This is because normally electricity is confined to things like wires, and as long as you don't touch a hot wire you should be good. Water can conduct electricity though (technically it needs some trace salts or similar ions to be a good conductor, but that is usually the case unless it is highly distilled water). This turns a dangerous wire into a pool of dangerous fluid that covers a much larger area and can flow around in unexpected ways. It is also often not obvious the electrified water is dangerous since it just looks like normal water, but touching it could result in lethal path for electricity to move to ground though your body. And yes, if the electricity is removed then the water is immediately safe to touch (as long as it isn't hot). Think about if you cut the electricity to a wire, the wire is immediately safe to touch because it wasn't somehow altered into a harmful material while it was conducting electricity.
When we say “touch” we usually mean “electron clouds run into each other”. Just because they’re not literally touching doesn’t mean they can’t interact. If the interaction has high attraction, we call that “sticky”.  Actually touching is bad. That’s nuclear fusion.
The simplest answer is when you bake cookies, you're just not heating them anywhere near hot enough to melt anything. Cookie dough is a giant collection of biochemicals (sugars and sugar polymers, proteins, lipids, etc.), and if you just kept cranking the temperature higher and higher, those large molecules would start breaking apart into smaller and smaller molecules until the chemical composition was changed so much that what you have is no longer cookie dough. At a high enough temperature you would drive almost everything except a lump of carbon, which does not melt at *any* temperature at normal atmospheric pressure. You can't melt cookie dough because it would stop being cookie dough before you reached the melting points of its ingredients.
The value of oil is in its energy density.  We can simply set light to it and release lots of energy.  But to get energy dense molecules you have to put energy into the system.  With oil this was done firstly by the plankton that died to form the carbon rich sediment,  and then by geological processes over millions of years that subjected that sediment to high temperatures and pressure for long periods of time.  If you want to do that artificially you have to put all that energy in.  And you have to put more energy in than you will get back out.  So it's a pointless process.
Many dishwashers dry dishes by heating up coils inside the dishwasher. These coils can release enough heat to warp certain plastics or damage the finish on cups or dishes. Usually these coils are on the bottom of the dishwasher so the top rack gets less heat. That is why some kitchenware are "top rack only".
The bubbles you see in boiling water isn't air, it's just water that has become hot enough to turn into steam.
All carbonation is just gas (usually C02) dissolved in liquid. It dissolves better in colder liquids, and under higher pressures. If you do anything to knock that gas out of suspension the gas will form bubbles and float out of the liquid. If you shake a drink the co2 forms bubbles and float out. In fact many wine makers use a degassing tool (think like the paint mixer you’d attach to a drill) to knock co2 bubbles out of wine between fermentation and bottling.
Approximately yes. If you look into it more precisely, there will be tiny variations due to 2 phenomena: * nucleon bonding energy: Following E=mc^2, if something loses energy it also loses mass. If sodium's nucleus is a bit more stable (i.e. lower energy) than carbon (the reference), then it will be a bit lighter than exactly 23. If it's more unstable, it will be heavier. * the natural isotope distribution: The most abundant sodium "version" might be the one with 23 amu, but there may be smaller amounts of 22- or 24 amu sodium (with extra or less neutrons). That also throws the exact number off since you have to take the weighted average then. In reality, sodium nuclei *are* a bit more stable than C nuclei (stability generally goes up from H to Fe, and from there onward it goes down again), and also sodium is a monoisotopic element, i.e. there's only 1 relevant isotope on Earth. So the second point is moot for sodium, and going by the first one the molar mass should  be a tiny bit below 23. It turns out to be **22.98976928(2)**.

It depends on the way they freeze!   If you make ice cubes in a tray in your fridge, the cold touches the outer water first. This will freeze first. As water gets colder, it can hold less gas - some of the air in the water will form bubbles. Freezing outside in, these bubbles get trapped in the ice, making it cloudy.   By comparison, an industrial ice cube maker usually uses cold 'fingers' around which water flows, meaning that the ice cubes freeze from the inside out - any air that would get trapped, gets carried away with the flow of water, leaving a nice and transparent cube of ice. This is where restaurant ice gets those holes in it, too.   Edit: I've done some more research and found out that while the above does hold true, the impurities, minerals and such, in water also play a big part. As ice freezes, it crystallises, and the crystal structures tend to push those impurities out. Freeze outside in, they get pushed towards and bunch up in the middle - freeze inside out, and they escape with the flowing water.
When you digest stuff, it gets broken down in yur intestine. But, the little molecules still have to be brought through the cells in your intestine to get into the blood. The molecules have to essentially fit through channels to do so. If the molecule doesn't fit, you can't absorb it. Some no calorie sweeteners might be close enough in shape to the real thing to taste sweet, but too different to be absorbed through those channels. Others are really good at activating your taste buds, so that tiny, tiny amounts taste as sweet as lots of real sugar. But there is so little in the food or drink, that it is basically the same as if you didn't eat any calories
your entire body works very hard to try to stay balanced, and the process is more complicated than simply throwing out the bad and keeping the good.   you can think of it as a puzzle where you want everything as even as possible,  but you arent allowed to have any empty slots.  if you want to throw out sodium you need to fill the spot the sodium is in with something else similar enough to fit there.  if you want more calcium you need to try to throw out something in a calcium shaped spot.   while drinking water after ingesting too much sodium helps with short term symptoms such as dehydration or cramps,  it usually does not supply the necessary pieces to fill in the sodium spots when sodium is thrown away. those still need to be taken from elsewhere.   so a large excess of sodium long term heavily taxes the body by causing a loss of other similar nutrients that cant be absorbed since there are no open spots for them, heavily taxes organs like the kidney that are trying to move sodium everyday when it doesnt have enough puzzle pieces to keep up with the consupmtion, and can eventually cause even further unbalances as other puzzle pieces have to be reshuffled to attempt to balance with the sodium.   p.s.  the reason water retains with sodium  is because your body is struggling to find pieces to trade out with the sodium and must keep it.  the water is kept as well to prevent those immediate issues of sodium like dehydration and cramps etc.  but doesnt fix the core issue.   ***tldr having a very high amount of sodium is like playing a game of tetris with a ton of one piece and hardly any of the others.  your body tries to adapt but eventually you end up with more and more pieces on the board that are sodium and no way to get rid of them.  while water can help short term with sodium consumption it doesnt give your body the needed pieces to clear a board full of sodium, and instead fills the board up even more as a piece that glues itself to sodium.***
White gold is mixed with white metals like nickel, while yellow gold is mixed with yellow metals like copper.
Fire needs three things. Heat, fuel and oxygen.  You dont have random fuel in air, and the heat diminishes quickly at a distance from the flame.  So while oxygen is plentiful in the atmosphere, the other two, thankfully, are not.
In covalent bonding, atoms share pairs of electrons. They are held together because they're both grabbing onto the same electrons. In ionic bonding, there's no sharing. One atom just straight up steals electrons from the other. That makes one atom negatively-charged and one atom positively-charged. And so they're held together by the electrostatic force that makes negative charge attracted to positive charge, as if the two ions were one giant proton and one giant electron. Molecular compounds are, esentially, self-contained compounds - ones where the individual molecules are discrete, and not physically connected to other molecules. This in contrast to a *macro*molecular/matrix compound, which is like one giant molecule with no clear boundary because everything is connected to everything else. For example, silica, which is what quartz is made of, has the formula SiO2 - but it's not like a quartz crystal is a bunch of individual SiO2 molecules just huddled together. Instead, it's a huge web of Si and O atoms, where every Si connects to 4 O, and each of those O connects to 2 Si, and each of *those* Si connects to 4 more O, and each of *those* O connect to 2 more Si, and on and on and on. So the formula isn't really expressing that there are discrete, individual SiO2 molecules - it's just saying that, taken all together, there are twice as many O atoms as Si. Molecular compounds are the opposite of that. O2, for instance, is molecular. Oxygen doesn't form huge rings where every oxygen atom is connected to two other oxygen atoms. You *do* in that case just have a bunch of individual O2 molecules. Ionic compounds are generally macromolecular.
When liquid water hits 100 C (212 F), it stops getting hotter. If you add more energy into the liquid water, that energy goes towards turning the liquid water into a gas rather than making the water hotter.     The chemical reactions involved in frying tend to happen at temperatures above 100 C.      For most oils the boiling temperatures is well above 100 C.   Though you rarely reach it. Most of the bubbling in oil is water that was mixed with the food boiling.
Radiation is normally Alpha, Beta and Gamma radiation, a positron is something different but is related to particle physics. Which are basically a Helium atom (without electrons), an Electron and an Electromagnetic wave (like light but more dangerous).
Better experience. When some things like bread are microwaved they go a bit chewy due to the heat, meanwhile when some things get baked in an oven they lose a lot of moisture and might become too crispy. Both methods work but which gives better results depends on the nature of what you are heating.
It’s not recorded anywhere since these first events happened in prehistory. What *probably* happened was someone threw some metal-rich ores into their campfire rocks, and then proceeded to make a pointlessly huge and hot bonfire as all manly dorks do. The way-too-hot fire melts the ore and the next morning they find purified copper in the ashes.
Cooking oil vaporizes out of open pans and settles back down on nearby surfaces mixing with dust that's already there.
Freezing a huge amount of water requires a huge amount of energy. That makes it incredibly expensive. Getting fresh water isn't a technical problem, it's an economic problem. Most areas threatened by loss of fresh water supplies don't have the money to build massive desalination plants.
Certain vitamins and other nutrients can certainly be reduced by the cooking process, but the amount lost depends on the cooking process, and healthy foods are still healthy because even after cooking, they still contain plenty of vitamins and other nutrients - enough that your body needs assuming that you eat a balanced diet. Some cooking processes can actually make it easier for your body too extract the nutrients. As for things like meat, yes, some nutrients can be lost in the cooking process, but again, it really varies based on the specific cooking process, and you're not losing all of the nutrients. Regardless, we cook meat anyway because it's generally not safe to eat raw.
I'm not sure I understand the question, but heating up and cooling down are basically the same thing. The hot water has high thermal energy, the cold water has low thermal energy. When you mix them they split the difference. The cold water is heating up and the warm water is cooling down until the energy is distributed evenly. For half the water to warm up faster than the other half cools down would violate the first law of thermodynamics.
Drugs cost millions, sometimes billions of dollars in research and development. Most times, drugs are under a patent when they come to market, meaning only the company that owns the patent can produce and sell it until the patent expires. This is why we have generic vs name brand drugs (genetics are made after the patent expires).  During the time when it's under patent, that cost is often passed down into the price of the drug. For example, I used to be on a medication that was under patent and had no generic. It would have been $9,000 / month without insurance. They lost their patent 2 years ago and I was able to get the generic for $150 / month (without insurance).
Water can evaporate, even when it's below boiling. What happens is that some molecules in the water are much faster than others, and these really fast molecules can actually manage to escape the water even if the average temperature is below boiling. This actually happens all the time something is wet, after all when you dry yourself with a towel and just leave the towel hanging for a few hours it will be dry afterwards.  The reason you're seeing vapour in this case is because the air was very cold, this means that it can't actually hold a lot of steam, meaning these water molecules that escaped your wet clothing immediately condense back to tiny liquid droplets in the air, and these tiny liquid droplets are what you see as vapour
Pure Potassium being reactive means that it wants to violently bond with some other element. That's what makes it dangerous, but the potassium in bananas is in a molecule meaning that it's already reacted with something. That's what makes it safe. This is the same reason that the chlorine in tablet salt doesn't kill you. Fun fact, the Potassium in bananas also makes them slightly radioactive but you should keep eating them anyway. You get 10 times more radiation from sitting in front of an old school monitor than you do from a banana. It's perfectly safe. Because bananas are measurably radioactive physicists often joke about a BED - Banana Equivilent Dose. IE how many bananas would you have to eat to get as much radiation as a chest X-ray?  10,000
It deppends, but most of the time, a catalyst acts as an intermediate component of the reaction.    Let's say we have a three reactions with elements A, B, and C that goes like this:  1) A + B -> AB 2) A + C -> AC 3) AC + B -> AB + C    Imagine that reaction (1) is really slow to happen on its own, but (2) and (3) are really fast, so is easy to see that if I mix A, B, and C, what will happen is: A + B + C -> AC + B -> AB + C So, C acted as a catalyst; it helped the reaction (1) happening faster, and it was not consumed.
*Lots* of chemicals are used - there is no universal list to give you. For example, here are strawberry-tasting materials: http://www.perflavory.com/flavor/strawberry.html The "how" basically comes down to doing an analysis of Some Thing to find out what it's made of, then researching and experimenting from there.
A sensor that looks for sulphur in the air could probably detect bad breath. Sulphur (S) is the bad smell in morning breath, onions, and flatulence. They have breath sensors out there that react to certain chemicals exhaled in the breath. Smell is not a property of food, for example, but is a sense. Anytime you smell something, small gaseous particles of it are actually going up into your nose and getting captures and interpreted by olfactory sensors in the nose. Just a guess, but a bad breath or halitosis sensor might look for the chemicals released by mouth bacteria that cause breath smells (which people happen to interpret as bad smelling).
Opiates fit into receptors in the brain like a key in a key hole. Nalaxone blocks the keyhole. It's more technical than that but that's the basic way to say it.
Sunscreen works by blocking and absorbing UV rays through a combination of physical and chemical particles. Physical particles, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, are used to reflect UV radiation from the skin.
The color of the flame depends mostly on two things: fuel source and temperature. Cellulose (wood products) is the source most people see most often. It burns at a relatively low temperature, so it is orange and yellow.      The higher the temperature, the lighter the color of the flame.      Throw other fuels in the flame and you can change the color to red, green, blue, etc.
Hydrogen atoms have just one electron, acidity is the concentration of H+, or, hydrogen atoms without their electron, a single core, a naked proton and neutron pair. This is something that is not anything the proton and neutron desire, they desire an electron, so they take one, with force. In that process the donor loses an electron and becomes an ion and becomes soluble.
Alchemy was the medieval forerunner of chemistry, based on the supposed transformation of matter. It was concerned particularly with attempts to convert base metals into gold or to find a universal elixir. Although some of it was pseudoscience, a lot of it is what ended up becoming chemistry.
The heat from the toaster causes the moisture in the bread to evaporate, making it dry and crunchy. The heat also caramelizes the sugars present in the bread, making it golden brown. This process, called the Maillard Reaction is also what gives grilled or broiled meats the dark color on the surface while the inside stays lighter.
Yes.   Pressure cookers work by putting the food under pressure.  This increases the boiling point of water, which allows more heat to be put into the food, thus cooking it faster.  Certain chemical reactions (which is what cooking is - chemical reactions that happen with heat) won't happen below a certain temperate (or at least happen much, much slower).  This can lead to different textures or flavors when you cook at a higher temperature. You can mitigate this by carefully managing cooking time, but they will still happen.  In most cases, though, the time savings from pressure cooking far outweigh the negative impacts.
All you really need is a small amount of fluoride to help harden enamel and the rest is just a mild abrasive to help brush away deposits. Everything else is marketing. There’s not much new technology in toothpaste so it’s all personal taste.  Just regular brushing and flossing is all you need to keep good dental hygiene.  Two things I think are worthwhile:  ultrasonic electric toothbrushes. These seem very effective compared to  regular hand brushing.  Tongue scraper - just a simple cheap plastic one used daily helps with cleaning off deposits on your tongue and helps freshen breath.
so that the ingredients are incorporated throughout - you dont want a piece of whatever you are baking to have all the baking powder, or salt, or sugar - they need to be incorporated to also assist in the chemical reaction that is the batter
They used to do lab tests and to determined how many calories are in it they would set it on fire and see how hot it burned.   Now a days they look up how much nutrition was in the ingredients (which were tested in a lab and averaged) and just add it up.
ELI5: the bubbles are hiding in the drink, and come out after everyone else is gone. The carbon dioxide is dissolved in the liquid. At higher pressure, liquids can hold more dissolved substances, so when you open the bottle/can and release the pressure, the dissolved carbon dioxide changes into a gas and forms bubbles
Carbon is good at adsorbing things. Meaning that stuff like toxins sticks to its surface really well. Charcoal is mostly made of carbon. That's why it's black. It's also very porous. That's why it's light and easy to crush. So it has a LOT of surface area - ten tablets of activated charcoal have a combined surface area the size of a football field. And the more surface area there is, the more stuff can be adsorbed. &#x200B; Note that charcoal is only *mostly* made of carbon. And there's a big difference between "mostly carbon" and "all carbon": ordinary charcoal, the sort that you get by burning wood, also has tars and all sorts of other gunk in it. The problem here is that normal charcoal's surface and *especially* its pores are almost completely clogged with said gunk. So most of charcoal's surface is useless: it can't be used to adsorb stuff. &#x200B; Normal charcoal adsorbs well (for example, it's good enough to purify moonshine before a final distillation), but it could adsorb a lot better IF you removed all the tar. The process of removing tar is called "activating" charcoal. The end result is that you have not just carbon, but *pure* carbon: all of its pores are free of gunk and all of its surface can be used to adsorb stuff. &#x200B; \-------- &#x200B; UPD: Got a few frequently asked questions ITT, so I'll answer them here. &#x200B; a) Adsorb is a real word. It's the same thing as "absorb", except stuff sticks to the surface of the *ad*sorbent instead of dissolving in the *ab*sorbent's volume. There is no real practical difference unless you're a chemist. But it's important to me to use chemical terms in a precise manner. That includes using the right word even when a wrong word would suffice. &#x200B; b) Toxins are harmful substances produced inside living organisms. Botulinum and penicillin are toxins, mercury chloride is not, methylmercury might or might not be a toxin (because you can make it in a lab, but living things can also make it). Whether a substance is harmful or not is subjective; there is no single chemical property that makes something toxic. Humans don't notice the harmful properties of capsaicin, whereas bugs find it to be a very deadly neurotoxin indeed. Yes, I know that word is used by corporations and indivivuals alike to sell useless stuff to people who don't know better. No, I won't stop using the word "toxin". It's a good word, and it means *exactly* what I think it means. I don't care who else uses it and for what purposes. &#x200B; c) A category I called "stuff like toxins" is better phrased as "everything, including poisonous substances, drugs and vitamins". Charcoal don't care, it just takes what it wants. &#x200B; d) It's called "activated" and not "clean" charcoal because "clean" would require a separate ELI5 to explain why it's better at its job to *every single customer* (except for a small portion of chemists). In days before the Internet, that would mean terribly high added costs. Whereas anyone can sort of understand why "activated" is better at scrubbing bad stuff from your gut. &#x200B; UPD2: Another frequently asked question, "how is it activated", I have already answered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/qgsty8/eli5_what_does_it_mean_when_charcoal_is_activated/hi968lo/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). That's far from an exhaustive description, but there are [good videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNKeps6pIao) on Youtube describing and demonstrating the process as well. In retrospect, I probably should have just linked that video from the start. It explains things brilliantly, shows how the process works, and demonstrates the difference between ordinary charcoal and activated charcoal with an iodine number test. &#x200B; UPD3: It appears that there's some large-scale kookery going on that I'm not aware of. And people are upset enough about it to ignore points b) and c) in this post in order to yell at me about stuff that I already know and have clearly stated, oh, maybe ten times already. So let me rephrase those points a bit more forcefully. &#x200B; e) Whatever snake oil salesmen or "health gurus" are telling you about activated carbon's miracle properties, it DOES NOT AND CANNOT HAVE MIRACLE PROPERTIES. All it can do is bind toxins that are in your gut right now. Like when you ate something moldy - then activated carbon can bind the toxic stuff that's in the mold. But it does so while binding *everything else* that isn't water, a short-chain alcohol or an inorganic salt. "Everything else" includes nutrients, vitamins and medicine. So using it as a food supplement is a *bad idea*. Chances are, you don't have enough vitamins in your diet as it is; don't waste the small amount that you already get by drinking sorbents when you don't have a dire need to. &#x200B; In other words: when you drink activated carbon, you poop most of the toxic stuff in your stomach out without getting it in your bloodstream. But you'll poop most of the useful stuff out as well. &#x200B; The only reason I said "stuff like toxins" is because that's what doctors in Russia are using it to adsorb: toxins in the food. Not, say, inorganic salts of heavy metals, that's what it doesn't adsorb very well; there are other things that bind them better. Also, they use activated charcoal once in a blue moon, specifically when you eat something bad or drink too many tablets of some other drug. They don't use it all the time, because like any normal person with a moderately good grasp of chemistry they KNOW it binds everything. &#x200B; Now that I made my position clear, please stop arguing with me about activated charcoal not having miracle properties. I *already know* that it doesn't.
The blood-brain barrier is an extra layer of protection between everything in your circulation and your brain, because your body really needs to keep your brain protected for you to live. The barrier tries to keep dangerous things out, and that includes a lot of molecules, including medications. A medication that doesn’t cross the BBB usually has little or no effect on your brain because it can’t reach your brain. It can still “hit hard” if its effect isn’t on brain cells and receptors. That’s one of the big differences between older antihistamines like Benadryl and newer ones like Claritin. Benadryl affects histamine receptors in your brain and makes you sleepy or confused. Claritin doesn’t cross as easily, so it doesn’t have that effect.
It’s a natural edible acid in the same sense as lemon juice is an edible acid and comes dissolved in water and other juices which add to the flavour and make it valuable for cooking. Unlike lemon juice vinegar is produced by bacteria through fermentation. Like lemon juice it’s acidic properties make it useful as a household cleaner as well. Because it’s an inhospitable environment for most microbes it can also serve as a preservative, but it will change the taste as it seeps into the food it’s preserving. Hence: pickles
Sugars in general are quite stable against surrounding conditions and will not, or only after a very long time (talking about years or decades) break down, if the bottle is closed. If the bottle is opened, eventually germs and fungi will invade and break down the sugar and everything else. So to answer your question: No it will not happen on its own. For sugar free beverages the industry just does not add sugar but instead adds other sweeteners. If you want to remove to sugar from some bought product (for whatever reason you'd do this), I can only think of one major pathway: Enzymes. With the correct enzymes, the sugar will get broken down to smaller molecules which will neither have a sweetening effect nor have the high amount of energy, sugar holds. Nevertheless, afterwards you'd have to remove the enzymes again through coagulation and filtration. Important to mention: Enzymes work only at specific conditions (temperature, pH) so it'd take quite some trial and error to find the right (hopefully commercially available) enzyme for the product you want to desugarize.
How do you know it isn't as placebo? Have you had someone do a double blind test on you?
There isn't, though I usually hear "harsh chemicals" used referring to skin irritants. Assuming your gear is glass, rubbing alcohol and salt will be just fine. Rinse with water when done.
Coffee is a stimulant that gets all systems in your body moving \- Digestive sytem: have a seat   \- Nervous system: have the shakes   \- Mood chemicals (Dopamine) in the brain:  have a smile
The salonpas I'm aware of use topical Lidocaine which is a numbing agent/local anesthetic. All it does is block the pain signals at the nerve ends and does nothing to mitigate the cause of the pain.
Stability is relative. Nature tends towards the lowest energy state, O2 has a lower energy than lone oxygen atoms floating around. So if you have gaseous oxygen it is stable as O2. However it isn’t in its lowest energy state, if there is some copper in the system then the oxygen can react with it and release energy. The copper oxide had a lower energy than the lone copper and oxygen and so is a more stable state.
All water has some dissolved gas in it. I'm fairly sure that as water freezes (and expands due to the way the water molecules arrange in a crystal) the gas is pushed out of solution and forms the bubbles.
Yes, actually; but the reasons are merely historical now. As you might know, there are several *quantum numbers* that identify where an electron "is," or what shell it fits into. One of those numbers is the *angular momentum number* ℓ, and it's this number we're interested in. In the early days of spectroscopy, scientists noted that some series of spectral lines of alkali metals -- those corresponding to ℓ-values of zero through three -- appeared to be **s**harp, **p**rincipal in nature, **d**iffuse in nature, and **f**undamentally related to hydrogen lines, in order.
It doesn't exist. Simple as that. There is no such thing as a "truth serum." There are chemicals that can lower your inhibitions and make you more susceptible  to saying things you wouldn't otherwise say (think alcohol) but there are simply no substances that exist that can cause consistent or predictable enhancement of truth-telling.
Because the way the restaurant makes it and the way the bottling company makes it are totally different. The bottling company's process is optimized for large-scale batch production: thousands or tens of thousands of liters at a time. If the restaurant is brewing it in house, they're maybe making ten to fifty liters at a time. The processes will be completely different, and the product will be different as a result.
hand sanitizer is mostly alcohol so it is flammable, like vodka is. an electric spark will light flammable things.
Big tobacco literally paid to have scenes like that put in movies to make smoking seem cool and sell more. "Thank you for smoking" is a good movie that covers alot of shit like this.
>Does the humidity in the air gather around the bottle? Yes. The bottle is much cooler than its surroundings, so as the air passes over it, it drops to its dew point, causing water to precipitate onto the surface.
Stress concentration. Let's imagine a sheet of paper, gripped evenly on both ends and pulled apart. Not hard enough to tear, yet, but it's in tension. Held in front of you, pulling left and right. Let's look at the middle of this paper, a line running up the center - this line should be right between your hands as you stretch the paper sideways. At any point on this line, the paper is experiencing maybe 1 pound per inch. That's not enough to tear it, but it's a lot. Now we introduce a small snip at the edge of the paper - cutting the end of the line. It still hasn't torn. Imagine what the paper at that snip is doing - it's pulling apart now, so obviously it is no longer bearing that 1 pound per inch. Instead, the stress it would be experiencing is passed on to the paper right where the cut ended. The stretchier our material, the more spread out this stress is. Paper's not very stretchy, so you get a lot of stress concentrated right where your cut stopped. Way more than the original one pound per inch. At this point, the paper probably starts to tear where the stress is greatest. As the tear grows, this point of high stress is pushed along with it.
Everything you stick the tape to is dirty. That dirt bonds to the tape adhesive, leaving less exposed adhesive to adhere to the next thing. The top of the tape is clean when it's rolled so there's not schmoo on the adhesive.
When manufacturing glass facilities put iron oxide in the glass to assist with production. When you look through glass normally, the thickness is so thin the tint is almost impossible to see. When you look at glass from the side, the thickness of glass is an order of magnitude thicker and therefore the tint is much more noticeable.
Drugs with longer half lives so gradually build up. Often, when someone starts a long term prescription, it takes a while to get to what’s called a therapeutic level, which is basically what your question describes. You might take 50mg once a day, but your liver only lets 5mg into your bloodstream, and after 24 hrs only 2.5 are left, but you need 35 mg circulating for the medication to work, so you don’t notice much of an effect for the first 2 weeks you’re taking it.
They are not causing physical damage. They are chemically interfering with biological processes. Things like neuron transmissions only use very small amounts of certain chemicals for signaling. There are a massive number of them, but atoms and molecules are extremely small. It takes HUGE numbers to create masses large enough for us to see and interact with. To explain what I'm about to do, there is a concept called the mole. It is based on Avagadro's Number, which is 6.022 x 10 \^ 23. Or 602,200,000,000,000,000,000,000. A "mole" of a substance is an amount consisting of that number of particles, be it atoms or molecules. So a mole of iron is a piece of iron that has 6.022 x 10 \^ 23 iron atoms. A mole of water is a drop with 6.022 x 10 \^ 23 water molecules. Fentanyl has a molar weight of 336.471 grams / mole. That is roughly 0.003 moles per gram. So a gram of fentanyl has approximately 1, 806 QUINTILLION fentanyl molecules.  Not specifically fentanyl, but say there is a chemical that binds to neuron receptors and blocks signalling. It has the same molar weight as fentanyl and you get just 1 milligram into your system. That is still enough to block 1.8 QUINTILLION receptor sites in your body. This assumes that every molecule reaches a receptor site and binds with it, which is never going to happen. Just giving numbers to demonstrate the concept.
Cotton candy is "spun sugar". The basic idea is to melt sugar to the point that it will flow though a small nozzle and then solidify in the form of thin, flexible threads. To do this a cotton candy machine spins a heated cup that has tiny holes along the outer edge, connected to the bottom of the cup. As the sugar melts it can flow through the holes and is thrown through open air that cools it, collecting on the outer rim of a surrounding tub.
Soap doesn't really need to bubble or be foamy. Companies add it to make if feel like its cleaning better. Bubbles have nothing to do with cleaning.  The common ingredients that make soap foam are sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), sodium lauryl sulfate (sometimes referred to as sodium dodecyl sulfate or SLS) and coco-glucoside.
That's for the 2nd shell, atoms can have more shells than that. Each shell is limited to 2n^2 electrons, where *n* is the number of the shell. So a 3rd shell can support up to 18, etc. The reason *why* there is a maximum is all quantum mechanic stuff. Basically there's four numbers in quantum numbers that can completely describe a particular electron in a shell completely, and if you exceed that specific number in a shell then you end up having 2 electrons with the same 4 numbers, which is impossible.
Yes. All temperature is _average_ thermal energy. In that 8oz cup of 40F water there are a few water molecules that are 41, 42 and so on and there are some that are cooler. But on average its 40F.  When you combine the two 8oz glasses, you now 16 oz at an average temperature of 60F.  If the hot water were to "take over" and cause the average of the combined 16 oz to warm closer to 80F that would be a violation of thermodynamic law - where did the extra heat come from? If no heat entered the system them the total overall heat has to remain the same.
The technical term for this is contrails. As a plane flies at high altitude water droplets that come out of the engines mix with particulates from exhaust gases and freeze as they come into contact with the air forming crystals. The contrail is basically an artificial cloud, so it stays up there until it dissipates. If you search for this online you'll no doubt find what conspiracy theorists refer to as *chemtrails* believing this ridiculous idea that planes are dumping chemicals into the air to poison you, keep the populous under control or whatever. It's total nonsense.
Because it basically ferments/rots in some way. Or it’s just weird chemistry that only happens when exposed to open air for long periods.
The short answer is that we don't really know. One popular working theory is that depression is caused by inbalances of substances in the brain (neurotransmitters like dopamine etc.), and that antidepressents help fix this inbalance. There is lots of evidence to suggest this isn't what occurs however - we haven't ditched the theory because every other way we have of explaining what occurs is even less useful. There's definitely a nobel prize in it for whoever finally manages to crack this one! Despite not really knowing how they work, we still use them because for a lot of people they are effective - we're just not sure why it helps for some people but not others.
Alcohol and water mix. That is, the alcohol actually dissolves in the water and forms bonds with it. This solution has a much lower freezing point than just pure water, it's actually a new homogenous solution.
Ok, so it helps to think of chemicals in terms of an analogy with real objects.  Imagine your chemicals as balls tied together with rope. **But**, in between the two balls, there’s a compressed spring pushing them apart. The spring can’t separate them because they’re tied together, but it’s trying its best to shove them.  Imagine an exothermic reaction as cutting that string. Now that the balls aren’t tied together anymore, the spring shoves the balls apart super hard, making them shoot off in opposite directions. Now you have two balls moving around and bouncing off of things.  You may have heard that heat is just the movement of small particles. Well, in our analogy, since the balls are small particles, and now they’re moving around, we just released heat.  _____ I saw you asking how potential energy is converted into motion in another comment chain. It’s very much analogous to the spring.  When the balls are bonded together (attached with a string), there’s a bunch of potential energy stored in the spring that can’t escape.  Once you input the activation energy for the reaction (cutting the string), you break the bond, and all the potential energy shoves the particles apart, giving them kinetic energy. ____ **Edit:** *ATP is different though. In that process, we’re actually trying to release as little heat as possible, since heat just escapes into the environment, and the energy that went into it is lost to us.* *Essentially, with ATP, we’re using the decompression from our spring (cellular respiration reaction) to shoot the ball right into another spring. That spring gets compressed from the ball shooting into it, and then we drop a latch across the two balls, forcing them to stay together, just like with the knot tying our balls together earlier.* *The important thing here though, is that since we used a latch to hold the balls together, instead of tying a knot, it’s a lot easier to release the balls again when we’re ready. That’s essentially what ATP is doing. It’s making a compressed spring system that’s super easy for us to unlatch when we need the energy.*
Firefighter here. Fire needs 3 things to exist. Fuel, oxygen, and heat. I’d you remove 1, the fire can no longer exist.  Take a candle. Put the lid on it. The oxygen runs out, and the fire goes out. Wild land firefighting is about fuel management. Remove new things for the fire to burn and it will burn itself out.  Now for your average structure fire. It’s too big to remove the oxygen from. It’s too large to dismantle the house and thus remove the fuel. So we have to remove the heat.  Water is really good at removing heat. It’s also really cheap and easy to get.  Fires don’t actually burn objects the way you think they do. Every item has an ignition point. This point is the temperature at which the item begin to puts off flammable gasses. These gasses are what are actually burning. These gasses are hot, the same temperature as the objects ignition point. When you start a fire, it takes a minute to ignite whatever it is you’re trying to burn. The flame from your ignition source is heating up and drying out whatever your fuel is. Once the fuel is hot enough, the gasses it puts off ignites. This spreads over the object, more heat, more drying, more gasses releasing, more ignition.  This is what smoke is. It’s actually unburned fuel. If you get smoke hot enough, it can ignite and burn. Water is introduced to a fire. It is colder than the hot burning gases and this pulls heat away from the fire, turning to steam in the process. That continues, until the super hot burning gasses are cooled to the point that they are below their ignition temperature. Not enough heat, fire goes out. Water is easy to get. It’s practically limitless. It’s used for a lot of other stuff within cities too. So it’s easy to throw an extra pipe down into the city’s water system, put a cap on it, and bam, fire hydrant. Further, it doesn’t cause environmental issues when you’re using it in the abundance we use it to fight fires.  Sure, there are substances out there that are more effective than water at removing heat, but they’re expensive and impractical to use most of the time. They also may require special equipment. Water can be sprayed through hoses and nozzles easily. Firefighting foam is fantastic at putting fires out but they aren’t as easy to use and you can’t use it in the volume you need on most fires.  Some fuels require special foams or powders to put out because water won’t work. Water may mix with the chemical on fire and cause a reaction. That is why there are different types of extinguishers.  TLDR: water is good at removing heat and is plentiful and cheap enough to be used universally to put out fires by removing the heat. Edit: there are tons of comments about the fire tetrahedron. Yes, that is the current model for fire behavior. It’s a bit outside of the ELI5 level so I chose to keep it simple. The fire triangle is easy to understand, explain, and show. It’s hard to explain and show a chemical chain reaction.
It’s because you broke the deal on the container. Get two jugs of milk with one holding a gallon and the other a quart and they will be pretty much the same as long as you don’t open them. The reason opening it makes it spoil faster is that bacteria in the air can get into it. Milk is pasteurized in the production of it to remove microbes and make it last longer on the shelf.
The one color is at the base where the outlet is and gets mixed in right as it leaves the cap. If you cut open the tube it would look like one colour at the top and another colour at the bottom. [Here you go](https://i.imgur.com/fDYPfid.png)
Primarily because distillation increases the concentration of all the alcohol in the final product. All fermentation produces a mixture of methanol (the bad alcohol) and ethanol (the good alcohol). Generally the concentration of methanol is rather small in the primary fermentation product and it is therefore not dangerous (wine and beer)  Methanol boils at a lower temperature than ethanol. Therefore when distilling, the initial distillate contains a very high (and poisonous) concentration of methanol. The distiller has to discard the initial distillate to get rid of (most of) the methanol.
sodium sulucoaluminate is an anti caking agent. It keeps the salt from clumping together. Iodized salt is often used because humans need iodine, and if a population lives far from the sea, that is an easy way to ensure everyone gets it. Dextrose apparently stabilizes the iodine.
They dissolved it into tea, it did slightly poison everyone else, and it hurt him most because he’s the only one that drank the tea. The polonium can’t poison you too badly from outside the skin, because the particles are too heavy to get inside. But once inside they tear everything apart. Basically the dust got everywhere, as dust does, and that’s how the authorities traced the poisoning.
Working for a large scale food manufacturer in the quality assurance department, I can assure you that the values on the NFPs are pretty accurate. However, they do allow about a 20% variance from the true value. There are multiple different tests that can be conducted to extract and quantify fats, proteins, carb, vitamins and minerals. These values are usually remain constant in each ingredient and are compiled in to a database so that they can be easily referenced when creating nutritionals for new products. The fats, proteins, and carbs are the only things which contribute caloric value to a food - 9, 4, and 4 calories per gram respectively - and are combined to create total calories in a product. Edit: More explanation
The sun evaporates *water* from the ocean; the salt is left behind. This is one way water is *desalinated* -- boil it or evaporate it away, then collect the resulting water. Bonus: you can also collect the left-behind salt.
Well the salt is breaking down into smaller molecules which are smaller than the pores in the filter and therefore can pass through.  If your got a filter with pores smaller than a molecule of salt, the solution would not pass through the filter.
The key difference between those 3 is the amount of fat they contain - butter is mostly milkfat (around 80%+), while cream ranges from around 30-50% depending on type, and milk is way down around 3.5% (or less if not using whole milk).  This affects the final texture of the ganache - how thick and solid, or how loose and liquidy it ends up. Traditional ganache is just a 50/50 mixture of chocolate and cream - it's got a nice silky texture and a lot of richness from the fat in the cream.  Some people prefer less fat content, so they'll mix cream and milk together to get a final result that's still somewhat silky, but a little looser and a little less rich - or they may go with milk only, but that usually requires using less milk or using other tricks to make sure it doesn't end up too runny, because milk has a higher liquid content than cream, since it has so much less fat. In a pinch, butter and milk can be a substitute for cream, if you run out or if heavy cream isn't available.  A little bit of melted butter mixed with milk will add some fat and richness and work as a substitute for heavy cream, to get that texture and glossy finish.  It's just all about balancing out how much fat is going into the end product.
The chemical reactions in your body are set and unchanging. It is impossible to introduce new chemical pathways. All pharmacology is either enhancing or suppressing one of these pathways. Drug side effects occur when the drug is chemically similar enough to interact with something in a different pathway other the one it is intended to work on. all the chemical pathways are interconnected as well so slowing one down or speeding one up is likely to have a “domino” effect which causes other effects to occur. Furthermore the same chemicals can serve multiple roles depending on the tissue they are present in, taking an analogue of that chemical systemically may cause multiple different effects in different tissues.

Steroids are molecules that have 17 carbon atoms arranged into four rings.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid However by that definition cholesterol is also a steroid (aka sterol-like).  Steroid hormones are substances that activate certain nuclear receptors, like the sex hormones testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone which activate their respective receptors, and the corticosteroids which include mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. If you have medicines which suppresses the immune system, those are glucocorticoids. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid The steroids that make muscles grow bigger (anabolic-androgenic steroids) activate the testosterone receptor.
It's not difficult. It only requires either lots of time and area (natural evaporation) or enormous amounts of energy (distillation) for comparatively low yields.
Well our body uses many many more enzymes to process other stuff, but you simply don't hear about them a lot. Our metabolism is basically burning anything we eat, and a whole arsenal of enzymes allows that at temperatures that don't kill us (by being catalysts for the reactions) B12 is actually transformed into 2 enzymes, Adenosylcobalamine and Methylcobalamine. It's purpose isn't, "being processed in large quantities for energy" but it's rather part of the processing side.
Glass is made of two things silicon and oxygen. to dissolve it you need to be able to separate these two things apart. Think of these as a husband and wife.  Their bond is quite strong as its quite a stable relationship. Then comes the homewrecker called acid bringing their attractive ions along. Other couples are attracted to these ions more than their husband/wife therefore they dissolve. The bond in glass is too strong more most acids to break. Except hydroflouric acid. They're the kneau reeves of the acid world. HOT. Edit: after a long hard think... Im leaving the typos in. Edit2: thanks for all the awards! Was not expecting that!
When food is reheated that draws moisture out of it.  This is why for very greasy or wet food it's not usually a big deal, and some can even end up being soggier than originally as that water gets moved around and some more was probably picked up as condensation inside the fridge.
They don't. Only thing that happens is a chemical reaction, there is nothing added to the battery when charging it, charging is just rearranging the electrons inside the battery.
It was always explained to me is that hot water will raise the outer layers of the meat to unacceptable, unsafe temperatures for unsafe periods of time, while the inner parts of the meat remain frozen. Whereas cold water will defrost the meat but not quickly put the meat into temperature ranges where you've got rampant bacterial growth, etc. When you water soak meat to help thaw it, you're not trying to cook the meat.  Hot water is completely unnecessary.  Cold water is cold but it's not THAT cold.  Else it would be ice.  Ever come in from a bitter cold day and put your hand under cold water, but it feels like hot water because compared to your hand it's warmer?  It's that. I'm not a food scientist; that's just how my grandmother taught me.
Secret recipes are really a rarity, unless theres an ingredient that is not and can not be reproduced by any other entity on the planet, everything can be reverse engineered and figured out. But with that you run into things like: Why are you putting so much effort into reverse-engineering a food? And You’ll receive a cease and desist letter PDQ if you’re infringing on someones registered intellectual property.
Basically there are receptors that the drug binds to like a puzzle piece. Narcan also fits that puzzle piece, so it attaches to the receptors instead of the drug.
The key to recognize is that we don’t produce electricity the way we do in our power plants…you don’t have conductive wires in your body carrying electrons around.  Your body used ions…charged atoms. Lots of common materials, e.g. salt, split into a positive and negative ions when they dissolve in water. Special biological structures called ion pumps can selectively push one kind of ion through a membrane and leave the other behind.  Now you’ve got a concentration of positively charged ions on one side of a barrier and negatively charged one on the other side…we have an electrical potential (a voltage difference). They want to recombine. If we let the ions come back together the voltage difference goes away and we have an electrical pulse, then the ion pumps can restore the potential. It’s creating and releasing these ion potentials that humans (and most other critters) use for electrical signaling.
RI at the end of both of them means “reuptake inhibitor”  When two nerve endings send a message to one another, they release Serotonin = S and Norepinephrine = N which is picked up by little finger-doodles on the receiving nerve ending. But this doesn’t happen instantly, they should stay in the gap between the nerves long enough for the “message” to be received and passed on. Then after the message is gone, both the S and the N are reabsorbed (reuptake) back into the surrounding two nerves.  Sometimes in people with disorders like depression there isn’t enough Serotonin or norepinephrine in that space between nerves for the messages to be adequately passed. and thus the message isn’t very well passed or received.  SSRI’s slow down the reabsorption specifically for serotonin, while SNRI’s slow down the reabsorption for both S and N. Allowing more serotonin or norepinephrine to build up between the nerves, allowing adequate time for the message to pass :) The uses of each vary based on whether it’s not enough Serotonin, not enough norepinephrine, or not enough of both :) hope this helped! Source- I work for a psychiatrist, and this is how he Eli-5’d it for me a few years ago. . Please don’t take me comment as medical law and leave the real answers to the real doctors :)
>Why does waterproof outdoor paint (fences, decking etc) need time to dry?      Because unless the solvent has fully evaporated it's still going to be partially liquid, meaning it can be easily smudged, removed or even washed away.
There are other substances that evaporate with water making it difficult to separate.  The wasting part comes through wasting clean drinking water. It's difficult, expensive, and not energy efficient to clean water for drinking. Once it's mixed with other chemicals, or into the sewage system, it's no longer considered drinkable water. Can't use it for crops, animals, etc.
I would imagine a solid stick would not be a very effective way. There are many water filters that rely on charcoal to filter out small particles, but usually the water is being passed though many small grains of charcoal to maximize surface area and ensure all the water comes in close contact. Charcoal works by being extremely porous and craggy.  Small particles in the water that come into contact with the surface of Charcol get stuck and are therefor removed from the water. So you want every single drop of water to pass across or through as much of the surface as possible. . So yes, Charcoal can be an effective way to filter many particles from water, but stirring with a solid charcoal stick is probably the least effective way to do it. Probably more effective to grind the stick up, place the grounds in a coffee filter or cheese cloth, and slowly pour the water through it.
Metallic hydrogen (a superconductor) would allow rockets to carry less fuel and increase payload. It basically provides equivalent amounts of energy with less volume.
Okay so, our brains work by sending messages via neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters activate receptors to get the message across (like a letter in a mailbox). We have receptors for all different kinds of neurotransmitters that our bodies make. Drugs act at some of these same receptors. These messages via neurotransmitter and receptor are important to keep our body functioning. And our body likes normal functioning. When you take drugs, you activate these receptors in a way that is exaggerated - the receptors really get over-activated. But our bodies don’t really like this because it isn’t normal functioning. So our body is like “wow okay I guess maybe we need to make some changes to get back to normal.” Usually it can achieve this just by elimination of the drug. However, repeated use of a drug makes our brains go “okay WOW guess elimination isn’t doing the trick really” so it decides to get rid of some of the receptors in an effort to regain normal functioning (homeostasis). Think of it like - you have 5 different mailboxes and usually you get 1 letter in each mailbox every day, on average, so you think 5 is a great amount. All of sudden, you start getting 50 letters in each mailbox every day and you can barely get anything else done bc there’s so much mail! Naturally, the first thing you’ll want to do is get rid of all of these mailboxes! Like, you no longer need 5, it’s just too much for you to handle. So your body is like “okay cool just gonna get rid of some of these receptors bc clearly we need fewer of them to maintain normal functioning.” When you abruptly stop taking the drug, now you only have a few receptors and normal functioning is again hard for your body. (Like, okay now you get way less mail because you have 1 mailbox. Great! Except now that there isn’t this huge influx of mail that forced you to remove your other 4 mailboxes, you realize you’re missing out on 4 letters per day that you were getting before and oh! It turns out those were actually pretty important.) It takes some time for your body to again adjust itself to normal functioning. While it’s adjusting, you’re brain has too few of these receptors for normal functioning, and it causes you to go through withdrawal.  TL;DR Your brain makes changes to account for the high level of activation at certain receptors caused by drug use. When the drug is no longer on board, those brain changes cause you to experience withdrawal symptoms. Eventually, your brain will make more changes to get back to normal and the withdrawal symptoms will fade. (Some details are different for different drugs - alcohol and nicotine in particular are kinda weird. But in general, this is what happens).
As there is [no medical evidence](https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/womens-health/myth-busting-no-more-8-glasses-a-day) saying 8 glasses a day is beneficial, it doesn’t really matter.  The idea behind the “common knowledge” statement is simply to be sure you’re drinking enough water. Since caffeine is a diuretic, you will need more water to balance that out. The only way to actually know if you’re getting enough water is to listen to your body.  The easiest indicator is your pee. It should be pretty clear to a pale yellow, and you should have a lot of it. You should also be going 6-8 times a day.  Other signs of dehydration are things like feeling tired, headaches, dizziness, dry lips and skin, and a few more.  There are frequently shifting factors that go into how much water you need each day. You can set a goal, but especially when drinking caffeine, it’s better to just pay attention to the signs.
I assume you mean a can?  Basically when a liquid cools down it begins to expand. A can of pop only hold a certain amount of contents so as it expands it slowly puts strain on the can until it eventually ruptures.
Rice and pasta can contain bacteria whose spores survive the cooking process. If boiled rice or pasta are left out at 12-14° C for a long time (more than 4-6 hours), it can become extremely dangerous to eat. At this temperature the spore producing bacteria can form heat resistant toxins.
Gemstones are finished cakes made up of a bunch of ingredient. Flour, milk, sugar.   Gold is an ingredient like flour.  It's easier to combine things together to make a new thing then to try to produce an element. :) Edit:  Thanks for the love y'all <3!  And to the rest you're taking this very seriously which I appreciate but I recognize this is not perfect! I did say gemstones instead of just diamonds but it's good to clarify!  This example is meant to be taken in good faith, with a hyperbolic examples to simplify for the forum. Both short and long answers are good though and you should all continue to keep learning !!  Thanks Reddit for making this my most popular topic and my first post that got rewards XD!!
Why do you know that urine is salty?
Air has gassy water vapor in it that is ready to condense back into liquid water when the air can't carry it any more. *Well*, it turns out that *cold* air can't carry as much water as *warm* air. So, when you've got a colder beverage and it starts sucking heat energy out of the air, it is also "coldening" the air to the point where it starts to deposit its water vapor, too.
Cooking is not just about safety, it's also matter of taste and texture changes - killing everything harmful can be achieved at mere 75 C, or even lower but at longer time. Only bacterial spores survive that, but they don't matter for food eaten immediately, they won't have time to wake up and multiply. But at 75 degrees meat hasn't even reached boiling point of water and various other chemical reactions occur at even higher temperatures - to sear/brown the meat or caramelize sugars you need 140.
People here are saying that it's because it evaporates quickly, but that's not why it's flammable, that's why it is easy to make it burn, which is kinda different.    Let's look at another very flammable material : magnesium. Magnesium burns at aroung 3000°C, if i remember correctly. It's absurdely bright and hot. But it's not easy to make it burn, you need to heat it with an open flame for ten seconds, maybe more, before it starts burning, because it's not volatile at all. If you could make very fine magnesium powder and threw that in the air, then tried to ignite it, it would probably ignite very easily, and be extremely dangerous, don't do that.    What makes rubbing alcohol flammable is the reaction it has with oxygen.    To explain that, I will NOT use rubbing alcohol, which is isopropyl alcohol, but a simpler alcohol : ethanol.    When you burn ethanol, you make it react with a specific "version" of oxygen. That "version" is just like regular O2, but it's EXTREMELY reactive. That "version" of oxygen is randomly create everywhere O2 exists, but the more you heat something, the more of this reactive oxygen is created. There is more reactive oxygen in heated air than in cold air.    Now let's look at the chemical reaction : C2H6O + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 3H2O    That means that, when you burn ethanol with oxygen, you create carbon dioxyde and water. And that creates heat. It creates heat because CO2 and H2O are more stable than ethanol and that reactive oxygen, but it's a bit complicated, so all you have to know is that it creates a lot of heat.    But as I said earlier, heat creates that reactive oxygen, and that reactive oxygen reacts with ethanol to burn it, which creates heat, etc...    So, basically, ethanol is flammable because when you create heat near it, it will react with oxygen in a way that creates enough heat to create more reactive oxygen and keep the reaction going.    Also there is a reason to the fact that it can't heat up infinitely and will stabilize at some temperature after a few seconds of burning, but that's also complicated.    And last thing, you can use things that are not oxygen to burn things, but again, it's complicated.
It's hard to imagine any flame as "the original one". Fire is one the products of a continuous chemical reaction, so the flame is constantly a new one, even on the same candle.
Water vapor is perfectly content to exist below boiling. Boiling temperature is special because, while at lower temperatures, the water occupies some of the air, at and above boiling it wants to occupy more than all of the air. Since it can never occupy more than all of the air above it, it keeps becoming a gas until it either runs out of heat or it runs out of water. For more detailed explanations, search the sub, as this is one of the most commonly asked questions.
So the thing about radiation, outside of the most extremely high concentrations it isn't going do much of anything immediately where you can really easily see cause and effect. Those super high concentrations don't exist naturally, they have to be refined into that. Even in modern times after something like the chernobyl disaster only 31 people directly died from it, the rest of the effects are long term increases in things like cancer rates which we can really only figure out because of statistics and having a huge sample size.
Nothing, this is called a "hydrogen fuel cell". Some problems are that hydrogen is a gas at standard temperature and pressure which introduces some storage challenges. It would require very high pressure, very low temperature, or some sort of stabilizing substrate to hold a significant amount in a tank. While you can just pour gasoline into a tank or can, transferring hydrogen is a bit more difficult. Rupturing a hydrogen fuel tank can also far more easily result in a violent explosion than a gasoline fuel tank, which just tends to burn vigorously. You also need to actually get the electricity to produce the hydrogen, and that often takes fossil fuels.
Like other constants that have dimensions, the gas constant is fundamentally a statement about how large the units we're using are, relative to one another. In this case, it's the product of two other constants: * Avogadro's constant, which defines the number of particles in a mole. If a mole were more (or fewer) molecules, then this constant would take on a different value, and so would the ideal gas constant. * The Boltzmann constant, which describes the relationship between temperature and energy. Specifically, the Boltzmann constant describes how much the energy of *each individual particle* in gas increases (on average) for each 1 degree Kelvin increase in temperature. If we used different energy or temperature units, this constant would take on a different value, and so would the ideal gas constant. Since we're multiplying the change in energy per particle (Boltzmann constant) by the number of particles per mole (Avogadro's constant), the gas constant describes the change in energy of one mole of an ideal gas per 1 degree Kelvin of temperature change. In other-other words, it describes the relationship between the temperature of a mole of ideal gas and the energy contained within that gas, in terms of whatever units you write it in. So if, for example, you write it in J K^-1 mol^-1 as you usually do, it expresses a relationship between energy (Joules) and temperature and number of moles (K and mol).  In other-other-other words, it describes the relationship between macroscopic moles and degrees of temperature and microscopic number of particles and energy per particle. It's a conversion factor between the scales of everyday lab thermodynamics and the scales of particle physics. (EDITED because "Boltzmann" is hard to spell.)
It would not explode. It would rupture and burn, for sure, but not explode.  For something to explode, you need the fuel to be mixed well with oxidizer, allowing the whole thing to ignite at once. In the scenario you posit, only the surface would be exposed to air
Well the B Vitamins are completely different unrelated chemicals. They got named together because they all got discovered together and only later it was found out it was actually a mix of substances. There are also gaps in the numbers because even later we discovered some of them weren't actually Vitamins
Super cold things burn because they’re physically damaging the body and killing cells. When you touch a bit piece of metal and burn yourself, the heat energy form the metal enters your hand and starts damaging/killing cells, setting of your pain nerves. When you touch an ice cube and your hand/finger feels cold/numb, the ice cube isn’t actually damaging you, it’s just cooling your cells down, which makes your nerves cells work less which causes the reduction of pain/numbness feeling. When you touch some extremely cold, like liquid nitrogen, then that is so cold that IT IS actually instantly freezing and destroying/damaging cells, and that destruction/damage is what sets off your nerves to make you feel pain.
The yellowing is residual dirt and sweat residue that doesn’t fully clean out during a wash.  You need something stronger. Trying to get white laundry back to white is why companies sell bleach.
It’s not air, it’s actually water vapour. When water boils, it turns from liquid water to gas water, but still just water. Some of the bubbles may be from dissolved gases coming out of solution as the water warms (warm water can’t hold as much dissolved gas as cold water), but the big bubbles of boiling water is just water vapour.
It takes a lot of energy.   In oil, most of that energy cost was paid by ancient micro-organisms collecting the energy from the sun.
Charcoal isn't burnt. It's pyrolysed, which is a different process. Plants are made mostly of cellulose and (in the case of wood) lignin, which are complex molecules that contain a lot of carbon. Burning a plant reacts those molecules with oxygen in the air to produce mostly carbon dioxide and water, which are both gases at the temperature of a flame and thus fly away into the air. (In practice, flames are usually a bit 'dirty' and contain a number of other things too.) There are two steps to this chemical reaction: *breaking* the bonds in the molecules that already exist (which consumes some energy) and then *recombining* the resulting parts with oxygen (which releases more energy than the first step consumed, so both steps together produce energy on net). In charcoal, wood or other organic material is heated, but not supplied with enough oxygen for a true flame. For example, it might be buried in a pile below ground with only a little oxygen available. This heating causes the first step of the reaction, breaking down the complex organic molecules into mostly free carbon + other stuff. But there's not enough oxygen for much of the second step to take place, so it stops there. (In practice, a little oxygen is introduced - just enough to allow enough of the second step to happen to keep the pile of material hot enough to continue breaking down.) This first step alone is called *pyrolysis* (Greek: *pyro* "fire" + *lysis* "to break down"). The resulting charcoal is effectively a chunk of mostly-pure carbon, which burns with a cleaner and hotter flame because many impurities have been removed (particularly water, which takes a lot of energy to evaporate) and because it doesn't have to consume energy to allow the first step of the reaction.
Imagine that they invent a substance so sweet (much sweeter than sugar) that less than a calorie of that substance can sweeten a whole bottle of Diet Coke. Now use that substance for this purpose.
Dry shampoo is a spray on powder that will absorb the extra oil in your hair. They often have added scents to make your hair smell good. They don’t actually remove dirt or clean your hair like traditional shampoos do.
Methyl salicylate absorbs ultraviolet light from excited nitrogen, and then re-emits the energy as a blue light.  This is fluorescence. Crystallized sugar also emits a very faint light through a similar mechanism.  This is called triboluminescence.
Quantum mechanics dictates that the electrons within atoms can only exist at discreet energy levels. These energy levels are different depending on what atom you have, and are also different for molecules vs individual atoms. When you hit an atom with light, it absorbs it, and goes into a higher energy level.  Then, the atom can emit a new beam of light, but because of that restriction, that light can only be of certain energy levels, and the energy of light is determined by its color. So, if you look at what color your object emits, you can determine what atom emitted that light. They're "read" by comparing them to the spectral lines emitted by known atoms.
Meat is tough if it has a lot of connective tissue, which is collagen.  Cooking it for a long time turns that to gelatin. As for savory flavor, that's coming from ingredients with *umami*. > Foods that have a strong umami flavor include meats, shellfish, fish (including fish sauce and preserved fish such as maldive fish, sardines, and anchovies), tomatoes, mushrooms, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, meat extract, yeast extract, cheeses, and soy sauce. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami Obviously some of those can't be used in vegan cooking, but some can. Drying mushrooms and tomatoes concentrates their flavor. I'm not sure if processed MSG powder counts as vegan, but if so you can add a bit of that.
Its called sewer sludge or biosolids. A lot of it is used as fertilizer on farm land after it meets testing requirements, I think.. Basically its seperated and dried out then spread.  EPA information is here -> https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/basic-information-about-biosolids
Standard cocaine is a water-soluble powder. You normally absorb it through various membranes (the gums, the nose, etc.). Crack cocaine is a cheaper, easier form of 'freebasing' - a technique where you make chemical changes to permit melting the cocaine into a gas that can be inhaled. By consuming the cocaine in this way, it reaches the blood stream much more quickly. This allows using a relatively small amount of cocaine to get an immediate and intense high.
a Mole is a number, like a dozen donuts is 12 donuts. It comes from the need for chemists to be able to relate number of atoms to a reasonable size. One mole is defined as the number of atoms in 12 grams of Carbon, and that turns out to be 6.022 x 10^23 . So you can then use it along with how heavy your atoms are to see how many atoms are in whatever sample you have. It's useful for transferring between "number of atoms" and "mass of your sample" through the value called "molar mass", which is a number for each atom that says how many grams 1 mole would be.
Soap/detergents don't break oil down.  They simply emulsify it, or hold it in suspension.  It is still 100% oil, just distributed differently... in the water rather than on the water.
I have the opposite, a nice beer tastes a better when I eat a Döner with it. Maybe it's some ingredient in your wings that prime your tongue for a certain taste and you taste less of the flavour of your beer and more the alcohol.
There is chemical energy in stored in gas, which released in the form of heat when burned, an internal combustion engine turns this heat into pressure, and that pressure into motion. It does this by burning gas in the cilinders which push the pistons, which in turn rotate the crankshaft, which after some gearing rotates the weels of the car, and provides power to the cars electrical systems.
It reduces the [surface tension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension) of water because it has [surfactants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant) like [alcohol ethoxylate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethoxylation). Normally, water likes to "clump" or stick together as water droplets. This wouldn't be a problem, except the water in your dishwasher isn't pure: tap water has a bunch of dissolved solids in it, like calcium, magnesium, and other minerals. These solids are left behind after the water evaporates, and your dishes get "water spots". By breaking the surface tension, water doesn't stick together and instead "sheets" off your dishes, taking the dissolved minerals with it. So your dishes stay clear.
The celsius scale was invented first, and set 0 as the freezing point of water and 100 as its boiling point. Those are nice memorable, measurable temperatures. Later on scientists worked out that absolute zero is -273.15 celsius. At some point scientists started thinking "wouldn't it be easier to count up from absolute zero rather than be dealing with minus numbers?" So they decided to make a scale starting at absolute zero. But what *size* should the units be? Well why not just make them the same size as the units in celsius, which everyone already knows? That's nice and simple. So we ended up with two scales where the units are the same size, but which start at different points.
The common definition of flammable means "will readily burn in the presence of oxygen, if you get it hot enough". Oxygen isn't flammable because it doesn't burn in the presence of... itself. It's not flammable, it's the stuff that *makes everything else* flammable.
They start to absorb the air particles, dust, bacteria, and odors around them. Therefore, they lose their “fresh” scent.
Mass for sure and of course the number of each atom involved - as far as chemistry is concerned (ie no radioactive decay). So if the reaction starts with a mole of a certain atom, it will end with a mole of that atom (whether reacted or not).
When a women becomes pregnant, her body starts produced tons of hormones to prepare her body to sustain and carry the child. Some of these hormones will begin to collect in the woman's urine with days or weeks of fertilization. The tests work by triggering a two phase chemical reaction. The first reaction basically just detects water, that's the first, "not pregnant" line. The second stripe contains a chemical that changes color when it reacts with the hormones, but it takes more time. Think of it this way, there's a ton of water in pee so that's easy to detect, there's only a tiny bit of hormones so they're harder to find. So you'll always get that first stripe, if you don't it's a sign the test is defective. The second line, if it appears, takes a while because it's the part that's actually "doing something".
It's like the case with keeping a water in a pot to cool down but reversed. The surface water takes the heat and evaporates leaving behind colder water
It feels cold because it evaporates easily. When the volatile liquids evaporate into a gas they pull a little heat from whatever surface they are in contact with. As a result when you touch acetone a small amount of it evaporates off stealing heat from your fingertip.
Water is indeed an exception. It's a very unusual molecule. The reason it's unusual is because of the very polar nature of water molecules: the electrons in the bonds are much more attracted to the oxygen than they are to the hydrogens, so the oxygen ends up with a partial negative charge and the hydrogens end up with partial positive charges. This means that water forms strong [hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond) between water molecules. These hydrogen bonds result in ice taking a very unusually open structure for a solid, and liquid water being unusually dense for such a light compound. The combination of the two lets water be slightly denser than ice, unlike almost all other known solids. Water is unusual in other ways, too: * Its highly polar nature makes it really good at dissolving other polar molecules. * It's liquid at room temperature, unlike nearly every other light molecule, because the hydrogen bonds stick its molecules together. Compare CO2 (gaseous well below room temp) or ethanol (boils at 78C), both of which are much heavier molecules. * It has very high surface tension, again because of the strong attraction between water molecules.
LiPO batteries have performance issues under 50° F (10° C) There’s a balance between temperature tolerance, recharge cycles, energy capacity, etc. Every chemistry has pros and cons.
It’s better to spray the cleanser upon the surface to be cleaned. The cleaning implement is absorbent. So applying cleanser unto it does not guarantee that all the applied cleanser will touch the surface to be cleaned. That amount of cleanser will be wasted.
You have hundreds of kinds of cells, many of which are found only in certain tissues.  Each cell has surface features (receptors) that respond to specific hormones, and these receptors differ between cell types.  Nowadays, a drug that does something to your kidneys (for example) consists in part of a key to some receptor that only kidney cells have; in other words, it disguises itself as a hormone that kidney cells expect, so kidney cells – and no other cells – let the drug in to do its thing. Disclaimer: not a biologist!
They can take the real food or whatever the flavor comes from and run it through a machine (mass spectrometer) that can tell them exactly what chemicals in the exact quantity’s the material has. Once they know the formula they can find other sources of those chemicals and combine them in the same formula.  It’s similar to a recipe used to cook food. It’s all about the materials used in the right portions.
that shouldn't be the case. can you outline the steps you took in your experiment?
Sometimes the coating on the pill protects what’s inside until they’re ready to be broken down in your stomach, liver etc. I know with Sertraline, for example, you can’t chew them or swallow them dry because if they stick in your throat and start to break down, the contents can damage it pretty badly.
Superglue contains cyanoacrylate which is an acrylic monomer. When this is exposed to air, it actually reacts with the moisture which causes it to form tight chains between the two surfaces once cured. Hope that helps.
Space time, space time, Einstein's theory of special relativity for it to work, space-time has to be a single fabric, Thus when you stretch or bend space, you are effecting time. For more detailed on how this "might" work, its way beyond anything reddit can provide.
To be able to see stars, it needs to be reasonably dark around you. To be able to see them well, it needs to be reasonably dark quite far away from you, as well. All of us folks who live a bit rurally know this already; you can see kind of where a city is if you look at the horizon, because even 20 miles away the sky will have a faint glow at night because of all the lights in the city. And that light, the light that helps us spot cities from quite a few miles away, that light is very much claiming it's space in a city. It comes from light sources that are not aimed right. Street lights that have poorly fitted reflectors. Lights in peoples windows that shine more out in the air than into the room. Car headlight. And so on. *Some* lights are deliberately aimed out into pitch dark air, such as lights that help aircraft navigate. But those are not really a big deal, compared to all the unnecessary lights of a city. The whole concept even got a name; light pollution. Light pollution makes it difficult, or even impossible, to distinguish stars on the night sky. Or makes it difficult to see...say... the Milky Way as a cloud of sorts behind many intense stars. This is one of many reasons why astronomers want to place their telescopes on plateau's in deserts in sparsely populated parts of the world. (there is more to it than that, but this bit definitely helps with the reasoning.)
Cannon is only used as a prop term. Basically what it is inside the barrel is a big piston. When the person climbs in the cannon they are standing on top of it. When it is "fired" it is just pushing the person up at a fast enough rate to launch them to the net or whatever they are aiming at not too terribly far away. Add in some pyrotechnics and smoke and noise and voila, you got yourself what appears to be a cannon shooting a circus performer. It would be similar to you standing on the seat of a seesaw, and your fat friend Kevin jumps from the top of the jungle gym onto the other end, launching you into a broken leg and a disappointed parent.
The ground is big. It's usually a reasonably good assumption that, no matter what us monkeys are doing above the surface, we can't pump enough electrons into or out of the ground to significantly affect the balance of electrons and protons— so the electric potential of the ground is always 0V. >And does everything have this special ability? Or a little of it? The special ability is bigness. Some things have more of it than others.
There are two main things happening in a star such as our sun, and they oppose each other. It's actually a really delicate balancing act. 1. The core of the star is fusing hydrogen into helium at an enormous rate. These fusion reactions produce vast amounts of heat and pressure, and that pressure means the core is constantly trying to expand -- just like when you heat water in a kettle, the steam tries to expand and get out of the kettle. 2. However a star is also really, really large. And even though gas is very light, there's enough of it in the outer layers of the sun that gravity is trying to squeeze all of those outer layers inward. So there's your balancing act: the core is trying to expand outwards, and the outer layers are trying to squeeze inwards. For much of its life a star like our sun will generally balance those two forces so that it appears as a more-or-less constantly shining object. But what happens if the nature of the atoms making up the star changes? As mentioned above the star shines because the core is fusing hydrogen atoms into helium atoms. There is enough hydrogen in the core for this to continue for a long, long time (billions of years). But eventually all the hydrogen will be used up, and so the sun's "fuel" will have gone. Your initial thought about this "well it's run out of fuel, so it will collapse" is actually correct. Initially the sun *will* start to contract when its hydrogen is used up. But as it contracts the pressure on the core gets greater (as all the "stuff" in the star is now compressed into a tighter area) and as the pressure goes up, so does the temperature. Quite quickly it reaches a temperature where it's hot enough to begin a different type of fusion reaction, this time fusing helium atoms into carbon and oxygen atoms. And of course there are a *lot* of helium atoms in the core by now, as the sun will have spent 12-13 billion years patiently converting all that hydrogen to helium. So, with a renewed even more powerful fusion reactor burning at its core once again, the outwards core pressure is more than enough to counteract the pressure of the collapsing star, and because the helium reaction releases more energy the outer layers of the star are pushed outwards. The star (our sun) will become much larger than it is at the moment due to this increased core pressure. But as it increases in size, the temperature of the outer layers cools. The star's colour changes from yellow-white to orange-red. The sun has become a red giant (and, incidentally, raised the temperature on earth way beyond anything that life could survive).
The units are a bit complicated, but 8.4 microSieverts per hour isn't something to worry about for short periods. I wouldn't hang out there, but I also wouldn't be worried about spending a significant amount of time there. Your normal dose of background radiation from living on the Earth is about 3 milli-Sieverts which is 3000 micro-Sieverts. You'd have to be in that area for a little over two weeks to pick up a year's worth of radiation, so a visit to pretend you're brave for being there isn't a significant dose.  Anyway, radiation units. There are two things to measure when it comes to radiation: exposure and dose. Exposure is the amount of radiation energy you absorbed. It's measured in Grays and one Gray is 1 Joule of radiation per kilogram. This is a tremendous amount of radiation and getting it all at once would give you pretty serious radiation sickness, but you'd probably survive. To make things more manageable we use milli-gray and micro-Grays.  That's not the whole story because different types of radiation will affect you differently. For example, absorbing 1 Gray of neutrons is 2-10 times more damaging to your cells than 1 Gray of gamma rays. The Sievert is just the Gray times that damage factor, so 1 Gray of gamma rays is 1 Sievert and 1 Gray of neutrons is 2-10 Sieverts.
JWT is a really sensitive *infrared* telescope. That means any source of heat can interfere with measurements. That includes the earth and moon. JWT is specifically orbiting a "Lagrange point". At Lagrange point 2, all the major heat sources (sun, earth, and moon) are always all on one side of the telescope. Then a heat shield on this side can block out any interference.
When water boils, it's getting so hot that parts of it are becoming a gas, pushing the rest of the water away and rising up in bubbles to escape as steam. As you heat a pot of water from the bottom, the bottom layers get hot enough to boil first. Bubbles of steam form and rise into the relatively cooler water. Here the steam cools and loses energy until it can no longer hold the water apart anymore to form a bubble. Suddenly the bubble collapses as the water slams down around it.    This is the loud sound you hear, and it goes away once the water is heated throughout and the bubbles can pass through it to escape by popping more quietly at the surface.    If you stir a pot of boiling water vigorously as it heats up, you can get rid of this loud phase of boiling.
On the contrary a moving vehicle will create a lot of dynamic forces in addition to the static force of its weight so it will cause more damage the faster it goes. You do sometimes see speed limits for trucks on bridges for this reason. And overweight cargo permits might also include special speed limits for certain bridges. In extreme cases you might see a very overweight truck crawl over a closed off bridge at walking pace to reduce the stress on the bridge.
It does tug on grains of sand a little. But grains of sand are very small. Even the ocean, which is less rigid than a grain of sand, deforms only by a matter of a meter or two on an ocean thousands of meters deep, and that kind of deformation isn't something you'd notice from a sand grain. But in fact, the solid Earth *does* bend with the tides too, it's just not visible on the scale of a grain of sand (and you don't notice it relative to structures because they bend the same way since they move along with their foundations). The ground [rises and falls by around a foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_tide) twice a day with the tides. It doesn't rise and fall as far as the ocean does because rock is, to put it mildly, better at holding its shape than water. But on these scales, rock is effectively a very thick liquid, and it does act like it for the purposes of the tides.
Simply put the salt makes it harder for water molecules to phase change to gas,  so it needs to be hotter to do so.
If you refer to "something" as the whole universe itself, the best answer we have summarizes to "if there was nothing, we couldn't observe it". That's the anthropomorphic principle. Arguably this answers "how do we know there is something rather than nothing?". The why sounds like it would be more meta physics or philosophy than actual physics...
Inertia is the tendency of things to keep the speed they have. You need a force to speed things up or slow them down. Momentum puts that to a numerical value. It's the velocity times mass. A force will slowly build up momentum in the direction it's pointing. And you will need the same Force×Time in the other direction to stop it again.
You have the strength to exceed the 9.8m/s2 of gravity’s pull.  You do it every day whenever you stand up or walk up a hill. You can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps because you're counteracting what you pull with by being pulled because you're attached to yourself.  You pull up with your arms by X Newton?  Your bootstraps pull back down by the same amount.  The net force on your total body is always 0 no matter how hard you pull.
It varies by gas. Nitrogen and oxygen are mostly captured from the air.  If you put air in a container and cool it, the first liquid that forms is nitrogen.  You put that in a tank and then warm it to gas for delivery to a nitrogen tank customer.  Oxygen is the next gas to condense, so that works the same way. Argon is also extracted from air. CO2 is made chemically, with Hydrogen, from air and natural gas.
Moisture can still condense on the inside of a bottle, even after you have consumed the contents.
The danger produced by MRIs when it comes to metal has to do with magnetism. Chances are your ring is not made of a magnetic substance, like gold, silver, or platinum.
Gravity is expressed as acceleration.  As long as you are accelerating, your mass experiences weight.  When you and your craft are no longer increasing in speed, but are traveling at the same speed, you experience apparent weightlessness.  Also, deceleration provides the same effect of weight, which is why you tug against the seat belts when braking hard.
We don't really perceive temperature. Instead, we perceive the rate at which hear enters or leaves our skin. When you touch a hard surface, it can feel "colder" because it's better at taking heat away from your skin than carpet
It doesn’t perfectly reflect all light. So if you stare long enough you can see the silver surface behind the reflection. If you look at it from an angle it’s even more obvious, since there’s less outside light to reflect. The same thing happens with a less reflective surface like a window or polished car. Except there so much light gets absorbed that you have to looks straight at the shiny surface in good light to see any reflection at all. And what you see is a more ghostly reflection that doesn’t obscure what’s behind the window or the color of the car.
The weak force doesn't make itself obvious to us in daily life, as do electromagnetism and gravity.  So we unfortunately can't build our intuition that way. To assess what the weak force "does", we'd attend to the initial conditions & final conditions before/after a weak-force-mediated particle process, and take inventory of everything: particle species that are present, their energies, and momenta, etc. That takes us closer to building intuition about the "effect" of the charged-current weak-force interactions: we tabulate the energies of the particles that are present before/after, and imagine how conservation of momentum and conservation of energy will divvy up the momentum and energy among the final particles.  We know we'll see some new particles, and they'll be leaving the interaction point at some different angles, with various energies. As you mentioned, the most interesting consequence of the charged-current weak force interactions is: it's the only force in nature that can change one kind of quark into another kind (allowing our sun's fusion processes, among other things).
Rocket engines produce *a lot* of thrust. For example, the Falcon Heavy produces 5.13 million pounds-force of thrust at lift-off.
When a car is moving at a fixed speed, it does not experience any force (besides gravity and the normal force from the ground). We're ignoring air because this is physics 101 and air does not exist. Thus, a car going 40 mph experiences the same force as a car going 60; zero. If you get *hit* by a car, you accelerate from zero speed to car speed in a fraction of a second, and the force on your body is thus tremendous. The car, likewise, decelerates slightly, as that force applies in both directions.
Yep.  It’s generally bad to be nearby a lightning strike in the water.  The water is pretty conductive, so decent amounts of current will spread out and zap the fish. If it didn’t work, the electric eels wouldn’t have figured out how to do it.
For an object to bounce, it has to absorb all of the energy of an impact in an elastic fashion. When you bend a spring a little bit, it will spring back after you let go. This is elastic deformation - it changes shape temporarily and it pushes in order to return to its normal shape. When you bend it a lot, it does not fully return to its original shape. This is *plastic* deformation. In plastic deformation, the energy put into bending the object becomes heat. In elastic deformation, the energy is returned to motion. Different materials and collisions experience different collision characteristics. A steel ball may bounce on a concrete floor in a gentle collision, but at higher speeds it will bounce much less, and a corresponding dent will form on the ball (or in the floor) where it hit. Worth realizing is that both the ball and the floor deform. A carpet deforms mostly in a plastic fashion, and so almost regardless of the ball, not much bouncing happens on carpet. Carpet is interesting because it is largely friction-driven. The fibers in the carpet rub up against one another and so friction prevents the collision from behaving elastically.
So it's not just the red shifting of light, but it's the rewinding of things.     The idea is if you run things backwards, that would be the time at which everything is in a single point again.     There's a lot of assumptions in that, but different methods all get about the same answer.
Yes. It melts slower when the surrounding temperature is closer to the ice cream’s temperature (colder).
Stellar-mass black holes are quite small, astronomically speaking. The supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies are the largest objects in the universe, but their formation mechanism is a bit of a mystery.  They’re *much* larger than any star could ever be, and many are much larger than even 13 billion years of sucking down space trash could muster.
When your home thermostat calls for cooling at, say 72 degrees F, your air conditioning unit is producing air that is 35 to 45 degrees F. You may feel that cold air circulating as it mixes with the air in the room to keep the room at your desired temperature. This is why some people run their system fan constantly, to keep the air moving and mixing.  Similarly, when heating a room to 72 degrees F, your forced air furnace is producing air at anywhere from 110 degrees F to 170 degrees F and sending it into your room.  Outdoors, the air heats and cools more or less uniformly in a given area.
Toss a pebble in a calm pond and watch what happens to the ripples over time. Sound's a lot like that. First you hear it as the ripples pass you. Then, if you're close enough to a fairly straight shore, you might hear it again as the ripples bounce back and pass under you a second time - this is an echo. Eventually the ripples spread out from each other so far that you can't see them (or in the case of sound, hear them). This can happen a lot faster if there's a slight breeze that's riffling the water, which is why background noise like the leaves on trees blowing in the wind makes it harder to hear distant sounds.
A color is based on the light that the material reflects. So if something reflects white, it is reflecting all the colors. If something reflects red, it is reflecting only the red wavelengths. But something that is black (or darker colors) is absorbing the majority of the light that is hitting it, so it doesn’t really reflect much color at all.  That’s why black things get hotter than white things in the sun, because the white is reflecting a lot of light, while the black is absorbing a lot of light. And when the light is absorbed, it is converted to heat.
An “atom” bomb is called that because it uses energy from splitting atoms to power it. Only specific types of atoms can split, release energy, and also cause additional atoms (of similar type) to also split, release energy, and continue the reaction. The atoms that can do this are called “fissile” (splittable) atoms, so not all atoms can be used in an atom bomb.
Two questions: why shouldn’t you, and why can’t you.  First, why shouldn’t you? Because you will crash your car, either by skidding or rolling. The car has a lot of momentum trying to move it forward and if you ask the tires so change direction too much and too quickly, they won’t be able to.  Secondly, why can’t you? Well, you can but it’s just harder. And it’s harder because cars are specifically designed to make it harder. Here’s a mini-history of power steering. In the beginning there was no power steering. The steering wheel was directly connected to the wheels, and it was quite hard to steer. When maneuvering at slow speeds where you wanted to turn the wheels a lot, it was really hard. You needed quite a lot of strength.  Then came power steering. When you turned the steering wheel, the car would detect it and help you turn. It became much easier to steer than before, particularly when you wanted to turn the wheels a lot.  However there was a problem at high speeds. It was so easy to turn that when to turned the wheel just a little bit, like you want at high speed, it felt like the steering wheel was just floating: there wasn’t enough control.  So they made adaptive power steering (or various other phrases for the same thing). It was designed so that at low speeds it would help you turn the steering wheel a lot, to allow you to maneuver easily, and at high speeds it would hardly help at all so you felt like you had control, and didn’t turn the wheels too much by mistake.
what kills you is the energy, which is volt x amp, besides, volt is like pressure between two points, a difference potential, and amp is like liquid flow, the energy flow, now, whatt/hour is like the amount of water that has flown and about the "n" big volts, half are lies and half have not enough energy flow to hurt you
No electrons don't move through the air. EM waves are actually carried by photons and visible light is a specific form of it (a specific frequency band) Electromagnetism are the forces caused by electrons. If I move an electron back and force it will propagate the forcefield around it in a waveform. Just like waving a piece of wood in water causes waves of pressure moving through the water. The wood stays where it is, but the force expands carried by a medium. And the EM field doesn't actually need a medium.
In the real world, air resistance is constantly slowing you down. The faster you go, the more fuel you need to maintain your speed because your acceleration needs to match the force of air resistance pushing against you.
You're hot. And if the air is standing still around you, you heat up that air and stay inside your own "warmth Bubble". So Wind takes that Bubble away and replaces it with room temperature which you have to warm up again (which steals warmth from you). It's the same when you blow on hot food to make it colder. You replace the layer of hot air with room temp which cools the food down.
As best we understand the physics, there is not a hard limit. However, the expansion is not strong enough to pull apart objects that are bound together by gravity or other forces, so as long as structures exist at all they'll be safe from the expansion of the Universe. That said, structures aren't totally eternal as we understand the cosmos today, and it is likely that in the very, very, very far future the Universe will consist of isolated particles (primarily photons) so distant from one another that none of them can observe any other. As for how - well, why *wouldn't* it be able to? It *already* stretched by a factor of untold billions just after the Big Bang, so in a sense we're already *in* a very, very stretched-out Universe.
What you're describing is a [hidden variable theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory). It's known that no such theory where the hidden information is local (that is, it's a property of the particles themselves that can't be communicated faster than light) can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics. So the only way you can get it to work is to assume faster-than-light communication between particles (or, if you prefer, some sort of underlying universal variable accessible by all particles no matter where they are, which amounts to the same thing).
Crystals are things that are reflective of their structure in 3 dimensions. The repeating patterns of the crystal are the same repeating patterns as the molecular make up. Time is another dimension akin to the spatial dimensions, so if you were to upscale from 3 dimensions to 4, adding time, you would have a regular repeating pattern through time. Hence, time crystal. As for how it could be used, that's interesting. You can't really extract work from them without violating the laws of thermodynamics (if change over time, like a repeating pattern is, is harnessable and taking place without some form of energy then the 'energy can neither be created nor destroyed' bit is gonna be an issue) so applications are uncertain.
It has to do with how the difference between how fast the thing is spinning and how fast your vision (or screen) updates.   If they are the same then then thing may look like it’s not spinning.  If  the thing is spinning slightly slower than the refresh rate of your vision then it may appear to be rotating backwards For example, a box fan seen on TV.   Let’s pretend you have a very old TV and it only refreshes the screen once a second (1 hz).  If the fan is also rotating at 1hz then the blades will be in the exact same position every time the TV snaps a picture.  They will do a full rotation in between TV image updates.   Now, if it’s slightly slower, sat 0.9hz then the fan will only complete 90% of one rotation in between snaps.   When comparing the two images it could appear that the fan actually rotated 10% in the other direction.
It'd totally depend on how they were killed. If they were vaporised then so too probably would be the bow and arrow. If they were hit by a really fast car then even if the arrow was released as they died chances are the impact would force its aim away from you. I'd say chances are that it'd miss or not even be released in a way that would allow it to travel far.
From my understanding wind is caused by the heating differences on earth. Heat rises Cold lowers So as these differences interact it causes energy to build up and be expelled via wind
Air is flowing into the air canal and getting trapped without a way out. This creates a high pressure air bubble that all incoming air must go around, and actually reducing the amount of buffeted air that can reach your ear drum
Watts are "just" volts x amps. They are also the unit of "power" - how much total energy is being pushed through the circuit per second.
Our two eyes being a few centimeters apart gives us two slightly different 2D pictures which allows the brain to calculate the 3D shape from that difference. At large distances that difference becomes so minuscule that you only get the same 2D image twice and thus there is no 3D shape to calculate.
You have a giant block of metal generating tons of heat inside your hood. Your car's "heater" is just harnessing that engine heat and using dampers, fans, etc. to control how much of that hot air to allow into the cabin. As for the glass, you're gradually heating the glass and the glass is extra strong, tempered, laminated glass designed to withstand heat shifts, impacts, etc.
Huh? No. The slam would mean they're going *faster*, not slower. If you're asking "could you use friction to slow a fall" - well, yes, that's essentially what you're doing if you grab a handhold.
Power = torque * RPM.  At low RPM, most of the power goes towards just keeping the engine running. At midrange RPM, you are producing more power but your friction losses haven't really increased, so more of the torque gets out of the engine.  At very high RPM it gets harder to get the fuel and air into the engine fast enough to keep up with the piston, causing the torque to drop off.
You're partly wrong. You have the times correct,  but only for those instances. You could boil water faster or slower than 3 minutes; you can freeze water faster or slower than hours as well. It depends how much water and how fast or slow too. You can give the water energy or take energy away from it, and this can be done in different ways.
Current (amperage) (I) is the amount of charge particles that are moving. Those particles moving through your body (specifically the heart) is what kills you. Voltage (V) is the amount of force trying to move those particles. This is determined by the source of the electrical power (e.g. a *9-Volt* battery). There’s a fundamental relationship between current (I) and voltage (V): Ohm’s law. > V = I * R The “R” is resistance, or impedance, which represents how hard it is to move charged particles through something. Ohm’s law says that objects with high resistance (i.e. poor conductors) require more force to move charge particles through them. So the same force (voltage) can move fewer charged particles (current) through a poor conductor (high resistance) than through a good conductor (low resistance). Your body, and specifically your skin, has very high resistance (when dry). This means that, for a given voltage, current will be fairly low and thus not able to cause major harm. However, if you change the resistance all of a sudden by, say, accidentally cutting your skin or getting it wet, now that same voltage will generate a much larger current that can kill you. As an aside, there is such a thing as a *microshock*, which is when a tiny amount of current passes directly through the heart and disrupts it’s function. This can pretty much only happen during some kind of surgery where the heart muscles are directly exposed to a source of electricity.
Gravity. Most places rely on water towers.  They have two purposes.  They store water.  (So a pump can run at 100% to fill the tower up, then it can turn off, until needed.  This is what provides the water pressure.  To do this, water towers are often built on hills, and they are one of the tallest objects around.  So as long as your house is lower than the elevation of your water tower, gravity is ultimately pushing the water down, as overall the force of the water tower's drop is more than the elevation to the second floor of your house. And if you have a high rise building downtown, they just use pumps to push the water up.  But even then, they often have a storage tank on the top floor or roof.  So then gravity can provide the water pressure needed.
by definition of being "infinite" you dont assume it ends. what we understand as an "end" is the fact that you can only see so far with current technology: we call this border the "Observable Universe".  for all you know that the end,,,but we do not know because we cant see any further, that light hasnt reached us
A nuclear reactor uses radioactive materials as their fuel source. A chain reaction is started where neutrons slam into the other atoms which in turn also shoot off neutrons. But these neutrons are flying away at a high rate of speed, and they need to be slowed down a bit to make them more likely to hit another atom; this is where the moderator comes in. There are a few different things that can do this function, even just water. To control the reaction so they can make it happen more slowly over time instead of releasing all that insane energy at once, things such as control rods (which instead absorb neutrons instead of just slowing them down) are also put in the reactor. All this neutron whizzing about breaking other atoms like a cue ball on a pool table creates heat, crazy amounts of heat. This is captured via what is called the primary loop, which is water that is being circulated through the reactor both to help keep it cool and to collect that heat. This then goes to an exchanger where the primary water heats up secondary water (you don't want the primary water which is being exposed to neutron radiation to be outside the containment), and this secondary water gets turned into steam. This is what actually drives the steam turbines. Tldr: Nuclear reactions are atoms losing pieces that bump into other atoms and make them break up too, this makes shitloads of heat. The heat is collected and used for running a steam turbine.
Electrons and by extension atoms are technically theoretical since we cannot directly observe them. Through indirect observation (Milliken Oil Drop experiment, etc), we are able to conclude with near certainly that atoms and electrons exist.
Air is dry. Your skin is wet. Blowing air has lower pressure, so your skin water evaporates faster than in regular air, taking more heat with it.  You sense a cooling effect.
The centrifugal force generated when you a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel\_roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_roll) will be stronger than gravity so there is always a net force in the normal "down" in the aircraft so you can pour the liquid. If you would do a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileron\_roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileron_roll) that would not work It is fundamentally not any different to if you have water in a bucket and spin it around in a circle with your hand. The water will stay in the bucket.
Yes the weight is the factor. The design places all the force on a specific point on the blade with the extra weight giving it more “punching” power. Late Medieval knights started carrying maces and axes only using swords as status or ceremonial weapons as they were ineffective against plate armor of the time.
Current flows through all available paths all the time. The one with the least resistance will naturally have the most current flowing through it. In the case of, say, a person, their resistance is either *way* lower or *way* higher than the alternative, so the "path of least resistance" is a decent way to predict where most current will go. However, that's in conductors and resistors. Insulators experience something called breakdown, where enough current will cause a sudden huge drop in resistance. This is what arcing is through air. It means that the path with marginally less resistance almost instantly becomes the path of *way* less resistance when enough voltage is applied.
It’s about angular momentum: when the arms work like pendulums they limit the direction of motion.  That way, the legs can focus on acceleration instead of stabilization.
As water gets hotter, its viscosity becomes lower. The change is enough to make the sounds distinct. Same mechanism as with engine oil. Starting your car on a cold day can sometimes cause unexpected problems because the cool lubricant is thicker and has to warm up before it works as intended.
When things freeze, the process depends not only on how cold it is, but also if there's a good spot for the ice crystals to start forming. Good spots for the freezing to start are things like sharp deformations in the container, or places where the liquid has been disturbed by stirring or shaking. It's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle: it gets easier if you start with the edge pieces. So when a can of beer is sitting stationary in the freezer in a clean, smooth can, there's not a lot of good spots for the ice crystals to start forming. This lets it cool a bit below its freezing point before it starts to freeze. When you pour the beer, you create good spots for it to freeze by disturbing the beer in the process of pouring it into the glass and getting everything all shaken up. Once a few ice crystals start to form the whole beer can start freezing. The same thing happens with boiling. If you microwave water in a very clean glass, you can get it above the boiling point without it boiling. If you shake the glass or poke the surface with a spoon it will suddenly start boiling, which can be dangerous if you aren't expecting it. It's a similar issue except that it needs good spots for the bubbles to form rather than the ice crystals.
Light has no mass, but it does have *momentum* and momentum is conserved! So when a photon bounces off the mirrored sail, the sail must have some change in momentum for the momentum of the sail and photon together to be the same after the photon hits the sail as it was before! In more detail, but less ELI**5**:  Classical momentum requires mass, but that’s only a partial description and relativity gives a fuller picture. Recall the famous equation E = m c^2 ? That’s only part of the full equation, which reads: E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2 , where p is momentum. Since light has no mass, we can re-write this as: E = p c, so for a photon with  E = h c / l, where h is the Planck constant and l is the light’s wavelength, we can combine this with the above to give: p = h / l. So a smaller wavelength (bluer) photon carries more momentum!
From a physics perspective, heat is energy that is transferred from one body to another. Ie. from the warmer body to the colder body. Just think about an ice cube. If you put an ice cube in a warm room, heat is the energy transferred from the warm room into the ice cube, raising its temperature and causing it to melt. If you put a glass of water in a cold room, heat is the energy transferred from the water into the cold room, lowering the water's temperature until the water turns to ice. So how does that affect your body? All living organisms are essentially a symphony of complex chemistry. You're alive because many, many complex chemical reactions are constantly happening in your body. A simple example, when you digest your food, enzymes produced by your body are helping to break down your food in a series of chemical reactions. And you might remember from chemistry class that temperature can greatly affect chemical reactions. Those digestive enzymes don't work if your body is too cold and they might actually break down if your body is too hot. That's why cold-blooded animals like lizards have to warm up in the sun to reach the right temperature to digest their food. And warm-blooded animals like yourself produce their own heat and carefully regulate their body temperature to stay at the optimal temperature for their body chemistry to work. As a warm-blooded creature. Your body produces heat to stay at the perfect operating temperature. And you also attempt to cool down when you get too hot. For example, by sweating and by vascular dilation, ie. your blood vessels near the surface widen so you can radiate the excess heat in your blood. That's why you turn red when you're too hot. When circumstances make it impossible to manage your body heat properly, for example because you're in an environment that is far too cold or far too hot, you start to suffer the consequences. Hypothermia and hyperthermia are collective descriptions for the various ways you can suffer the consequences of heat or cold messing up your body's temperature management. Potentially fatally so.
From what I know it’s buffering. Like a transfer of air in and out. With one opening it’s fighting against the air rushing in and out. Creating the chopper sound. With the Second window open it allows the air a path to escape so it flows through the other window and not back out where it came in.
Your parents created you, inside the Universe.  The closed timelike curvature required to make a temporal causality loop is at best theoretical.  More likely, it's disallowed by the Universe.  You can theorize moving through space at any speed, but the speed of light is a hard limit enforced by the Universe.
Water is significantly better at absorbing and dissipating heat than air is. In fact, room temperature air loses heat around 43 times faster than water does. It also has a much higher heat capacity, which is the energy required to raise the temperature of the material by one degree. This means water can absorb a massive amount of energy from your skin, and only increase in temperature a very small amount.    When submerging your hand in water, it is much more efficient at pulling heat from your body than air is. Your skin cools to the temperature of the water, whereas still air cannot retain enough heat to be able to cool your skin down to ambient temperature like water does. This is why water always feels cooler than air.
Conservation of angular momentum. In a dust and hydrogen cloud all the particles are moving in basically every direction. But they don't perfectly cancel each other out, and as gravity pulls the cloud together until (if there's enough mass) a star forms, the imbalance in directions all those particles and molecules are moving form the spin. Repeat for everything at every scale
To accelerate yourself up, you need to push something else down. When you're standing on the ground that's pretty easy, but when you're in midair you only have the air and whatever you carried up with you.  You can jump just fine as long as you have something to push against.
Idk why this is flagged, this isn't speculation, there's a definitive answer.  The universe is huge. The universe has always been huge. We can already see light this old (it's called the cosmic microwave background),  although JWST will give us the best view we've ever had. The light is very old, because it's been traveling a very long time, because it started very far away. When the light was emitted, the things emitting that light were billions of light years away from the things that eventually became Earth (although not 13.5 billion light years, because of space expanding and relativity). The universe probably didn't begin as an infinitely dense point. The big bang was the universe expanding from everywhere all at the same time.
I found entropy very difficult to grasp in the first year of my chemistry undergrad - it really only clicked when I heard this explanation: Picture a container that contains 4 marbles. Think about the amount of different positions these marbles can take, a marble could be located in each of the bottom four corners, or they could also be in the top four corners or in several different positions. Now let’s increase the size/volume of this container. This would mean that these four marbles can take more positions, right? This is precisely what entropy is: molecules having the opportunity to take various positions within a given space. The greater the amount of rearrangements, the higher the entropy. So now let’s conclude with another example, let’s say you put a rubber ball in the oven, turn the heat on and the ball shrinks…. Now that the ball is smaller in this oven (because it has shrunk) do you think the entropy of that system will be higher or lower….. well it can take more rearrangements right, because the ball is smaller and the oven is the same size…. So the entropy is higher.  When talking about the different states of matter (solids, liquids and gas) - solids are more ordered, the particles are closer together and are less likely to take more positions (thereby reducing the amount of possible arrangements in a given volume). Gas particles are spread further apart and can assume more arrangement in a given volume, hence, a gas of the same molecule will have a higher entropy compared to the solid of that molecule.
It wouldn't spoil as it would be immediately dried since water boils at any temperature at such low pressures. (And with neither water nor oxygen available bacteria have a hard time) It wouldn't last forever though, it gets bombarded by radiation until it's molecules fall apart (how long that would take is hard to tell though)
Objects aren't perfectly smooth, the surface has ridges and valleys. This causes objects to basically get "stuck" one each other. which generates a force that resists the direction of motion. We call this friction.
You mean how do single-cell organisms, or for that matter, enzymes restructure molecules? it's all about patterns. molecule: "In my left hand i got a key. i don't know what for, and i don't really like it that much." enzymes: "hey, you, molecule passing by with that sweet set of ... keys. I got a matching keyhole. come here" molecule: "ooaaahh shieeewtt, noiice, lets go" enzymes: "haha jinks, i just cut off your arm. but don't worry. try grabbing the remains of your left arm with your right hand. trust me." molecule: "you fucked up SOB, this is so awesome." enzyme: "no problem. \*speaking to different molecule\*: hey, i got an arm. you want it!!" &#x200B; chemist Explanation: enzymes break molecular structures by having stronger binding agents.  this is only true for a small portion of enzymes. there are a lot more ways to change molecule structures than just "ripping off an arm". but this was the most entertaining to myself
The gap between room temperature and hot things is higher than the gap between room temperature and cold things. For example, for a room temp of 20 C / 68 F, a cold item near freezing (5 C / 41 F) is only 15 degrees C / 27 degrees F colder than the room. On the other hand, to stay food safe, a hot item needs to be above about 60 C / 140 F, which is 40 degrees C / 72 degrees F hotter than the room. The other reason is that vacuum flasks work by preventing *conductive* heat transfer (because there's nothing to conduct through). But they can't stop *radiative* transfer, caused by warm objects emitting small amounts of radiation (at human temperatures, typically infrared). That radiation scales up very quickly with temperature: while conductive transfer goes at a speed proportional to the difference in temperatures, *radiative* transfer goes at a speed proportional to the difference *of the fourth power* of temperature measured in Kelvin. Flasks are silvered (covered with reflective metals) to limit this effect, but radiative transfer scales so strongly that very hot contents can overcome it.
Wave particle duality is actually fairly well understood and described by quantum mechanics, it’s only a problem for classical mechanics to describe. Under basic quantum mechanics the fundamental object is the wavefunction, which can either be more localised (particle like) or less (wavelike).
Electrons have weight and mass, but electric*ity* isn't quite the same as electrons. Electricity is the movement of electrons. So your question is a bit like like asking "does sound have weight?" Like, air has weight, but maybe the vibrations *of* the air don't count as having weight.
They can steer their engines (or at least some of them if they have multiple). This is called “gimballing” if they move the whole engine, named for the mechanical support that lets you do it. Otherwise they use a variety of tricks inside the nozzle to redirect the thrust.  But no matter how you slice it, they’ve got a steerable component back there to keep things going straight.
It is not about how fast you are going, but how fast you are stopping. Acceleration (or deceleration) matters not speed. If you come to a full stop from 10, 50 or 100 mph in the same short amount of time obviously the 100 mph will mean you decelerate much harder, but if you take more time slowing down from a high speed that might be safer than to come to an abrupt stop from a slower speed. Cars crumple zones, air bags and other safety features are all designed to spread out the time it takes for you (more specifically your head) to come to a full stop. You can jump from several stories high into water with little ill effect, but simply falling flat on your face from onto concrete standing upright might seriously injure or even kill you. The water slows you down over a bit of time when you hit it, the concrete slows you down all at once. When you drive your car into a tree or wall that can be sudden even at slow speeds. (Even with all the safety features trying to help you). If you ski at high speeds into a tree that can be pretty deadly. If you ski and fall over and then spend several seconds and quite a bit of space to come to a full stop that is much less of an issue. Wearing a helmet, warm clothing and falling onto relatively soft snow helps a lot. It is all about how quickly you come to a stop, the longer it takes to slow down to stop the healthier.
Gamma, alongside other forms of ionizing radiation (x-rays, alpha, beta, and neutron), is dangerous because when it impacts matter it has enough energy to strip electrons off of atoms. Since the bonds of electrons are what hold molecules together, this splits molecules apart too. While this usually doesn't do any quick damage to large structures with many molecules, it can still cause wear, with the most common example being the embrittlement of plastics in sunlight. In the human body, this means that important cellular parts like your DNA get shredded by little gamma ray bullets, and so they stop doing their jobs. In the short term, this means your cells die and you get ill or die. If you survive acute exposure, other damage such as DNA damage can show up later on in life.
It’s to do with quantum mechanics and how he operates on a plane of time and space that us mortals can’t yet comprehend
It's not "split into two smaller packets", if that's what you're asking. The single packet is smeared out, passes through both slits, and continues to smear out in an interference pattern beyond them. All of that is "one photon".
He didn't... the existence of Atoms was theorized in 1827 by Robert Brown. What Einstein did was propose methods of measuring their size. "[It was Albert Einstein who, starting in his epochal year of 1905, published several papers that explained precisely how Brownian motion could be used to measure the size of atoms and molecules. (In 1905 Einstein created special relativity, proposed photons as quanta of EM radiation, and produced a theory of Brownian motion that allowed the size of atoms to be determined. All of this was done in his spare time, since he worked days as a patent examiner. Any one of these very basic works could have been the crowning achievement of an entire career—yet Einstein did even more in later years.) Their sizes were only approximately known to be 10−10 m, based on a comparison of latent heat of vaporization and surface tension made in about 1805 by Thomas Young of double-slit fame and the famous astronomer and mathematician Simon Laplace.](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/physics/chapter/30-1-discovery-of-the-atom/)"
It adds its weight to the weight of the water in the pool. Ie. A scale at the bottom of the water container would increase by the weight of the added mass.  But a common ”trick” question is: if a rock is in a boat floating in the pool and you drop the rock to the bottom of pool from boat, does the water level go up or down? (A: Water level goes down, because in the floting boat the rock displaced water equal to its weight, but in the bottom it displaces only its own volume of water which is a smaller amount.
Mythbusters tested this a long time ago. If it's genuinely shot *straight up*, then when it reaches its maximum height, it comes to a complete stop in the air. It loses its flying profile, and on the way down it will tumble and fall... not harmlessly, but its maximum speed on the way down will be much lower than it would be. I wouldn't want to be hit by it, but I think you'd survive especially if you had any half-decent helmet. If it were shot upwards but at an angle, a bullet can retain its flight profile when it reaches its peak and come back down as a deadly projectile, still pointy side first. There are documented cases of people being hit and killed from large distances when someone fired a gun into the air. Mythbusters called it busted, confirmed, and plausible all at the same time, since they had evidence of it actually killing someone, but also "straight up" is actually a hard thing to do for a human just pointing a gun upwards and firing. Shooting a gun "straight up" probably wouldn't be fatal, but you probably aren't actually going to do it that way in the first place.
The other common method is the shaker machine at hardware stores. It takes a good amount of time Because there's so little pigment to so much base, that you have to put a lot of mixing in to ensure that that little amount of pigment has gotten around that whole gallon bucket. The viscosity and small amount of empty room to move around inside the can also contribute to this, yes. It would probably be better if the pigment actively dissolved into it like food coloring does with say water, but the reality is the paint is just a carrier for the pigment.
Gravity is a fundamental force, as far as we know there's no "why". It just is. All matter with mass experiences an attractive force towards other matter with mass (or, all mass warps spacetime, if you're Einstein).
Airline pilot here: As someone else said, it's a regulatory loophole. I assume you were on some sort of regional jet, EMB175, CRJ 700/900, etc. Since you said "below', as the EMB145,l and CRJ 200 are 'behind', and larger aircraft are almost never affected by this situation. Bags put in the cargo area count as baggage weight, while carry-on bags are included in an average passenger weight. The average passenger weight just got increased at our airline, and it's reviewed periodically. The overall weight of the aircraft has to be below a certain weight for the expected runway of use. At large airport, there's usually a long runway available for takeoff that will allow for heavier weights. At smaller airports, there's just one runway for the prevailing wind, and that's more limiting. Reason why might be accelerate/stop distance (V1), obstacle climb necessities, airport altitude, and some other more obscure performance issues. Hope that helps. edit: you didn't say 'below' , so it coud've been any of them. edit 2: Gold? Aww shucks, guys and gals!
Why questions aren't actually really answerable in science.  They actually don't make sense.  How It just does.  That is what mass in spacetime does to spacetime.  That is just how the universe works.  It used to be said that gravity was a force and so scientists looked for a particle to transfer it but no such particle has ever been found.  It has scientists quite stumped.
The light might be mostly UV, but you can't really tell how much UV is seeping out.  The sticker has orange fluorescent pigment, which can be charged up my any short wavelength light.  UV provides the most dramatic effect, as it doesn't illuminate the surroundings, but it seems blue is good enough.
They are created. They appear. Such things are not super uncommon in high-energy physics. Photons require much less energy to form than most particles, so they form much more easily. Something like an electron-positron pair can form under sufficiently strong electric fields, while a proton-antiproton pair would require *way* higher fields.
Time is the distance between events, just like space is the distance between objects.  Nothing can experience time backwards.
Both. There isn't a fixed radius of "badness" around it. It's not like some discrete bubble around the material where on the inside of the bubble you get fried and on the outside nothing happens. There's just less radiation the further away you get. If you have twice as much radioactive material, you'll get twice the dose of radiation up close, and also twice the dose 10m away, and 50m away and 1km away.
If you weigh 99 pounds and eat one pound of carrots, you are 1% carrot. If you weigh 99 kilograms and eat one kilogram of carrots, you are 1% carrot. There's nothing contradictory about those two statements, and the framing of the question makes me think you have some serious misconception about how percentages work.
You absolutely can reflect radio waves - that's how a [dish antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_antenna) works, by reflecting all the incoming radio waves to one point at the center of the antenna.
Everything is made of atoms. The outer edges of atoms are made of particles called electrons. Each atom has specific numbers of electrons. If it has more or fewer electrons than it's "supposed" to, it's called an "ion". Since ions have the "wrong" number of electrons, they really want to get back to the "right" number. If an atom has too many electrons we say it has a "positive charge". If it has too few we say it has a "negative" charge.  You know how magnets have a North and South pole? That's really just nicer words to describe negative and positive charges. Things with opposite charges attract each other because they want to trade electrons and get back to having no charge.  When you rub certain materials against each other, one of them tends to lose electrons to the other. That puts a positive charge on one and a negative charge on the other. Now they attract. We say that either object has "static electricity" because they keep their charge until they touch something.  If a thing has a strong enough charge and you move it close to your wall, it sticks because even though the wall has atoms with electrons that are "right", the charged object pulls on those atoms and tries to take their electrons away. Eventually it succeeds and the difference in charge between your wall and the object lessens, so the object falls off the wall. This doesn't permanently charge your wall because the wall is BIG and also connected to the ground. If the wall has a charge, it pushes or pulls electrons from the ground until it doesn't. You'd have to have a magic, floating house for it to accumulate and keep a static charge! (Or your house would have to be built specifically to prevent electrical charges from reaching the ground, but this is very dangerous.)
So you and the car are moving at the same speed. The car then suddenly decelerates. You try to keep moving and end up being stopped from going through the windshield with your seat belt. When the seat belt stops you all of the tissues of your body rush forward, around the seat belt when possible. All of these stretchy soft tissues of your body have now been stretched. All that kinetic energy is turned into potential energy in the stretched tissues. Like a spring they recoil. That potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy but the arrow is pointed in the opposite direction back towards the driver's seat.  For a bonus, secondary impacts can also drive the car forward again if it's not a single car against obstruction kind of crash . But simply put, you bounce off your seat belt or the dashboard just like anything else bounces. The whole point of the seat belt is to give you a much larger surface area than the face and knee caps, against which to bounce. Seat belts also have a little more give in them than a nice hard steering wheel of yesteryear so they can soften the impact a little bit. EDIT :: I forgot about the secondary effect. Depending on how the crash takes place the nose of the car may dip as back end rises. As the car tilts up A lot of the crash energy may be converted from kinetic to potential energy as the weight of the car is levered up on the front obstruction. When the rear end goes back down the net leverage is to shove your body like The seat belt is a tiny little trebuchet. So the movement of the car up and then back down again can actually catch you and throw you back where you came from... Which is into the seat. So it is desperately important that when you sit down in any car with headrests you should lift or lower the headrest so that the center of the back of your head is lined up with the center of the headrest when you push back a little. That way there's something to catch your head rather than simply catching your neck and letting your head pivot backwards and stretch your spine and neck.
Imagine hitting middle C on a piano. It produces a soundwave that oscillates at approximately 264 hertz, as well as some other waves that are multiples or fractions of 264 hertz. That means your ear is hearing a wave of air vibrating 264 times per second. Imagine hitting middle C over and over again while someone is speaking. Your brain can tell the difference between the piano note and the person's voice, but your ear is just picking up the vibrations in the air... in other words, it's the software, not the hardware, that your brain uses to distinguish the different sounds that you're hearing at once. All that a speaker has to do is vibrate at the right frequency, which is essentially adding up the waves from each individual instrument in the recording. That will make your ear vibrate at the right frequency, and your brain can figure out what parts of the sound are the drums, the bass, the guitar, the vocals...
Noise is air vibrations. Vibrations take energy.  Think of solid matter as points connected by springs. The stiffer the spring, the more energy it takes to deform. But those "springs" will also release more energy when allowed to return to normal. Therefore, a stiffer material will create more noise because it is releasing more energy into the air as vibrations.
>But... this should only push the car forwards. Where is it getting the force thats pushing it sideways from? They *are* pushing the car "forwards." But, because the front wheels are turned, what constitutes "forwards" is always changing. Basically, the back wheels are moving fast enough, and the front wheels are turned sharp enough, that the there is basically a "lag" between the back wheels wanting to go where the front wheels are pointed. So the back wheels push the back of the car forward, but the front wheels move the front of the car in a different direction, meaning the back of the car is now moving around that pivot point.
> so I've heard that the universe (or everything in it) moves at the speed of light by default This is a common misunderstanding of special relativity and its concept of 4-speed. 4-speed is the spacetime equivalent of normal speed (or 3-speed); it tells you how fast something is moving in spacetime (so space *and* time), and has to be the same from the perspective of all inertial observers (the basic thing we want for SR). But the only speed-like thing that is the same for all inertial observers is *c* (the "speed of light," "local speed limit" or "universal invariant speed"), so the 4-speed is going to have to be *c* by definition (the maths works out that way as well). But this doesn't really tell us anything useful. And it isn't *c* in the sense of the 3-speed of light we normally think about, but a 4-speed. It is a subtly different thing. It also isn't just the sum of the 3-speed and time-speed, but is closer to the difference between them. In general there is no such thing as absolute speed (other than *c*). Motion (without acceleration) is always relative to someone else - you can always find a point of view where something is still (for example, from your point of view *you* are always stopped).
We're pretty confident about the history of the universe back until about a picosecond after what is commonly referred to as the big bang - that's 0.000000000001 seconds (more or less).  Before that point in time, the entire universe was about a million billion billion times smaller than the size of a single atom.  At this scale, our understanding of general relativity (the rules that seem to dictate how the universe as a whole and the big things in it act) comes into direct and unavoidable conflict with our understanding of quantum mechanics (the rules that seem to dictate how very, very small things act).  We know that neither is correct when applied to densities of stuff (matter and energy) that comprise the entire universe stuffed down into a size smaller than nearly anything we can imagine.  In a certain sense, the math just doesn't work - we end up "dividing by zero" in both a literal and metaphorical sense, and our math doesn't permit that.
Tesla coils are a kind of circuit designed to generate very strong radio frequency signals. The result is high voltages in the nearby air, which can cause some gases with low ionization energies to become a plasma (where their electrons are ripped free), and when the electrons fall back down they glow.
The sharper, more chaotic, and more violent sounds are the rounds impacting the target. The mechanical and consistent "brrrrt" sound is the actual sound of the weapon firing. You hear them as separate events because the bullets are traveling much faster than the speed of sound. Of note, you get similar effects from rotary weapons on [other aircraft;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjYz_pY7-Ms) it's not unique to the A-10 and the GAU-8. The A-10 is just more widely known and more recognizable because the GAU-8 is larger and louder, and is almost exclusively used for ground attack, particularly across the Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq wars where a lot of this footage originates from.
Interaction is a very broad term. When two particles interact it means they have an effect on each other, there are lots of different ways this can happen but perhaps the simplest is that of two particles with the same charge repelling each other.  When two electrons exist near each other they repel, this interaction is due to the electromagnetic force. When an electron and a proton are near each other their interaction is attractive rather than repulsive as they have opposite charges.  There are also more complex interactions where particles are converted into different types, when an electron and a positron (antimatter counterpart of an electron) interact they annihilate and two photons are released. Similarly two photons can interact to generate a positron and electron.
It's basically just like... light.  You know how light gets redder as the wavelength increases?  If you keep going, eventually you get radio waves. We just can't see it at that point.
There’s a subtlety here, particles of EM radiation (photons) aren’t physically vibrating up and down. EM waves are just that, waves in the electromagnetic field. They might induce vibrations but they themselves don’t oscillate up and down.  For mechanical wave motion like sound passing through a solid it comes about from interactions with neighbouring particles. Think about atoms in a material as a long string of particles connected by springs (representing inter particle forces), if you displace one of these particles upwards and let it go then it will be pulled back in line by these forces from neighbouring particles. Newton’s third law tells us that every force has an equal reaction, the neighbouring particles get displaced up as they pull the original one down. Now you have more particles which are displaced up, they get pulled back down by their neighbours which get pulled up and so on. The original displacement travels along the material as a wave of up and down movement.
We're tracking literally millions of orbiting objects ranging from tiny shrapnel to massive defunct satellites.  The ISS station has something called whipple shielding. It kinda looks like your video card's heatsink. Lots of thin little ridges. Space debris is moving so fast that it normally breaks up on impact, often even turning into molten material or even plasma. Whipple shielding's initial layer is very thin and it won't stop an impact by itself. But it will cause debris to break up on that initial impact. This causes the resulting hit to be spread out over a much larger area which the whipple shielding can protect against. At the same time, the fact that we track so much debris also means the station often just moves out of the way. If there's even a 1 in 10.000 chance of an impact, they just move the station slightly so the tracked debris flies by. And occasionally they just get hit. Earlier this year debris hit and damaged the robot arm hanging off the station for instance and it took a space walk to fix it. [Kurzgesagt has a nice video on just how problematic orbital debris is in the long run.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS1ibDImAYU)
A principle known as induction. The wireless charger contains a coil. When electricity passes through this coil it creates an electromagnetic field. A special device inside your phone called a rectifier interacts with the electromagnetic field and converts it into electricity that is then used to charge the battery. The conversion comes with a bit of loss due to heat, around 90% - 92% efficient compared to wired charging, and it's slower.
It definitely can be done.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor The problem is to get more energy out than you put in, after allowing for losses from radiation, ions hitting something, etc., so you can have a sustainable reaction. (And, beyond that, to get enough salable energy out to *pay* for everything you put in.)
Objects on the Planck scale already break "conventional physics". So if you had a photon with a wavelength on that scale, you'd break the physics too. People are working on ways of rectifying that issue. It's honestly not a huge deal that something can "break conventional physics". Things have done that in the past, and we've gotten through them. All it means is that our models are incomplete in some way.
You can't receive useful information faster than light, for the simple reason trying to decipher it will erase it. If you detect a righty particle, you will know the entangled twin is lefty, but no one else will know unless you tell them about the righty one. If a friend attempted to measure the entangled lefty twin, the entanglement would break and the result would be scrambled. The friend would have to ask you if they got it right. Which takes us right back at the speed of light again. Measurement and interference breaks entanglement. In quantum mechanics we say it undergoes decoherence. It means the particle becomes part of the quantum system that measured it. EliannaRys' answer is probably better.
It's easier that way. We would have to change a bunch of equations and spawn a lot of confusion. For instance, do we reverse the direction of magnetic fields, too? Or do we make a bunch of our equations negative? Do we just flip the charge of electrons and call it positive? And why? Nobody who actually needs to know the difference gets this confused, and for most people it really doesn't matter.
Color temperatures go red->orange->yellow->white->blue. It could become blue hot if you mad it much much hotter. But in practice you can't make iron hot enough to be blue hot. 6500 K is "standard white" (color of sunlight). You'd need to make it around 8000 K hot to be blue.   Iron **boils** at around 3000 K.   Even tungsten boils at around 5700 K.   So any metal you could be heating up would boil away before it became blue hot.
Why not ask her and let her explain them to you on your date?
That doesn't exist. Something does just not travel "with an amount of force". You can accelerate something with a certain amount of force for some time, and it will have a set velocity afterwards. But the mass of the object and the acceleration time also play a role.
Everything is constantly reflecting light that falls on it, in all directions. The thing about mirrors is that they reflect light at the same angle it came in without jumbling it up. For example if you have light coming in perpendicular to the mirror face then it will reflect perpendicular as well. If it is coming in at a 45 degree angle then it will bounce off at a 45 degree angle. This is always happening; the mirror isn't changing as you shift your angle, you are just moving into a position where you can see what it was always reflecting.
Well, we have helicopters, airplanes, rocket ships... Our best understanding of gravity is that it's just a fundamental property of anything that has mass. Imagine four people are holding a sheet, at all four corners. The sheet is perfectly level, and you can roll a marble from one end to the other in basically a straight line. Now, toss an orange into the center. It sags down under the weight of the orange. Now when you try to roll a marble from one end to the other, it falls towards the orange. Gravity is like that, but in three dimensions. Anything that has mass "bends" spacetime towards it, so that anything traveling nearby is pulled off course, or possibly towards it. Gravity isn't a "thing" or a "force" as much as it is a property of the universe.
It has to do with the amount of "advantage" the lever and winch give you. Levers and pulleys let you move heavy things by transforming a weak but large movement into a small but strong movement. When you use the come-along/winch, your arm will move the end of a long lever by one meter, and transform that into pulling a heavy load a centimeter. By turning a one meter movement into a centimeter movement (dividing the distance by 100), you are multiplying the strength by 100. So if you can exert enough force by hand to lift 50 kg, with the come-along you can lift 5000 kg. When you are using a ratchet strap to strap down a load, the lever you are moving is much smaller, so it moves a smaller distance. So, if the end of the lever moves 10 cm and that tightens the strap by 1 cm, it's multiplying your strength by 10. So, your strength of 50 kg gets transformed into a strength that can lift 500 kg. So, once the strap is so tight it's like 500 kg is pulling on it, your 50 kg strength isn't enough to tighten it any further. So basically, a come-along has a longer lever to give you more advantage.
The simple answer is "because it passes infinitely many points in any positive amount of time". It may help to remember that the *time* it takes to move contains infinitely many moments in the same way that the unit distance contains infinitely many points.
The air inside the car \*is\* still at 25 degrees. However, it's moving very fast with the window open, and moving air that is cooler than your body temperature feels as if it's colder than stationary air does--this is the "wind chill factor" you might have heard on weather reports occasionally. This is the same reason a fan blowing on you feels cooler even though the air it's moving is exactly the same temperature as the rest of the room.
It can't.  That's not true at all.  There are plenty of times when it is not visible when it is night where you are because the world isn't flat.
An absolute vacuum has no matter at all in it. It is literally a void, or void of matter. Space on the other hand is the space outside of a planets atmosphere and has helium from the sun's solar wind, spacecraft, asteroids, comets, and all sorts of other interesting things a vacuum by definition cant have.
Pushing the bulbous part does NOT create a vacuum, no. It just pushed the air in the balloon towards the end of the pipette. If you release your fingers and the balloon wants to return to it's initial round form (we come to that later on again), then the fluid at the entrance gets pushed in. The atmosphere that is in contact with the fluid pushes the fluid into the pipette. It does this because the balloon has some tension in its surface, and it wants to be round and flat, and not squeezed together. So as it opens up, the additional volume created within the balloon is filled due to the pressure from the outside atmosphere pushing onto the surface of the fluid, which in turn gets pushed into the pipette Awesome question, BTW!
This is known as cavitation. As a bullet travels through water, or a blade spins quickly through water, they create pockets of low pressure behind them. If the pressure is low enough then the water turns from liquid to gas, and this is the source of the bubbles. The bubbles are composed of water vapor.
Hearing scientist here, with a PhD in sound localisation. Electronic beeps are usually very clean sine waves, like the stereotypical wave.  They are often high pitched. One of the ways we would out where a round comes from is by the difference in arrival time between the two ears.  The sound arrives sooner at the nearer ear.  But this only really works for complicated sounds with lots of different frequencies (pitches) or lower sounds.  Why?  Well for higher sounds, the wavelength is close to the size of the head.  If you miss the start of the sound, it's impossible to tell which ear is ahead and which is behind because each copy of the wave looks the same.  With lower sounds, it's easier because the size of the head sets a limit on how ahead or behind a wave could be.  With more complicated sounds, you can compare the whole complicated signal to work out which ear got the earlier 'copy'. The other main way we work out locations is using the level difference between the two ears.  This works best for higher sounds because lower sounds can bend around the head better and so the levels are more similar. If the sound happens to be in the middle of these two ranges, you can't really use either method to work out where it is.  Even if you *can* use level differences, the head is pretty symmetric.  We can tell left from right, but it's hard to work out front from back or top from bottom.  The way round this is by moving your head.  But if the sounds are short beeps, you've barely got any chance to figure it out before the beep ends.  It makes it tricky for your brain to combine the info from successive beeps. This is the reason that Tesco vans in the UK now use a burst of noise (like static on a radio) instead of a beep when they reverse. Edit: thanks, kind strangers :) happy to be of help.  I guess I'll take this opportunity to tell you to not use cotton buds (Q-tips) unless you want a perforated eardrum, and remember to wear protection.  Ear protection, that is.  Gigs are loud!  Get some decent earplugs.  Noise-induced hearing loss isn't fun, and there's nothing we can do to cure it (...yet)
Having two eyes in front of your face allows you to see from two angles at once, which your brain can convert into depth. There’s a whole bunch of other things happening, but basically you can use the speed and direction to guess where something will be next. Practice is how you hone it and why you’re good at it, but the mechanics are a combination of spatial recognition and predicting new position based on speed and direction.
Those doors are designed to open inward.  With the increased air pressure, it acts as a force to keep the door in place.
Moving electrons make electrical energy  which we use to do work. In DC the electrons move in one direction, in AC they move back and forth. Think of a hand saw trying to cut down a tree. The one repressing DC  can only be pushed, so you need a really, really long blade, to get all the way through the tree. The One representing AC can be pushed AND pulled so you only need a short blade to cut the tree down.
To be very specific:The issue is that *momentum* and *position* can't both be measured *to infinite or arbitrary precision, simultaneously*, which is a principle that comes to us from quantum mechanics. So there's two issues there: * infinite or arbitrary precision * simultaneously Interestingly, it's not literally an issue of "why can't you *know* both".  In other words: It's not that those variables "have" values which are simply unknowable "in practice".  Rather, in the early 20th century, with quantum mechanics, it was shown that those two variables literally can not have simultaneous physical values with infinite or arbitrary precision. And it's not just for momentum & position.  There are [many different combinations of variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_commutation_relation) that behave like that in the quantum mechanical description. You can experiment to build intuition, if you have audio editing software.  If you select pulses or "sinc functions" from the waveform generator menu, you can flip back and forth between the audio waveform and the "Fourier transform" of that same data. If you experiment in that way, you'll see that you can't simultaneously represent a thin pulse in both the audio waveform and the Fourier spectrum. These principles aren't noticed by us in daily life, because the consequences are far too tiny to be measured by things like rulers and speedometers for things like people or cars.
Because much of math was explicitly designed to mimic the behavior of the universe and the universe, for some reason, appears to obey an underlying set of laws that do not change.
We can transfer electrical energy long distances with low losses and reasonably cheap infrastructure. We can also modulate it to send signals. Also we are good at moving backwards and forwards between electricity and other forms of energy. Other common ways of transferring energy: heat, but there are losses when moving long distance; kinetic, but infrastructure to transfer motion over long distances (a series of shafts?) would be massive; chemical, but we aren't good at converting chemical energy directly into motion without going via heat (hydrocarbons and combustion engines) or electricity (batteries and motors, fuel cells).
Because they are very far away.  If you take a stick and hold it at one end and tilt it, you'll see the other end of the stick moves quite a lot, even if you only tilt it a bit, and the longer the stick is, the more the end moves. It's the same with our vision: the further away an object is, the less we have to tilt our head to keep track of it, and because we have to move our head so little to track it it appears quite slow to our brains, because our brains are surprisingly bad at understanding 3 Dimensionsal space
A typical formula used to convert RGB colours to grayscale is: 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B which is in agreement with your experience.  Also, the [human luminous efficiency function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficiency_function) shows less sensitivity at the blue end of the spectrum than at the red, although note that the situation is reversed for the dark-adapted eye (scotopic vision).
Lenses bend light, changing the direction of said light. Light gets shifted when it changes between mediums.  Like how a straw looks disjointed when looking at it in a cup of water. Lenses are used to focus that light into an image. In order to bend the light just right you have to make the edges of the glass curved. The relationship between the edges allows you to magnifying or shrink the perceived image by changing the direction each little bit of light takes.  This let's you focus it. If you made a purely square lens it would be hard to make sure all of the image is in focus at the same time because the curves on the edges of the glass wouldnt be the same all the way around. Film is square/rectangular because it's an easy shape to store.  Not to mention people historically were pretty used to rectangular paintings. You could cut your film negatives into any shape and they would work, but a strip of film is generally most efficient as a long line of squares or rectangles. If you had circular film it would have a bunch of unused gaps in the plastic you're using to hold the film.  Which is wasteful in a device with very little room to spare.
The star is sending light out in all directions, so some photons hit your eyeballs and some land six feet to your left. Stars send out an unimaginable amount of light every second, so much so that it’s still visible despite dispersing out for trillions of miles.
Angular momentum (the amount stuff is spinning around a particular point) is always conserved. In any sink/tub/whatever of water you've got a little bit of random motion and the angular momentum around the drain generally isn't zero. As the water drains it moves closer to the center and the only way to conserve angular momentum is to speed up, like an ice skater pulling their arms in during a spin. That forms a spiral as the water is increasing it's spin while it flows in towards the drain. It's theoretically possible to have it drain straight in but that is statistically nearly impossible.
This often happens with spinning things in videos. This is due to the frame rate of a video and how it compares to the period of rotation of what is being recorded.  For example, if your video takes thirty frames per second and a wheel spins thirty times per second, it means each time a frame is take, the wheel has just completed a complete revolution, making the resulting video appear as if the wheel is not moving at all. If the wheel spins a little bit faster, like 30.1 times per second, each frame of video will have the wheel just a little bit more rotated than the previous, making the wheel appear to be rotating slowly. The wheel can even appear to be rotating backward if it rotates just a bit slower than the frame rate as each frame is taken just before the wheel completes a revolution relative to the previous frame. The same thing applies if the wheel spins 60 times per seconds. It rotates twice between frames, but at the moment the frame is taken, the wheel is in the same orientation as the previous frame.
AM radio only needs a very simple circuit to "demodulate" the audio signal; a rectifier. A poor quality rectifier circuit can sometimes be created quite by accident, such as by having two dissimilar metals in contact, or a metal and a conductive solution. Metal fillings and saliva can do it!      If the radio signal is very strong, it can overcome the lousy efficiency of such a circuit and make things vibrate just like a speaker would.
They are colour temperature not literal temperature.  The colour temperature is obtained using different wavelengths of light.
Trucks are *heavy*. Driving downhill means the brakes need to constantly be slowing down their heavy loads, building up heat in the brakes. Unfortunately brakes become less effective as they get hot, meaning longer periods of braking are required which makes them *more* hot, etc. Overusing brakes can result in the loss of braking ability which would lead to a massive uncontrolled load hurtling down the mountain. A slope and some sand built beside the road is a minor investment to prevent a likely lethal crash.
Depends what you mean by "time and space" and what you mean by "have a beginning" and "an end". "time and space" could be time the human metric and space as in some area or volume. Or it could be spacetime the four dimensional manifold.   "have a beginning" and "have an end" could be a time when a thing does and doesn't exist (*to end*, *to begin*, the verbs), or could be physical or unphysical boundaries on a variable, (**an end**, **a beginning**, the nouns). Time the human metric can't *end* because it's fundamentally a description of how fast certain things happen, and how long it takes them to do the thing however many times. It can't *end* because it isn't a thing, it's an idea. A day is about 7.942×10^(14) periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of a Caesium 133 atom. That won't *end*. It's derived from a rate, not an intrinsic universal property.   It arguably has **an end** when humans stop existing to use the concept, and **a beginning** when the first humans started to measure duration, but that's a bit too philosophical imo. Space, an area or volume, can definitely have **beginnings** and **ends**, and this is the easiest one to wrap your head around. A football pitch has **ends** that are **beginnings** and vice versa, it's just the edge of the area. The observable universe has **an end**/**beginning**, the point at which light has not yet had enough time to reach us, so it is fundamentally impossible for us to see or travel beyond.   A football pitch could *end* and *begin* when it's demolished or torn up and when it's constructed. The observable universe *began*, as in it started to exist when the universe became transparent to the CMB, and could possibly *end* either by ceasing to exist or due to another effect that makes the entire area unobservable. Big black hole gobbling up the Earth would do the trick (if there are aliens, they have a different observable universe). The trickier interpretation is "does spacetime have **and end**/**a beginning**" and "can spacetime *end*/did spacetime *begin*".   Regardless of whether the universe is 'flat', 'open', or 'closed', it is probably spatially boundless. ([See here for a wikipedia article about the Shape of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe)). Basically this means, you can't ever travel to **the end**/**beginning** of the universe either because you'd come back around to where you started, would follow a path on a complex shape that wouldn't necessarily return to itself but only traverses a finite universe, or just keep going forever. The universe isn't temporally boundless though, and this is where really spacetime comes in. Spacetime is bounded by at least (we're pretty sure) the big bang. So you have a four dimensional manifold that has **a beginning** in one direction on one of its dimensions. One of the 'faces' of the boundless 4D cube that is spacetime has a location. Which is also its only face because the other directions are boundless. The 3D analogy is imagine a cube, then extend the cube out forever in the direction of 5 of the 6 faces. You can locate the last face still, but do the other faces even still really exist? That, but the axis you only extended in one direction isn't x, y, or z, it's time.   It gets even trickier though, because spacetime is a manifold that includes time, and it doesn't exist beyond 13.7 billion years ago, you can't talk about 'times before the big bang'. It doesn't actually make sense. The big bang started time. If you identify any time before, then you would immediately no longer be talking about a time before, since time exists for you to specify where(when?) you mean on the manifold, so you can't be talking about before when spacetime existed. Which means **the beginning** of spacetime is also when spacetime *began*, but neither of those things happened at any time that can be defined non-trivially (i.e.: relative to anything except itself). Spacetime began at all spacetime coordinates where the time component is zero, so all across space (which didn't exist yet) at the same time (which wasn't a thing yet). Get it? No? Great. Moving on...   Spacetime *might* have **an end**/might *end*. We dunno yet. There's a few theories you might have heard of; big rip, big crunch, etc. But for the same reason as **the beginning**, to say when it will *end* doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It *ends* at **the end**. Best you could do is predict the duration of the universe according to its own coordinate system, but given spacetime wouldn't exist anymore, there wouldn't be anywhere or anywhen to observe **the end** and measure it. That's not even addressing the fact that time is not a rigid march into oblivion. It proceeds differently for different parts of the universe, so you'd have a basically impossible task just deciding what to measure the total duration with. In summary,    - Time like on a clock: is a metric. Doesn't make sense for it to *begin*/*end*. Arguably has **a beginning** and could have **an end**.    - Space like your back garden. *Began* and may *end* when it started being your garden and if it ever stops being your garden. Has **beginnings**/**endings** but it's just a continuous boundary, not one or the other.  - Spacetime *began* and had **a beginning** in the -ve direction of the temporal dimension. May *end* and have **an end** but we don't know. Nonsensical to try to say 'when' these events happened/were/will be, as you could only refer to them relative to themselves, which is just restating the point. It's a "Where are my keys?" "They're in the same place as your keys." kind of situation.  EDIT: I don't make it abundantly clear in this, but important to note that time is not the same as duration/time taken/time elapsed. Time can be defined with a single number, a duration necessarily requires at least two.
We know quite well what electricity is; it’s the transmission of power via the motion of electric charge. It’s apparent from the context and overall tone of the presentation that the presenter means “Most laypeople have misconceptions about how electricity works.”
Because, as it turns out, the train analogy isn't actually correct; velocities are not actually additive in this manner, it's just that the net error by using addition is inconsequential in most everyday situations. The train analogy is a bit of "common knowledge" that doesn't actually reflect physics. As it turns out; it doesn't matter how fast you're going or what direction you're moving in. Light (in a vacuum) always propagates at **precisely** c, no more, no less. There's an [*extremely* famous experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) that actually proved this to be true. Edit: on the train analogy; say you're on a train (moving X mph) and you fire a gun in the same direction as the train is moving (with a muzzle velocity of Y mph). At the same moment you fire the gun, you pass a person standing on the ground outside the train. Both of you now observe the bullet traveling in the same direction as the train. You observe the bullet to be traveling at Y mph (relative to you), and the outside observer observes you traveling at X mph relative to themselves, but they do *not* see the bullet travel at X+Y mph relative to themselves; instead, the bullets actual speed, relative to that stationary observer, is strictly less than X+Y, regardless of the velocities involved, and the faster and faster all of this occurs, the less and less adding the velocities is permissible and the more error is introduced. At the most extreme case (i.e. the bullet is fired at the speed of light), both you *and* the stationary observer see the bullet travel at precisely the same speed; c.
Because air is pretty light to start with Normal atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi but we'll use 15 for easy math.  If you have a little 20 liter air compressor then the air in the tank normally weighs 25 grams which isn't much.  If you turn on the compressor and bring the tank up to 15 psi (gauge pressure so its atmospheric+15=30 psi absolute) you now have twice as much air in the tank so it will weigh an extra 25 grams.  You're not worried about the 15 pounds that it says on the gauge because that is pushing outwardly inside the tank and only applies to the walls of the tank, not to the force you need to lift it. If you turn the pump up to 150 PSI (pretty high for a home shop) then the tank has 11x as much air in it and weighs an extra 275 grams, not too much. Lets say you get a really good compressor to go with your piddly tank and get it up to 3000 psi.  You now have 200x as much air in the same volume so it weighs an extra 5 kg which is significant.  This is an important considering for scuba tanks where losing weight as you use the air underwater slowly makes you more buoyant.
Splitting one atom isn't dangerous at all, the amount of energy it releases is minuscule. You wouldn't notice it at all, and in fact it would be very difficult to even *detect* if we tried. But the issue with radioactivity and nuclear reactions isn't about splitting one atom, it is about splitting a *bunch* of atoms all at once. When you split a billion billion atoms in a millisecond the amount of energy released is huge, and that is what is dangerous about nuclear reactions.
Do you mean videos of cars on a dyno? Cameras have frame rates, i.e. 30 frames per second, or FPS. So every 1/30th of a second, it takes a picture. These photos get played back quickly, and you have video. Imagine a six-spoked wheel. If it turns 1/6th of a rotation every 1/30th of a second, it'll appear to be not turning. In reality, it is, but the spokes are aligned in the same positions, so there won't be much of a visible change. If it speeds up and rotates a little more than 1/6th of the way every 1/30th of a second, every subsequent shot of the wheel will have the spoke positions slightly advancing. This will make it appear to be moving forwards slowly. Keep speeding up, and the wheel will rotate at just below 2/6ths of a rotation in 1/30th of a second. If it was exactly 2/6ths, it would appear to stand still again, but it's rotating a little slower, so the shots every 1/30th of a second will come short of 2/6ths. This will make it appear to be rotating backwards. Of course, this is just a camera effect. You cannot observe this with your eyes and a steady light. Florescent bulbs will flicker at 50 or 60 Hz, and can basically be a high-speed strobe light, so you can sometimes witness a similar effect with this type of lighting.
They are wrong. There is totally gravity in orbit around the Earth, that's what keeps the Moon going around us and not wandering off into space. In the ISS, and other orbital spacecraft, the ship and its contents are moving so fast that people inside experience microgravity because the Earth pulls on them and the ship and the air inside at all the same rate.  This keeps the whole system in orbit and makes it appear (relative to the walls of the space ship) that the people are floating weightlessly. Weightless ≠ No Gravity Weightless = No Net force holding you to the ship from Gravity
Large venue speakers are designed to be very directional because sound travels so slowly. They want the crowd to only hear the sound from one speaker because the sound from a speaker, say 33 metres farther away will be delayed by a tenth of a second. In a big sports arena the speakers on the far side of the ground will be delayed by a big fraction of a second and that’s very noticeable and muddles up the sound. The trick with low frequency sounds (bass) is that you can’t make directional speakers, at least not of a practical size. The wavelength of bass is so long that you’d need a huge speaker to direct the sound. So you can hear the bass coming from all over the venue and the bass you hear from the far speakers will be delayed very noticeably.
They use thrusters, which are tiny "rocket engines" (sometimes they just puff gas under pressure) on the sides of the ship.  Gravity actually has little to do with it - it's the lack of air that makes aerodynamic surfaces like ailerons and rudders ineffective.
Magnets don't get used up but they can lose their magnetism. Imagine a big magnet as millions of smaller magnets all facing the same direction. If you mess up their allignment the magnet loses its strenght...BUT as soon as you reallign them he regains it. Thats why you can remagnetize steel.
Mirror images aren't flipped vertically *or* horizontally. They're reversed along the front–back axis. Stand facing a mirror and point left/right (horizontally) or up/down (vertically), and you & your reflection will be pointing the same overall direction. Point into the mirror or away from it, and suddenly you and your reflection are pointing opposite directions.
Diameter difference. The entire item must turn the same number of times no matter the size of the two ends. But the fat end will travel farther in the same number of revolutions.
It's not "heavier". If you have any substance in a perfectly sealed container and freeze, melt, evaporate, condense it, etc. it will stay the same weight. Ice is less *dense*, because when it freezes (normal freezing that we are used to - there are other strange forms of water that take place under strange conditions), it forms a crystalline structure that makes it take up more *volume*. Same amount of stuff over higher volume = less density. Density is what makes it float on water.
There is a concept known as the fire triangle. The three legs of the triangle are air/oxygen, heat, and fuel. If any of the elements are missing or not available in large enough amounts, the triangle will "collapse" and the fire will go out. If you have a strong enough breeze, even though the fire's getting plenty of air, the breeze is cooling the fire faster than the fire can generate heat. Fire is only a chemical reaction, and it proceeds at a specific, finite rate, which means that it only produces heat at a specific, finite rate.
Because you have a suspension. When you brake the weight of the vehicle is shifted towards the front and the amount of force is increased on the front wheels. When the weight is released once you come to a stop any remaining energy stored in the springs is released and you get the little bit of jerk. Shock absorbers mitigate this somewhat but you still have something like 2000lbs of weight being placed on them. When you coast you have no weight transfer happening. The car is losing energy purely by friction. The springs don't get charged with energy and you don't get them releasing energy once you come to a stop.
Water absorbs Infrared specifically well, and as our skin is 80% water, we are perfectly adapted to feel Infrared heat
We can capture CO2, we use various methods to create industrial CO2 at high purity.  The problem is the cost associated with this and scaling it up to the quantities needed to make a difference One common way to just capture CO2 is adsorption.  You fill a tank with a special material that'll absorb CO2, then you pump high pressure air into that tank and fill the material up with CO2.  Now release the air, heat the material, and it'll release its CO2 that you can capture to create high purity CO2 for stuff like carbonating beverages.  This works well for making thousands of tons of CO2, unfortunately we release about 35 **Billion** tons of CO2 into the air every year as a result of power generation and industrial process If you capture that CO2 and want to turn it back into O2 and straight carbon then you need to put energy into it.  How much energy?  *At least* as much as was released when it became CO2 in the first place, which means now you're burning fuel and producing CO2 to generate power to capture and reprocess less CO2 than you just made?  This doesn't scale very well Plants do it by capturing millions of square kilometers of sunlight and using that to fuel their reactions.  We could build massive solar arrays (and we're working on it) but its generally easier to instead just plant trees and let them do their thing. Until we get fusion power up, running, and profitable there can be no carbon capture because it all just takes energy from fossil fuel sources to run which negates its impact
Because at the temperatures at which humans live, things glow mostly in the infrared, with that glow scaling up rapidly as things get warmer. If we lived at a higher temperature, the same would be true, but for visible light instead (as you can see by heating up a piece of high-melting-point metal, which starts by glowing dull red and eventually glows brilliant white).
Based on what I see on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_time) it looks like it’s a system in which in order to model the phenomena we need to us imaginary or complex numbers, rather than just the reals, to express time. It sort of like being in debt before there was a formalized system for negative numbers. You very much owe 10 units of something, but the positive whole number system can’t describe it, so using the integer system is needed.
Satellites very rarely, if ever, have lights. What you see is the sun reflecting off their solar panels or metal bodies  They are launched very frequently. For example, spacex sometimes has multiple satellite launches each month.
Cobwebs are spider webs. They are made of spider silk, a protein fiber produced by spiders as a way to trap prey or make a nest. The term cobweb is often used to refer to old, perhaps dusty abandoned webs.
Boiling = when the pressure outside the liquid is the same as the pressure inside the liquid. It can make evaporation happen faster. But evaporation naturally happens even below the boiling point - energy gets absorbed by water, that excites water molecules and the water at the surface breaks away from the rest to become vapor.
It's the basic problem that was encountered by the Manhattan project researchers: you want the bomb to explode, but you also want the fissile material to be compressed together densely so that it has time to get a good chain reaction going. So the problem becomes: how do you compress together a bunch of plutonium into a very dense sphere, at the same time that it is exploding? You actually increase the yield by slowing down explosion and keeping the bomb together for longer. But there's always going to be some amount of plutonium that gets thrown out of the bomb before fissioning completely so the theoretical efficiency is less that %100, unless we suppose sufficiently advanced technology that could hold together to core of the bomb for long enough
Nope. If you go to a supermarket in Estes Park, Co. (Elevation 7,500 ft) chip bags are fully inflated.
It's funny, but "hard" in this sense doesn't mean "indestructible", it just means "hard to scratch", or better yet "cannot be scratched by something less hard". An example might be glass, you can rub glass with a piece of wood and not scratch the glass, but if you throw the wood at the glass you can still shatter it. Wood is "less hard" than the glass, because it doesn't scratch it. Similarly you can scratch glass with a nail, because metal is harder than glass, but you probably won't shatter the glass by just throwing a nail at it. Simply put, hardness doesn't tell you how easy it is to break or destroy the material, just scratchability. Diamonds are so hard you can't scratch with pretty much any other material, but you can still cut or shatter them.
Its kind of a different mechanism: in an old light bulb, the wire heats up, and the heat causes it to create light through what we call “black body radiation”. It basically means the atoms of the wire jiggle very fast, and this motion creates the light we see. For LEDs, light is created using a different mechanism: we use electricity to move electrons across a barrier, and once they are over, they return to their normal state, releasing light. Kind of like pushing a rock over a hill. This is why it’s almost impossible to make wire bulbs with light that isn’t orange/yellow, since it requires insane temperatures that are unsafe for the materials or people around them. With LEDs, since you don’t need to heat up anything, you just need to find the right kind of material with the right “height” of the mountain such that the light is in the color you want.
Always does me as well I reckon its because I drink beer though and I'm pissing away lots of salt and such, body energy being used to warm cold pints of liquid. It flushes the good stuff out and needs replacing, ethanol and methanol poison really
When hitting a wall, pretty much all the energy of the collision is dissipated in the car's internal structures (and that energy is the one causing the actual damage). When two (identical!) cars collide, the total energy is greater, but it is spread evenly between two sets of identical structures. Of course, this will change if the cars are not identical :)
The more mass an object has, the more it warps spacetime around it. [Here is a visual](https://www.quora.com/If-gravity-is-caused-by-space-time-warping-what-determines-the-strength-and-direction-of-acceleration) to highlight this phenomena
I assume you refer to magnetic flux density.  For example the Earths magnetic field is large in the sense that it covers the entire planet but the magnetic flux density is small so that all iron objects are not permanently pointed north. For just a uniform magnetic field, the unit for magnetic flux density is gauss or Tesla.  1 Tesla = 10000 gauss.  It's hard to describe how strong that field is since it depends on the size and shape of a reference magnet but if your fridge was somehow emanating a 1Tesla field, a 1cm fridge magnet may require 2 or 3 pounds to pull off. For a metal permanent magnet with a distinct north and south pole, the strength is described by its magnetic moment, and the unit is emu per gram.
In general, things keep moving in a straight line unless you mess with them. A pendulum moves back and forward. Nice and simple process; you lift it up to one side, let it go and the pendulum swings in a straight line, and will keep doing that forever (ignoring friction). Now imagine putting a pendulum (with some kind of frame) on a rotating platform, like a microwave turntable (*do not do this at home!*). If the pendulum is hanging freely there will be nothing to turn it - [the pendulum will keep swinging back and forth as the turntable rotates beneath it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Foucault-rotz.gif). So what Foucault did in 1851 was [hang a giant pendulum from the dome of the Panthéon in Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Panth%C3%A9on_Pendule_de_Foucault2.JPG) (it was removed shortly after but temporarily restored in the 1990s). Over time the pendulum appeared to rotate. But pendulums shouldn't rotate. So if the pendulum isn't rotating, the rest of the Earth must be rotating underneath it, with the pendulum staying still! And this all happens in a regular, predictable way, so you can [use these pendulums as clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Foucault_pendulum_1.webm) by looking at how it appears to be rotating.
If you heat up your house with electricity that power resistive radiators the heating up the house with appliances have the same cost. If your heating is system is different, that include an electric-powered heat pump then it is less cost-efficient to heat up your house with appliances. I assume that any other heat source is more cost-efficient than electricity.  From an environmental perspective, it is a question of how your electricity is generated compared to other heating sources. Even if you heat up with electricity using heat pump will be better for the enivorment
Beer is a carbonated beverage. That means there is CO2 dissolved into the liquid well beyond its normal capacity to hold it. The CO2 will slowly escape until it reaches an equilibrium, but under normal conditions, this doesn't all happen at once. When you smack the bottle down, the bottle moves down very quickly. However, the liquid inside doesn't. This creates a vacuum under the liquid. This vacuum allows the CO2 in the bottle to dissolve out very quickly, helping to fill that vacuum. Then, as the liquid actually drops down, the CO2 will form a lot of bubbles, since it will essentially form clumps of gas in the liquid. This creates the rapid foaming. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMb6GNYPqXA This video explores the bar trick of breaking the bottle by doing the same thing but with water in it, and they take a tangent on the beer-filled bottle.
> If the squealing sound only occurs during the use of hot water, the issue is probably associated only with your hot water pipes or faucet parts. Either the stem valve or washer on the hot water side is loose, or something is lodged inside of the hot water pipe. > Another possibility is pipe stretch. When the hot water enters the pipes, it causes expansion due to the temperature increase, and metal pipes stretch against their brackets, which causes a short squealing sound to occur. Replacing your pipe brackets and supports or pipes is the only way to resolve this issue.

simplified version: Electricity flowing through a wire causes a magnetic field. But it works the other way was well. A moving magnetic field can generate electricity in a wire. A big solar storm is a big knot of material that is electrically charged and moving quite fast by human standards. So there is a whirling mass of very powerful magnetic fields in that knot as well. Some times these storms manage to detach from the Sun and come flying our way. Our planet has its own magnetic field which make something called the Van Allen belt. This belt usually protects us from electrical, magnetic and radiation energy from the Sun. If the storm is powerful enough, it overwhelms the Van Allen belt and reaches Earth's surface. When that happens, every wire on the planet converts some of that energy into surplus electricity in the wire. The more powerful the storm, the more surplus electricity is created.  Most devices can't handle that extra electricity. Computer chips are very fragile in that sense, it is easy to burn out bits of it with too much power. Our electricity distribution grid has thousands of miles of wire, perfect for collecting a LOT of that solar energy. That can lead to blown transformers, damaged generators and so on.
The flowers will dry out over time. Moisture in a flower is what gives it its flexibility… over time the moisture evaporates and you are left with the rigid, fragile fibers of the flower. Flattened in a book, it will dry flat and stay that way.
When high pressure air, or any air for that matter, expands, its pressure and temperature drop. Any water vapor present in the air will condense once the air cools enough. This is the same process that causes clouds to form as well.
I'm going to answer with an analogy with boats. On a flat se~~e~~a, the boat move in a straight line. But if you add waves, the boat will move a bit up and down or left and right. Well, a plane does not move on the see but in the air. In fact, it "rests" on air thanks to the lift provided by the wings. If the air is still, the plane will fly flat. But if the air moves in "wave" (in fact, imagine the roll of the wave : that's what a turbulence is), the plane will bounce a bit. But a turbulence is not dangerous to aircrafts : they are designed to sustain turbulences way more powerfull that they will encounter. But, if you are standing in the plane while it get bounced, you may fall and injure yourself. So that's why you are asked to remain seated and to fasten your seatbelt !
Entropy is a thermodynamic quantity that measures the degree of disorder or randomness of a physical system. Is a thermodynamic quantity associated with the irreversibility of states in a physical system. It's like if you had a jar full of little balls, if you throw them on the ground, they will have a big level of "clutter" because that's the "way the universe goes", always increasing this "clutter". If you want these little balls to be rearranged you will have to give energy to the system (decrease the clutter level). In other words, to work in the opposite way of entropy, you have to give energy, otherwise the universe tends to mess everything up.
They normally have Velcro so that objects can be slapped on them and stay in place rather than float around and damage machinery or people.
One theory, that I was told, is that mentally handicapped might not have the brain signal that tells the muscles "STOP, MORE WILL HURT YOU". The other theory is that their adrenalin glands fire even when they're not supposed to. Both can explain the phenomenon.
Imagine two variables, pressure and temperature. The higher temperature, the more likely it is for you to have a gas at a given pressure. However, the higher pressure you have, the more likely it is for it to compress into a liquid/supercritical fluid, regardless of the temperature of the hydrogen. In the core of Jupiter, the temperature and pressure are at a point where you do have liquid hydrogen.  The main thing you have wrong is that you assume that all liquids have less energy than gasses. It is very possible for a liquid at high temperature and pressure to have more energy than a gas at a lower temperature and pressure.
In a system with no external forces (say, you're just holding your rod still and the fish is pulling the line under its own weight), the tension in the string is equal to the force the fish is pulling with. The drag setting can be adjusted to allow line out if the tension in the string is above a certain setting. In practice, tension in the string will be a bit higher because you will also be pulling the rod back/reeling it in. The tension in the string then is how hard you are pulling back plus how much the fish is pulling away. That's also why its so easy to snap your line if your drag is set too high; the reel will never let the line out and the sum of those forces will overcome the tension the line can withstand. Some extra tension stuff: That's all assuming the string is massless (which is kind of fine for fishing line), meaning tension is uniform throughout the string. In practice, if a rope or string has non-negligible mass the tension will vary based on the mass and how gravity is interacting with it. For example, if you had a hanging rope holding a weight at the end, tension at the end of the rope would just be equal to the weight at the end. In the middle, tension is the lower half the rope + the weight. At the top, its the weight of the rope and the weight in total. If that's accelerating, then there's even more tension added in. It gets even messier when the mass isn't uniformly distributed.
Several things * The chemical bonds between the atoms and/or molecules in the substance need to release energy when they are broken. Some types of bonds require you to *add* energy to break them, which is usually unhelpful in burning. * The atoms or molecules in the substance should include one or more that want to combine with oxygen. Almost all burning you see is *something* in the process of combining with atmospheric oxygen. * There should be enough surface area for enough of the substance to interact with enough oxygen. You can see this in dusts that are flammable even when the typical solid substance isn't, such as metals. * Warmth also helps. Many substances become less flammable in very cold conditions. This is a problem for a lot of fuels, and additives to improve burning are common in colder areas.
Photons have no *rest* mass. That doesn't mean they don't have mass(-energy) in a relativistic sense. In relativity, mass and energy are two forms of the same thing (hereafter I'm going to use "energy" for simplicity, but "energy" in that sense is what creates gravity in relativity). You may be familiar with the equation E = mc^(2), but that's actually only for a particle at rest (which protons, of course, never are). The full formula is E^2 = (mc^(2))^2 + (pc)^(2), where *m* is the rest mass (if any), *c* is the speed of light, and *p* is the momentum. For a photon, the rest mass *m* is 0. But photons *do* have momentum (given by p = (planck's constant)/(wavelength)). And so the energy (and therefore, in a relativistic sense, mass) of a photon is not zero, and it interacts with gravity the same way everything else does. Or, if you prefer, the energy of a photon is of course not zero, and because energy and mass (in a gravitational sense) are equivalent, its gravitational "mass" is also not zero. In particular, you're about to get a lot of "because gravity is just curved space" responses that aren't telling the whole story. Photons don't just *feel* gravitational fields, they *generate* them themselves. That said, in practice, the mass-energy of a photon is so tiny as to be effectively negligible relative to just about any particle with rest mass: a photon of visible light, for example, has energy ~4 x 10^-19 J, while an electron has rest mass-energy of about 8 x 10^-14 J (that is, about 200,000 times larger). (In fact it gets worse, because mass-energy actually *isn't* the only thing that generates gravitational fields in relativity. The ultimate source of gravitational fields, the [stress-energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor), is also affected by the *movement* of mass-energy.)
Yes, usually it’s easiest to think of potential energy as displacement.  There is some physical displacement from a more stable configuration that is “holding” energy until it is released. Imagine a spring that you have compressed.  The metal atoms in the spring are contorted out of their preferred alignment and are experiencing electromagnetic stress trying to return them to to the correct and most stable configuration. Now imagine a bowling ball that you’ve carried to the top of Mount Everest.  It has been displaced by several thousand meters, pushed “higher” in the Earth’s gravitational well.  Toss it off the edge and it will immediately begin converting that energy to kinetic energy.  Set it down and electromagnetic repulsion in the rocks will resist this, but the potential to fall eventually still exists.
Your friend is either naive or intellectually dishonest, probably both. He thinks his ability to reason is more powerful than observed reality, and that's patently false. There are multiple infinities (see Georg Cantor and Set Theory), and the important facet here is that they can be categorized as either convergent or divergent. Cauchy provided us with a formula for determining whether a series converges or diverges. In conclusion: an infinite series can converge on a finite number. To trivialize this as "merely a theory" is overly reductive, that no mathematician or physicist would make of their entire respective fields.
The people who are saying here that we didn't understand it are 100% wrong. The people who made and tested nuclear weapons from the 1940s through the 1960s knew they would create toxic byproducts and that these toxic byproducts, if released in the air, would eventually find their ways into the ecosystem and food cycle and human bodies. They knew this from even before they tested the first bombs; it is an inevitable conclusion when you look at how nuclear bombs work (if they are splitting atoms, they are creating very radioactive byproducts, by definition).  So why did they do it? Because: a) They concluded, without a lot of evidence, that as long as they tested them a significant distance from people, by the time the radioactive toxins got into people's food supply they would be diluted enough to not be a measurable amount of harm. That does not mean that there was not harm. It just means that the level of harm was small enough that you couldn't really prove it, which for them was the same as saying there wasn't any harm to worry about. (One can agree or disagree with this. If you know something you do is statistically likely to kill thousands of people in the future, but you don't know who those people will be and no one will ever be able to prove that those deaths came from your actions, does that make you a murderer, or not? This is a much deeper question than it may at first appear, because we do _plenty_ of things today that we know are going to have negative impacts on people, but we are so removed from their direct consequences that we do not feel responsible, generally speaking.) There was _uncertainty_ about _exactly_ how toxic this kind of thing would be — in the face of that uncertainty, the people in charge of testing nuclear weapons tended to assume it _wouldn't be that bad_, whereas you or I might conclude, in hindsight, that there are other ways one could deal with that kind of uncertainty (e.g., assuming it might be bad until proven wrong).  b) They also concluded that the dangers of not having good knowledge of nuclear weapons was more dangerous than the dangers of the hazards from these kinds of tests. If your options are, "test lots of nuclear weapons" or "have nuclear war," then the harm from the former is probably less than the latter. That is how the people making nuclear weapons saw the options during the early Cold War, rightly or wrongly. (Not everyone else saw things in the same terms.) Both of these added up to the people in charge feeling like it was better to test, even if there were toxic outcomes, than not to test. Over time, not everybody agreed with this logic...! By the early 1960s, the amount of radiation in the atmosphere, and human bodies, from nuclear testing was enough that you could easily measure it (that does not mean that you could easily measure the health consequences — it is very easy to measure tiny amounts of radiation, it is much harder to prove that tiny amounts are dangerous). This raised enough concern that the US and Soviet Union, the two nations responsible for most nuclear tests, agreed to a treaty that meant they would only test nuclear weapons underground. This does not release radioactive toxins if done correctly. Some countries still tested in the atmosphere for a few years (France and China), because testing underground puts limits on how big your tests can be (it is hard to test very large nukes underground because that requires you to do extremely deep holes to test them in). But eventually they signed on as well. We now know, from careful studies in the years since the 1960s, that the atmospheric testing before that period affected the health of people living directly downwind of the tests ("downwinders"), and probably increased the cancer rate by a small amount of people living in the entire hemisphere of the test, but even a very tiny increase in the rate over a very large number of people adds up to large numbers (tens or hundreds of thousands of fatal cancers). Even establishing the link between the cancers of the downwinders and the specific tests is difficult to do epidemiologically; cancers don't come with a label that says what caused them, and lots of things can cause cancers, but if you look at groups of people you can compare their cancer rates to the general population and see a spike. It is very hard to establish the larger cancer possibilities of people living in the hemisphere, because even though it might be a large raw number of extra cancers (say, 100,000 or so over the entire 20th century), that is out of many millions of cancers caused for other reasons every year. So that is more theoretical.
Air pressure.  It's just wind really. When air pressure is low outside and it's high inside, the air rushes out of the window, because your door is open and the air is moving through a short gap so quickly (the gap between your window and the frame) it pulls air quickly, and since your door is open, the air from outside the room gets pulled along too, bringing your door with it. Then the pressure equalises a bit so your door closes. Rinse and repeat. I get it all the time when I leave my window and don't shut my door properly.
You'd travel until the universe died.  There is a bubble round us called the Hubble Volume in which the space right now is expanding away from us faster than light, so you'd never be able to leave it, so even with infinite time, you'd never reach the edge of the universe, if such a thing even exists.  You'd stay within the bounds of what we know as the Observable Universe.
It's not a single point. Gravity in orbit is almost as strong as it is on the ground. But they and the ship they're in are moving together, rather than the ship having to hold them up: if the ship suddenly vanished, the astronauts would continue in essentially the same orbit. Because you don't feel gravity (you instead feel the pressure from the weight you place on objects) this *feels* like weightlessness. As they slow down to drop out of orbit, they'll feel the deceleration of the ship. But except when the engines are firing, they and the ship are still moving together. It's not until they're in the atmosphere, and the ship is decelerating in a way they aren't (because air resistance is slowing the ship, but they're not directly feeling that air resistance), that they'll feel much sustained force. But the ship has to have some upward acceleration before they'll feel something you'd recognize as gravity. For the space shuttle, that would be late in its descent, when the air is thick enough to have its wings provide a significant amount of lift. For a rocket that lands on its own without gliding (not currently used for passenger applications), they'd feel it when the rocket fired its engines to slow down to land.
Answer- Light is energy that has photons but photons are massless particles so they have energy and momentum but no mass. Therefore light doesn’t have mass.
You have the option to have toast or cereal for breakfast, there are 2 alternate realities: - one where you eat toast.  - one where you eat cereal. Each of those realities will now hold its own timeline, which is the things that happen as a result of you eating toast or cereal. (You may drop the bowl when you fill it with milk causing you to have to clean it up which makes you late etc) the alternate timeline holds the past/present/future of each alternate reality, with the alternate reality being more of the ‘present’ result of what had happened in the timeline.
Its built to scale. Ba-dum-tish! Its calculated. Things like steel beams, girders, and structural components are easy to calculate as they have known volumes and densities. Same with any poured concrete. The designers know the dimensions involved and the density of the material. Basic math gives weight. A standard, non-custom material like sheet rock flooring has standard weight per unit area use. Glass for windows is easy to calculate up as well in the same weight per unit of area as well.. You don't need to be super precise in tracking a few ounces or lbs when dealing in thousands of tons.
Most metal-cutting waterjets include an abrasive in the water (basically, sandpaper grit). They’re not so much cutting the metal as sanding it away really quickly. Which is technically just bazillions of tiny cuts happening really fast.  Water jets run at *very* high pressure (think tens of thousands of psi). That, by itself, is higher than the yield strength of many softer materials and the water can cut those by itself by literally pushing material out of the way.
When you accelerate you would be pushed back into your seat, but for the majority of the flight path the spacecraft is not accelerating (that much) so the space craft is "falling" with the astronauts.  The engines are off for the majority of the time.
Three pieces: 1. There's nothing to slow them down, so once they get going they can just coast forever.  A spacecraft like Voyager hasn't had propulsion in decades, but is still rapidly flying away from the solar system. 2. Not all space propulsion systems are based on burning things.  Ultimately for a spacecraft propulsion system to work it needs to eject something with momentum.  To do that takes energy.  Combustion is convenient since you wind up with hot exhaust that has both momentum and energy, so it's a nicely packaged way of getting lots of thrust in space, but there are other systems that are better in other settings.  For example, one may use solar panels to generate electricity, then use that electricity to shoot some Xenon gas at *incredible* velocities.  This winds up being a lot more efficient, and oxygen is never needed. 3. The rockets that do use oxygen bring it along with them.  It's effectively just another fuel--you get one tank for oxygen (typically liquefied for the sake of space) and one tank that contains something like Kerosene or liquefied hydrogen.
Freud believed that each of us has an unconscious mind that is split into three different parts that develop at different times in childhood. The Ego is the part that is meant to mediate between the other two (Superego and Id) to prevent anxiety. It does so by being the voice of reason when it comes to your desires and behaviour - looking at expected consequences and making decisions based on them to find one that is acceptable to all parts of your mind. For example, if you found a wallet full of money, your Id would want to take it all and spend it while your Superego would want you to hand it in to the police - a conflict that could cause anxiety. The Ego would then step in and start asking questions like 'did anyone see me take the wallet' and 'how much money is there' and 'how badly do I need money' and similar questions, pushing your unconscious mind closer to the Id or Superego so you can make a decision. At other times, where the conflict isn't something that can be easily decided, the Ego makes use of other defences to reduce anxiety - things like repressing memories, transferring unacceptable feelings to acceptable targets, or seeing the same unacceptable desires in the people around you. Freud believed that these defence mechanisms could be a valuable glimpse into the workings of the unconscious minds of his patients.
Big metal bird not meant to slam into ground. Soft human inside not designed to withstand such forces.
Throw a rock into a pond.  Watch as the waves travel and eventually disperse as they run out of energy.  Sound is similar, you just can't see it.  Sound wave travel requires energy, and sound just like the water ripples it can't move infinitely through a surface because it runs out of energy as it travels.  Different surfaces suck more energy out of, like yelling into a pillow goes almost nowhere.  Has to do with how dense a surface is as to how quickly it will lose that energy.
We don't hear it but we can "guess" sounds by a lot of factors like composition activity temperature and generate kind of sound that u could hear if you were close to it.
It happens all the time because hydrogen is quite abundant and so is constantly being hit by photons that are flying around in space. The photon hits the hydrogen, excites an electron, the electron then deexcites and emits a photon that we then detect.
Things don't, in and of themselves, get cold when expanded. It turns out that most gases do under the conditions common here on Earth, but that's not a guarantee, and even on Earth it's not universal (hydrogen and helium actually warm when expanded at room temperature). The reasoning behind this cooling is [pretty complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_expansion) and has to do with the attractive and repulsive forces between atoms. Atoms repel one another at close range but attract at long range, so the energy of a gas changes based on how its density puts atoms closer together or further apart. If they're mostly in the repelling range to begin with, expanding the gas converts that repulsion to kinetic energy, and the gas warms. If they're mostly outside of that range, expanding the gas pulls the particles apart, which consumes energy and cools the gas. (For an ideal gas, these attractions and repulsions don't exist, and ideal gases neither heat nor cool when expanded. So this cooling is an example of how real gases aren't quite ideal gases, even though that's a good model under a lot of circumstances.) In practice, under normal conditions here on Earth, gases are mostly outside of the repulsion range, so expanding them cools them down.
Electric drive has no clutch or pop.  It can apply a lot of power with no tire slip.  It's less about the horsepower and more about the uniformity of the power from 0 to max RPM without the need for gears or shifts.
Time is an ability of the universe to be eventual, to change it's state and/or the state of anything it consists of.
Newton's second law says that a force F acting on an object of mass m will produce acceleration a Or, in other words, F = ma If you accept that the force of gravity is given by F = gm, and that force will cause an acceleration of ma, then you're basically saying that ma = gm or just that a = g In other words the mass term drops out and you're left with "gravity makes things accelerate at 9.81 m/s²"
It comes from the matter itself. Remember that E = mc^(2). So basically the mass of both particles is converted into pure energy.
Yes, it’s an enclosed system as long as you’re counting the ship.   The difficult part is radiating away the heat as you can’t use an air cooled radiator. Here’s how they actually do it on ISS: https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1
Nothing can move faster than the speed of light, but space is expanding, and the expansion "speed" of space isn't limited to the speed of light.  In the early moments of the big bang the universe expanded very fast allowing light to reach us because the space between the farthest edges of the observable universe where closer to us when the light left, but are now out further away so the light that is currently being generated there will never reach us.
Navigational officer of a large container vessel company here... Some of these other answers are pure speculation or straight wrong, sorry to say... There are many thing together that help them not just fall off. The most important are loading pattern, ISO container, twist lock and lashing. Loading pattern: we load the heaviest containers in the bottom of the hull and the top one is usually empty for various reasons. (Normally empty normal dry going to Asia and empty reefers going to Europe). Also taking ballast can help to bring down the center of gravity. The center of gravity is our target number and is calculated by advanced software with the information of the weight of the containers etc. The ISO container: Today we mainly sail with 20', 40', and 45' containers. There are some odd sizes out there, mainly 53' US rail and a wider EURO container but don't know much about them. All containers build to ISO standard have there corner cast in specific places and sizes. And a minimum strength. Twist locks: this is where the magic happens. Looking in hull, only 20' are stacked with a stacking cone (or hanging stacker, that can be put on from the pier) before locked with a 40' on the top. On deck, all are inter connected with both the container on top and below with twist locks. Here there different types, mainly a larger bottom base twist lock that also is stronger. All other uses normally manual, semi automatic or automatic twist lock. In the end all though work the same but you usually only have one type on a vessel. And the equipment belongs to the vessel. Lashing: Lashing rods are put in place on most ships in two layers of containers. For the modern megamax ships they usually have 3 layers of lashing applied. For many of the accident that have happened where it have been possible to investigate, either wrong or missing lashing (including any twist lock) or wrongly given weights from the sender making a heavy container on top, it will easier make the stack move and collapse. Maybe not so ELI5, but feel free to ask any follow up questions EDIT: To all of you kind strangers that have given me an award: THANK YOU... Especially the gold one
Technically, we don't, But the prevailing theories are that as an object speeds up, it requires more and more energy to continue accelerating. This is absolutely true on Earth and seems to hold true in vacuums, and the math on it says that in order to reach the speed of light for a massive object, an infinite amount of energy is required. Like most theoretical models that deal in infinities, there is always a chance that we are wrong. However, in the experiments that we have run on tiny particles in accelerators, we have never been able to reach the speed of light. We have gotten close, 99.999999998%, but every step closer requires a *lot* more energy. Based on that assertion, that infinite energy is required, we say that achieving faster than light travel, by means of pure acceleration, is impossible. That said, Star Trek/Futurama style spacetime warping could be possible, where the space in front of the object is compressed, allowing for a ship to accelerate slower than light, but achieve a farther distance, getting around that speed limit.
It's a formalization of "flow in = flow out", specifically in fluid dynamics. Fluid dynamics is notoriously difficult such that even proving a couple properties would win you a million dollar prize. Your friend is right in saying that engineering is hard. He's also a dick who gave the most difficult possible response.
Well, I'm not a physicist, but I know that the air around the puck causes friction, so it wouldn't go on forever.
Speed of fan blades has exceeded the speed at which your eyesight refreshes. So your eyes start processing the image moving either way, because it doesn’t have enough information to stay static with one direction.
It’s not.  Centripetal acceleration is v^2 / r . The force is *lower* the wider your turn is. Edit:  I have been downvoted?  Oh, are you implying a constant *angular* velocity (revolutions per second)? v = r θ v^2 / r = (r θ)^2 / r = r θ^2 So if you are driving a car around a curve, the centripetal force will be lower if you take a wider turn, but if you are on a merry go round, the centripetal force is larger on the outside edge.  The outer parts of the merry go round are moving much faster!
Ok, so “electromotive force” is sort of an outdated concept from back when we didn’t understand electricity, and thought it was some kind of liquid. It was thought to be the force that pushed the liquid through the wires.  Nowadays, we still use electromotive force for talking about circuits, not because it’s actually a force, but just from convention.  Electromotive force is the potential energy that a charged particle would lose from one side of a circuit to the other. It’s also known as Voltage. You measure the electromotive force (which again, isn’t a force), in units of energy per charge, so Volts, Joules/Coulomb, that kind of thing.  (There are some slight differences in implication between emf and voltage, but for most practical purposes, and for an explanation, they’re essentially the same) ___ The electromagnetic force, on the other hand, is the force that pushes magnets apart, or makes balloons pull your hair into the air when you rub them together. It’s the actual force (in Newtons, or Pounds if you don’t use metric for some dumb reason) that acts on magnets and electrically charged particles. Also, the electromagnetic force is what *causes* the electromotive force. A particle moving in the same direction as the electromagnetic force will lose potential energy, which means its voltage is changing. It’s experiencing an electromotive force.  **Edit:** *I incorrectly said that you measured voltage in joules, which is obviously wrong (you measure it in volts). Fixed that.*
Black holes. Neutron stars. They’re both basically massive atomic phenomena. But we don’t know enough about those objects to test what we don’t know. Basically, quantum mechanics is the most well-tested theory we have.
Imagine trying to dye the water in a squirting hose. All the dye you put in would just be the water on the end, the dye would never flow up the moving water. Fire is the same way as that.
If you close the window half way, half the sound energy will come into the soundproof room.  If you have an accurate sound meter, it would show this.  It doesn't seem "half as loud" you say?  Of course not.  Your brain is a completely non-linear processing system.  The whole point of hearing is to pick up the faint sounds that might warn you of danger.  Think of it like automatic gain control, where the amplifier turns up its gain so you can still hear the softer music.
Who is excited? Most people I've talked to think they are wasting the worlds ressources for some random leisure project
The Earth is always falling towards the sun, but it is also moving to the side very very quickly, so it is continuously missing the sun by fling past it to the side. this is how all gravitational orbits work.  If our planet were to lose its sideways momentum instantly, would would simply freefall into the sun, but the fact that we are moving to the side so quickly means we will (almost) never fall to the surface of the sun. [This illustration may help you understand the concept of an orbit, and how it keeps you from hitting the body you're orbiting](https://cdn.ricochet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/freefall.jpg). If you stand on a tall tower and fire a gun, the bullet will go forward, but will be pulled down by gravity and it will hit the Earth. If you fire a more powerful gun, the bullet moves faster, and so it travels further before being pulled down to the Earth. If you fire more and more powerful guns, eventually your bullet will go so fast that it will go around the curvature of the Earth before being pulled down to the surface.  The Earth is that bullet that is going so fast to the side that it is always missing the sun.
Light is made out of a wave in the electromagnetic field. By changing the frequency of the wave you also change the colour. It's the same as with sound, if the frequency increases, sound becomes higher and the colour of light moves towards blue, if the frequency decreases, sound becomes lower and the colour of the light moves towards red. The frequency of a wave motion is the amount of waves that happen per second.
Light rays travel at a fixed speed *in a vacuum*, in something like Earth's atmosphere they are slowed down a bit by interaction with matter. We know the speed of the light in a sort of backwards way. There is a speed limit imposed on reality that stems of Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity, this limit is 299,792,458 meters per second, which is a mouthful so they just call it "c". The problem is nothing with mass can actually reach this speed so c becomes a theoretical maximum speed limit that nothing can travel faster than. Since light has no mass it is capable of reaching c in a vacuum, therefore the speed of light is c. If you multiply c by 3,154,000 seconds (the number of seconds per year) you get a distance in meters which is a super big ugly number so we just shorten it to 1 light year.
Most of the effort on the atomic bomb project was making the fuel for the weapons. It is not normal uranium; you have to use gigantic factories to make it a purified amount of uranium-235, a rare isotope. This cost about 60% of the total labor and money spent on the project, and made enough material for a single bomb.  Yes, the design on the U-235 bomb was very simple. It's a little more difficult than you make it out to be — they wanted to be nearly 100% sure it would work, and that required a lot of research into _exactly_ the conditions that would cause a nuclear explosion, and making sure that their specific design would _exactly_ work as they expected it to. But it was not a complicated design and most of the work during the war was not about that. Because they weren't sure they could make enough U-235 in time to use in the war, they also tried to make another fuel, plutonium-239. This is an artificial element that needs to be created in a nuclear reactor. So they had to invent nuclear reactors and learn how they work, then scale them up large enough to produce enough Pu-239 to be useful. This cost about 20% of the total effort. While they did this, they discovered that Pu-239 cannot be used in a gun-type design like U-235 can; it will start to react too early and predetonate. So they then spent almost all of their time figuring out a much more complicated bomb design, the implosion design, that can work with Pu-239.  To correct a few things — the first weapons were all fission, not fusion. And it isn't slamming together powerfully that makes the reaction work. The reaction happens when these special fuels (called fissile material) are in the right conditions for a chain reaction to take place. They didn't want the fissile material to be in that position before they wanted the bombs to explode. So making a bomb design of this sort is essentially coming up with an engineering device that goes from "not going to react" to "going to react" very fast. So the gun-type bomb is taking two non-reactive amounts of U-235 and putting them together quickly so they react. The implosion bomb is taking a non-reactive amount of Pu-239 and using high explosives to increase its density so it becomes a reactive amount (density, mass, and geometry are three important parts — not the only ones — about what makes a given piece of fissile material react or not).  Anyway — 90% of the work for the Manhattan Project was making the special fuels. Only about 4% of the total expense and labor was involved in designing the bombs, by comparison. If you're asking, "why do we tell it as a story of bomb design, then, and not industrial production of fuels?" — that's largely because we like telling stories about clever scientists more than we like telling stories about the construction of gigantic factories.
The leaf blower is pushing the air into the sail, but there is an equal and opposite force pushing the leaf blower back. So if the leaf blower is attached to the boat the two forces will cancel each other out and you won’t move. Of course this does mean if the leaf blower isn’t attached to the boat (eg it’s being held by a guy on shore) it will work. A hot air balloon doesn’t blow air to generate a force, it uses a flame to heat up air instead. The hot air then naturally spreads out, becoming less dense, and will generate a buoyancy force on the balloon.
Wind chill and relative humidity are major factors in what the weather "feels" like. The more wind is blowing, the colder the air will feel, as it blows away the air that your body has warmed up, replacing it with cold air. A slight wind may feel brisk and refreshing, while a strong wind will feel much cooler than you expect the air to feel. The higher the relative humidity, the warmer the air feels, as it slows down your ability to sweat. Very wet air will feel cloying and oppressive.
Yes. Let's look at America's missile defense system... In your first line of defense, you have Aegis missile cruisers. These, if tactically and luckily positioned, may get a shot at a launching ballistic missile. Next, you have the developmental Ground Missile Defense (GMD). This is a large missile system that launches an intercept missile that will attempt to hit an incoming reentry vehicle during the sub-orbital phase. Next is the THAAD, an advanced hit to kill weapon system capable of striking a reentry vehicle during its reentry phase. Last us systems like the Patriot missile system. These may have a crack at individual warheads after they've separated, but it's pretty much a crap shoot at that point I think.
Your faucet has an aerator that mixes air bubbles with the water flow. The aerator can only pull and mix air when the water flow is high enough, adding bubbles to the water that scatter light, causing the water coming out to look white. Aerated water doesn't splash as much as pure water, uses less water, feels like a greater water flow.
What you're trying to formulate in words here is known as the ideal gas law: PV = nRT.   It's an idealised law, which means that various factors specific to each gas can skew this slightly. But to stick with ELI5 what this means is that the product of Pressure (P) and Volume (V) always equals the product of the amount of gas (n), the temperature (T) and a specific, fixed constant (R). This equation must always hold.   From this, you can read for example that if you want to increase pressure, there are three things you can do. You can add more gas, increasing n. You can add more temperature, increasing T. Or you can reduce the volume, decreasing V. Each of these can balance your equation so it still holds with your increased pressure. Indeed, as you said, if you want to increase pressure, keep the volume constant, and the amount of gas constant, you must increase temperature.
A dimension is simply a space with some minimum number of coordinates needed to specify an exact point within it. Take a line for example. A line is one dimensional because you only need one set of coordinates to specify a point on it. A flat square, like a piece of paper, is 2 dimensional because you need 2 coordinates to specify a point on it - you need to know how far left or right \*and\* how far up or down. A cube is 3 dimensional because you need to know 3 sets of coordinates: how far left or right, how far up or down, and how far front or back. Time is also a dimension because time in inexorably linked to space, and in order to know where something is, you also need to know where it is in a specific point in time. We know there are at least 3 spatial dimensions because we know we have 3 sets of coordinates we need to specify where something is: the x axis (left or right), the y axis (up or down), and the z axis (front or back). So there can't be fewer than 2 because we see that things have length, width, and height. There could be more, and in fact certain theories suggest that there may be many more "hidden" spatial dimensions that the 3 we observe, however there's no evidence to suggest that they actually exist and certainly no evidence to suggest that there are infinite dimensions, although it's possible to model infinite dimensions mathematically. As for why things like color or temperature are not dimensions, they're just properties of something, they don't tell you the coordinates of anything in a space.
If you’re thinking of sport climbing, someone rappelled down from the top of the cliff after scoping out a potential climbable line. They drilled and placed permanent anchors into the rock. After that, climbers can simply clip in quickdraws (two carabiners connected to a piece of nylon called a dogbone) as a sort of checkpoint system to place their rope into and protect them when they fall.
Metals have "loose" electrons in their outer layers, so they are very conductive, and the smallest voltage or electromagnetism can [get those electrons moving](https://o.quizlet.com/pUNp40EsHjg.unj29LmgPA.jpg), and electrons moving is what electricity is. So the effect where an electromagnetic field causes electricity to happen in all nearby metals is called [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction).  It's why radio works, why you can put an osciallting voltage in an antenna and all metals (antennas) within range will "feel" it (will have a matching oscillating current appear in them), and it's why transformers work. So your pulsar "pulses" electromagnetism, and very strongly.  Electronics is a bunch of chips and electronic components, all connected by metal wires, so your pulsar would cause extremely strong and random electricity in all the wires, thereby frying the chips and electronic components. You don't even need a pulsar; electronic devices are fried by a microwave oven, by being very close to a powerful transmitter radio antenna, by electromagnetic radiation flares from the Sun, etc.
Basically, a moving electric field (i.e., a moving electric charge in a conductor) creates a magnetic field. And a magnetic field would make electric charges in a conductor move. An electric charge always generates an electric field. We usually describe how a single moving charged particle would interact with stationary ones in our frame of reference, this is what allows us to talk about the magnetic field of a "moving" particle. But we could change the frame of reference to whatever else and the effect would remain the same, so its really the relative movement of the two charges that's important.
Water likes to stick to things (that's why it runs down your arm in the shower). Pour spouts are shaped so that the water can't grab on. If it doesn't have a spout, you have to turn the cup almost upside down to prevent it from holding on to the glass (like it does in the shower).
Magnetic bearings are very low friction, but not zero friction.  The moving magnetic field induces eddy currents in surrounding structures.  If you use electromagnets, like mag-lev trains, they need to be superconducting or you lose energy to resistance heating.
Gravity doesn't travel in the form of waves, gravity just is.  Changes in gravity propagate as gravitational waves If you just have a big star sitting still then just like a leaf in a still pond it doesn't generate ripples If you have two big objects orbiting each other then there's increased gravity on the line that runs through both of them and since they're rotating that ends up [creating a spiral of higher gravity](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Wavy.gif) that moves outwards at the speed of light As they get closer and orbit faster the frequency of the gravity waves we would measure increases until they get so close they merge up and become one and the gravitation waves stop forming.  [You can see that in this visualization of two blackholes orbiting and joining](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/8/85/Warped_Space_and_Time_Around_Colliding_Black_Holes_%28Courtesy_Caltech-MIT-LIGO_Laboratory%2C_produced_by_SXS_project%29.webm/Warped_Space_and_Time_Around_Colliding_Black_Holes_%28Courtesy_Caltech-MIT-LIGO_Laboratory%2C_produced_by_SXS_project%29.webm.480p.vp9.webm)  The waves are slow and moderately strong at the beginning but as they get closer they get higher frequency and stronger until the merge occurs People have been trying to find a graviton particle that carries gravity for decades and we're really no closer to it so its unlikely that gravity itself has a wavelength you can measure
General relativity is an applied theory of geometry, which as you know involves studying the properties of shapes and surfaces. The four-dimensional surface used in relativity is called spacetime, the curvature of this surface is used to make real-life predictions about the behaviour of gravity. However, just as your grade school science book about magnets does not imply that magnets shoot tiny arrows, GR does not imply that there is a real-life surface called spacetime on which we live that curves in the presence of mass/energy.   So no, spacetime is not displaced by matter because spacetime does not exist.
Mechanical advantage. While energy is conserved, force is not, so you can apply a small amount of force to the lever over a long distance of motion, and in return the car is moved a small distance by an immense force.
The ability to dissolve solutes basically depends on how quickly and efficiently solvent molecules can surround solute particles. As water, or other solvents, get warmer, their molecules have more energy to move around, so they can surround solute particles faster and more efficiently. It has more to do with particle movement than intermolecular space, as the volume of liquids does not change much with temperature.
ISS is absolutely not sitting still.  Due to relative velocity time dilation, ISS clocks would move more slowly than those on Earth.  There is a difference in clock speed due to gravity in the opposite direction but it’s outweighed by the velocity.
Usually poor traction on the road. The rain floats oil up onto the surface of the road. Then a car slides and hits a pole.  Alternatively if it's windy, a tree or branch could be blown down onto a wire.  The rain itself doesn't cause power outages, damage to the grid does.
It’s nothing. With a tiny bit of gas, some rocks and dust and radiation. You know how the earth’s atmosphere gets rarer and rarer the higher up you go? Well, at some point you just don’t encounter that many molecules of gas; because nothing is replacing that gas, all you get is vacuum.
Let's do the math! * The brightness of a star is proportional to 1/distance^(2).  * The Sun illuminates Earth with a total brightness of about 1.3 kW per square meter. * A dilated healthy pupil has a diameter of about 8 mm. So looking directly at the sun with a dilated pupil would, aside from being very painful, allow about 270 milliwatts of power into your eye. * If the Sun were 10 parsecs away, it would be about as bright as a dim star in the sky. So, to compute the amount of *power* entering the eye from a dim star: 270 mW / (10 parsec / current distance to sun)^2 = 6.4 x 10^-14 W. Then we just need to divide by the average energy of a photon of visible light, or about 4 x 10^-19 J. This gives us a ballpark estimate of about 160,000 photons (per second, since we were measuring energy per second a moment ago).  That's actually quite a long way above the threshold of vision, which can be stimulated by only a hundred or so - the limiting factor to seeing a star in the sky is the background light in the atmosphere, not your raw dark vision. A sealed room is much darker than the night sky. EDIT: Sorry, I was using raw sunlight in space - only about 1 kW/m^2 makes it to the ground. So my number's high by about 30%. But there are probably other sources of error here too.
The Universe is expanding, and it seems this expansion is accelerating.  That's an unexplained phenomenon, attributed to undefined things like "dark energy" or perhaps even "dark matter". These thermal findings are very interesting, as they might indicate another thing dark energy does, and from that somebody in the future might propose a theory which explains accelerating expansion and rising temperature. Until then, the answer's probably worth a Nobel Prize.
Diamonds aren't *particularly* heat resistant, certainly not more than a good steel compound. They start turning into vapor well below 1000°C. For temperature resistance, you usually want *tungsten*.
When your phone drops, the screen protector takes the brunt of the damage. I mean, it’s essentially the same principle as wearing a helmet. Does he believe in helmets?
The act of water transitioning from a liquid to a vapor is not what burns you. The hot water burns you. Boiling water is hot. It burns you. Cool it down a degree so it is no longer boiling and it burns about the same amount. The water that becomes a vapor is not hot. The energy required for a single molecule to leap from water into the air is not enough to damage your body. When water is hot enough that its molecules leap away with such vigor as to displace all surrounding air,  then it is enough to start damaging things.
You're right. An electrically resistive space heater is 100% efficient at the task of turning electricity into heat. (Even the little energy that gets turned into light reflects off of the walls and becomes heat, so it is truly 100% efficient) Small ones might have more trouble moving that heat around a room, but if they give the same power output, they are producing the same amount of heat.
It will run out of fuel, in several billion years. It doesn’t combust like gases you think of as fire on a stovetop, it’s undergoing nuclear fusion turning hydrogen into helium. But that hydrogen is being used up.  You’re just underestimating just how *ridiculously gigantic* the sun is, and how much fuel it still has left.
Very large nuclei tend to be extremely unstable: after their creation by smashing together smaller nuclei they may only persist for a very small fraction of a second before decaying into smaller nuclei
It's dynamically stable. A lean to a side makes the front wheel turn towards that side and sets the bike upright again. Make an experiment. Stand next to a stationary bike and hold it by the seat. Now lean it to sides and observe the handlebars. You will notice the effect immediately. In normal operation the handlebars turn by a tiny angle but that's enough to counter a tiny lean. It's like holding a stick upright on your finger. Whenever the stick starts falling you move your finger "under" the fall to keep it up. The bike does roughly the same when it's moving. When it isn't moving it falls, just like a stick does once you stop moving your hand.
About 200 years ago, Humphrey Davy investigated the basic idea of using electricity to create light. He showed that when electric current flowed through wires, the resistance caused them to heat up and give off light. He simply had a problem finding material that not only burned brightly and lasted many hours, but was also cheap.   About 40 years before Edison created the carbon filament lightbulb (1879), Warren De La Rue solved the scientific challenges by using thin, high resistance filaments to achieve the brightness, and delayed burnout by making the bulbs out of high melting point metal sealed in a vacuum. However, he used expensive platinum for the filament, and the problems with creating a reliable vacuum made the process too expensive for common use.   In 1878, Joseph Swan publicly demonstrated the first light based on carbon. The problem he faced was his use of thick filaments, which led to rapid burnout.   Eddison was the first to use thin carbon filament with a better designed vacuum. Which is probably why he gets credited with creating the lightbulb.   When Westinghouse won the bid to illuminate the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, they were unable to use Edison's patented design (the screw design), so Telsa made a new lightbulb base with a pair of nipples that twisted into place.
As you say when there is no load connected it is very easy to spin. This means you are doing very little work to turn it, so there is very little energy that needs to go anywhere. What little energy you do input is going to friction in the bearings, maybe a little joule heating from eddy currents.
There is resistance. And the lines do lose power. By using big cables and higher voltage (lower current for the same power), they can lose less power in the lines, but it's still a significant amount- about 5% of power generated in the US is lost in the transmission lines. That's why we have power plants all over the place instead of powering the world from a giant solar farm in the desert.
We're always looking back in time.  Light travels at 300 million meters a second.  This is a ridiculously quick speed.  But it's not instantaneous!  It still takes time. If you stand a meter and a half away from a mirror and look at yourself, the light reaching your eye is having to travel three meters to get there.  It goes from your body to the mirror, then back to your eye.  This means it takes about 10 nanoseconds (10 millionths of a second) or 0.00000001s to reach you.  So, you're actually looking at what you looked like 0.00000001s ago.  But, for all normal purposes, we can say this is instantaneous. Space is huge.  It's mind-blowingly huge.  Even at the blistering pace light travels at, it takes a whole 8 minutes for light from the Sun to reach us.  When you look at the Sun (don't do this), you're seeing light that left 8 minutes ago.  If the Sun spontaneously vanished, it'd be 8 minutes before we realised. And that's only the Sun, our own star.  The next star, Proxima Centauri, is so far away that it takes light 4 years to reach us.  So, when we point a telescope at it, or even our eyes, we are seeing light that left it 4 years ago.  We're literally seeing the past universe.  Because of how big the universe is, we invented a new length, the light year.  This is how far light can travel in a year, and it's about 6 million million miles. One of our nearest neighbouring galaxies is the Andromeda galaxy.  This is a whopping 2.5 million light years away.  That means when we point a telescope at it, we see the light that left it 2.5 million years ago, and has been traveling at 300 million meters per second ever since. This is what we mean when we say we're using telescopes to see in to the past.  The light has come so far that it's taken that long to reach us!
Its a process that happen without the object changing temperature, to do it they usually change pressure and volume. Its the law of boyle An example would be a ballon being inflated: it gains pressure and volume but the temperature remains the same.
How do you think all pieces are coming towards you? You literally see the  sparks flying in all directions.
a waterfall is just a river with a big drop in it.  They don't run out of water for the same reason rivers don't run out of water - there is sufficient water source upstream (typically snowmelt) to continually supply them.  But like any river, given the right conditions, they can run dry.
Yes the result would be the same. (Except the cool stream of air would "infiltrate", I.E. come through all cracks of your house) And if you have a good HVAC system then there will be both (potentially connected through a heat exchanger to recover heat in winter)
Mirrors actually do not flip reflections at all. Or rather, I suppose that you could argue that they flip front-to-back, since your image faces you, but they do not flip left and right. We *expect* them to flip left to right, since to face us a person would have to turn around (flipping left to right), but when they do not do this it confuses us.
>Does a constant downward motion affect the normal force you're perceiving. For example when you're in a lift after the initial acceleration, I can't tell if I'm feeling my "weight" differently.      Your weight is not affected by your velocity (at whatever speed in whatever direction you're moving), only by acceleration or deceleration (and a couple other things like position within any given gravitational field and buoyancy, but that's not what you were asking, I guess).
Might as well be. Electro magnetism is a force in the universe along side the strong, weak, and gravity. We really don’t know why it works how it does. It just does. Anyone who can develop an answer would undoubtedly get a Nobel prize in physics and stupid amounts of money.
Gravity also pull out other stuff, like air, and they're a lot better at filling the space below the cloud than the cloud. Cloud is heavy, but the air below them - which they would displace if they fall - is even heavier. Unlike a feather, which is small so the amount of air it would displace is small, and the weight of the feather is enough to beat out the amount of air it will displace.
Photons are very special. They have no rest mass, and only exist at a very high speed, and have angular momentum even though they have no mass or width.  They are also their own anti-particle, as antimatter reactions produce photons that are identical to regular matter reaction photons.
I’m guessing you’re talking about shockwaves from explosions? A shockwave is basically a bunch of air molecules bumping into adjacent air molecules which carry the kinetic energy forward; like dominoes, where the person pushing the first domino is the explosion
True Vaccum is subjective term as matter and energy are interchangeable via E=mc2. You cant create a space with zero energy. Space itself has inherited energy in quantum mechanics.
We both measure the same speed; what appears different depending on your speed relative to the source is the frequency...if you're moving towards it, the frequency is shifted higher ("blue shift"), if you're moving away "red shift".  There's no such thing as a truly stationary observer, but I'm assuming you mean stationary \*relative to the source\*. The way that we both see the same speed of light is that time moves differently depending on your relative speed. We have a light source at A, an observer at B that's stationary relative to A, and we're moving towards A (so we have some speed relative to both A and B). Because we're moving relative to B, time moves more slowly for us than for B. When the math dust all settles, we measure exactly the same speed for light.
Yes,  if the resistance stays constant; increasing the voltage will pull more current. V/R=A  *V- volts,  R- Resistance (Ohms),  A- Amps (current)*
The first estimates were made by Eratosthenes, in about 240 bce.  Astronomical dates like midsummer and the solstice had been known for thousands of years. What Eratosthenes did was confirmed a rumour of a place where the midsummer sun perfectly illuminated the base of a well (the equator), then on the same date measured the length of shadow cast by a vertical pole at a location that was several hundred km away. By knowing the distance apart, and the fact that one place had vertical sun Ray paths, and the other Ray paths at an angle, he was able to use basic trigonometry to estimate the earth's diameter. His value is within measurement error of the true value.
Nuclear research. It's right there in their name.   They are most famous for creating the World Wide Web (not the internet) and for having the Large Hadron Collider which was used to confirm the existence of the Higgs Boson (the so called God Particle). So............ they do a lot of research.  This ranges from smashing particles together at tremendous speeds and energies to figuring out how to better organise the internet.
Wind is neither hot nor cold in itself, but when it breezes over a surface it creates low air pressure over the surface. Moisture on your skin evaporates faster in lower air pressure, which means that the fast moving molecules in the moisture break free from the liquid first and leave the slower moving molecules behind. All in all this lowers the average temperature of the moisture and thus your skin. Evaporation works even without wind, but with wind it is notably colder, hence why wind feels cold.
Your eyes perceive things which are flickering very fast as constant, if the flicker is below the [flicker fusion threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold) then we can't tell the flashes apart. Cameras on the other hand don't really have this, video tends to have exposure times of around 1/60th of a second which is more than enough to distinguish the flashes.
It's a chemical property, the temperature at wich the substance reacts with air. Though, any chemistry is just a special case of physics. Chemical reactions happen due to physical properties of electrons.
It shoots forward at its normal speed with respect to you. This means that with respect to ground, it's speed is that, plus the speed of the train, since it was already going moving at the speed of the train inside your gun.
Define fan, turbo pumps can take an enclosed space down to   about 10^-13 of an atmosphere.
Some pairs of characteristics of a particle or system cannot be both known with arbitrary precision simultaneously. This is not an engineering problem (i.e., we don't need new technology) or even a physics issue (i.e., we need a better representation of reality). It's more fundamental than that.  The most common example is position and speed of a particle. By definition, speed is how much position changes over time (or over some stretch of space). So if you want to know the speed of something with extreme precision, you will need to know the various positions of something over a short period of time. So when trying to determine speed, you have to include some incertitude on the position since it's changing. On the other hand, if you want to know the precise position, you will need to be exact about what instant in time you're talking about. Essentially unable to specify the speed. Speed is spread out in space and time, position is a point. You can't have both. If we accept some loss of precision, then we can find a trade-off that allows us to talk about both. For example, the particle is in that bit of space and goes to that speed for the time it's in it.  Another example is the position and frequency of a wave. A wave is by definition spread in space. A wave with a simple frequency is infinitely extending and had no position. You can add multiple frequencies together and their interference will produce a wave with a more limited spread. But the more you want precision on the position of the wave, the more frequencies you need to add. So against, you can't be precise about both at the same time.  Every time you end up with this sort of interaction it's an instance of the Heisenberg principle.
Light can be UV and polarized at the same time. They are not two different things, instead, those are labels for two different attributes which some light could have. Light is made of waving electric and magnetic fields, imagine it like the ripples after you drop a rock in a puddle or a waving string with high strength fields where the string is high and fields facing the opposite way where the string is low. In light, this field will wobble up and down as it travels.  The faster the wave goes up and down the higher its frequency is. It is this frequency which determines what colour light is. For example, red light has a lower frequency than blue light and radio waves, which are also a type of light, have a much lower frequency than even red light. So there are frequencies of light which humans cannot see and UV is an example of this. Violet light is the highest frequency which humans can see and UV (or ultra-violet) has a frequency a bit higher than violet, meaning that we just can't see it. So UV light just means that the light has a particular frequency, or speed of wobbling. Since light wobbles you can also talk about what direction it wobbles in, it could wobble up and down, or side to side, or somewhere in-between. The direction in which it is wobbling is called its polarization. Most light, like that from the Sun, is made up of a whole mix of directions which makes it unpolarized. So in contrast to that, when all the light is neatly wobbling in the same direction, it is called polarized light.
If they are narrow notch filter reflectors, you will see no spot on the blue wall.  If they are indoor house paint, you'll see a blue spot on the blue wall.
Sound is caused by vibrations in the air and entering our ears. Those vibrations can also move through a solid object like a wall and still vibrate the air enough for us to hear; you'll notice the difference in pitch from the change in how those vibrations move through the wall.
They don't. They don't even know if it's finite or infinite. The only thing we know is that it's much bigger than the observable one because we have vision on some stars that already left the observable universe and we can estimate their distance to us to be around 4 times the radius of the observable universe (no guarantee for that number, it's from memory)
Conscious observers don't really matter. Measurement is often a misleading word when it comes to quantum mechanics. The more appropriate word would be interaction. We can only measure things by having them interact. In the double slit experiment for example, you cannot set up a detector in one of the slits and detect a photon passing through without having the photon interact with the detector in some way, thereby causing decoherence of the wave.
It depends on how many "free moving" electrons are inside the material. When visible light hits any material, the electrons inside can absorb energy and re-emit it in a different direction.  Metals are shiny and opaque because of they contain free moving electrons that can move and respond to light. Glass on the other hand have electrons that are too tightly bound and light doesn't have the energy to interact with them and just passes through instead.
We don't know. Our current understanding is that _everything_ - all matter, all energy, even _space and time itself_ was created in the Big Bang event. The _how_ and the _why_ are mysteries to science.
We predicted them theoretically long long before we had any evidence they actually exist or could exist. Einstein’s theory of general relativity predicted that if something gets dense enough it will continue to collapse until even light can’t escape. Much later we discovered radio sources which looked like how we expected black holes to look
Any wave’s wavelength and frequency are related to each other by the speed. If two waves of the same length are moving at a different speed, the one that is moving faster is a higher frequency. Speed is distance over time, frequency is number of times the wave cycles per time unit, and wavelength is a distance.  Wavelength * frequency = speed The speed of the wave is fixed for electromagnetic radiation- the speed of light. It is light. So the wavelength defines the frequency. The larger the wavelength the lower the frequency. The higher the frequency the lower the wavelength. Red light = 700nm wavelength, or a frequency of 4.29*10^14hz. Tomato tomato. Wavelength = Speed/Frequency
Before this, the ideas were murky in physics about the relationship between matter and energy. They were seen as different things. This basically demonstrated that all things are energy. Then it puts down the conversion between the two in a way that explains nuclear fusion, fission, and radioactivity. In real world ways it explained radioactivity. It also explained why Mercury’s orbit didn’t act in Newtonian physics ways, leading to a fundamentally different understanding of the universe.
They can fly through the air; if the air is moving then the medium they're flying through is also moving and they have to compensate for that. Airplanes and boats in water also have to compensate for this movement too. It's a trigonometry 101 problem to calculate the direction and speed you need to go at, to counteract the speed and direction of the wind. Most of the time birds are strong enough to overcome the wind and still go where they want to; if the wind is too strong and they can't fly fast enough to counteract it, they just can't fly in those conditions.
It's generally about ratios, rather than absolute amounts, with the understanding that there would be no decay product in the initial formation of the rock. For example, for uranium-lead dating, we choose minerals whose formation rejects lead. That is, there will be no lead incorporated into the crystal as it forms. There might, however, be uranium. After it is formed, that uranium can then decay into lead, remaining part of the crystal. We can then look at the amount of lead. Knowing that the detected amount of lead was once uranium we can calculate how long it would have taken that uranium to decay into the amount of lead that we see.
The movement of ice crystals and other particles inside the stormclouds causes them to collide; upon collision some particles gain a positive charge and the other particles gain a negative charge. The positively charged ones are carried upwards and thus leaving the bottom of the cloud negatively charged, which is the side closest to the ground. The negatively charged bottom of the cloud repels negative charges in the ground. The ground close to the storm loses its negative charge and becomes positive. Thus, the bottom of the stormcloud has become negatively charged and the surface of the ground has become positively charged, and lightning jumps between the two in order to restore balance
Not at all. It's stronger in a small place but doesn't have the range to affect earth at all. Just like a small flame doesn't cause an ocean to heat up significantly despite being much much hotter than it. Scientifically: Magnetic field strength is a local variable. It says something about how strong the force is at that point, but doesn't say anything about the total energy of the field. Earths magnetic field is weak locally, but huge.
Assuming you mean 'analogy' (and this isn't specific to Physics), it's the idea that - in the absence of any real world data to go on - you make an argument that X is True by proving that: &#x200B; a) X is like Y is certain important ways. b) Y is True based on data we do have.  c) The ways that X is \*not\* like Y are unimportant to b).  d) Therefore X is True &#x200B; So you may say, for example, that you have not observed whether your apartment block would fall down if one kitchen unit set on fire. But you have examples of other apartment blocks that are of similar size, similar construction materials and methods, built to similar standards, which \*have\* had kitchen fires and not fallen over. Therefore you can reasonably deduce that your apartment block wouldn't fall over either, in the event of a kitchen fire.  &#x200B; The problem, really, is proving 'C'. A dog and a cat share a lot of similar characteristics, and in many situations their differences are irrelevant - neither can survive without oxygen, both require milk when young etc - but in other situations their differences will be very important, like their chances of survival when thrown out of a window (in a kitchen fire, perhaps). So the success of the argument really hinges on one's ability to explain why their differences won't impact the result.
Do you mean the one way speed of light?
The actual tuna won't however depending on how it is done ice from water in the surrounding environment may settle on the tuna adding to the overall mass.
They use a magnetic field to wiggle the magnetic parts of the pan, which heats it up. The stovetop itself only gets heated by the pan, so it cools down quickly when the pan is removed.
Energy comes in tons of different shapes, like kinetic energy, heat and light. And the way it interacts with matter depends on both the type of energy and the matter, because different kinds of matter respond differently to various forms of energy.
The Universe might be infinite, there is some debate on this due to observation.  We can only see the Visible Universe, and we are sure that the Universe is larger. The Universe expands by increasing the space between every single thing in the Universe.  Conceptually the space between an electron and its nucleus expands, but the electromagnetic forces shift the electron back into place.  This means that the emptiness "accumulates" in the space between stars and planets.
The L2 point is a semi-stable point in the sun-earth system, where the gravity of the earth and the sun combine to keep objects in the same relative position. You can be a little off the point and naturally orbit around it, though only in certain directions. It's semi-stable in the sense that it's stable in some directions but not in others. Imagine placing a marble on a saddle. If it rolls forwards or backwards the slope of the saddle will roll it back the way it came. The James Webb orbit is equivalent to the marble constantly rolling back and forward on a saddle. But if the marble ever rolls left or right of the saddle centre-line, the slope will quickly accelerate it away; it's unstable in that direction. In the same way the James Webb must carefully maintain its distance from the sun or it will escape from L2.  That's why it must use manoeuvring thrusters periodically and they'll eventually run out of fuel. The L4 and L5 points are actually stable; you could orbit those using little or no fuel but they're much farther away than L2.
Salt water is denser than fresh water. Since floating is a function of how much water your bodyweight displaces, in a denser fluid you'll displace less of it for a given weight and thus you'll float higher and easier.
The other people aren't really answering where the energy comes from. Basically, the instrument turns moving air that the musician is blowing out of their mouth, into vibrating air that we perceive as sound. And really, sound doesn't involve much energy. Like, an instrument might put out just 0.001 W of power in the form of sound. That's tiny, much less energy than the kinetic energy of the moving air you blow out of your mouth. So, by converting just some of the energy of the moving air into sound energy, you can make a loud sound.
AC works by taking the water out of the air. This makes it colder. It feels different because the air is more dry than the air outside. When there is lots of water vapors in the air it feels different to our skin. Water likes to stick to things.
Depends whether we are looking at the wave model or particle model of light. In the wave model, light is a series of ripples in the electromagnetic field - ripples caused by charged particles wiggling around. As it passes through a material with other charged particles (e.g. electrons), those ripples cause the particles to wiggle a bit. Those wiggling particles then cause their own ripples, which mess with the original ripples, resulting in the overall ripples travelling a bit slower (or a bit faster in some cases). In the particle model, light is a series of individual photons. Those photons enter the optically-denser medium and then leave it at the point opposite. But in between quantum mechanics happens, and the light travels through *every possible path* between the two points (the entry point and the exit point), with a particular phase associated with each. The time it takes the photon to exit is the (weighted by phase) average of the time it takes for each of the paths. So this will be slightly longer than the time it would have taken to go straight through.
[heres a good explination on how it works](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/02/26/how-did-the-universe-expand-to-46-billion-light-years-in-just-13-8-billion-years/) Basically, its a complex explanation that is hard to boil down to a simple statement. The universe doesn't expand at the speed of light, its faster, as it expanses, it pulls things further away from us. So, while no galaxy is older than the universe, it is further away in light years than the universe is old.
An explosion is a vigorous outward release of energy, which generates something called a *shock wave.* This shock wave pressurizes the air ahead of it, which then expands outward ahead of the shock wave. When this pressurized mass of air hits the human body, it can do all sorts of damage to our squishy insides, even if no shrapnel or debris actually hits us.
It matters, a LOT, if the students can see what the hall ahead of them is doing. In fluid mechanics terms, this is whether you’re going supersonic or subsonic.  When you can see what’s coming (subsonic) you react to what’s ahead of you. If the hallway is getting narrower then you speed up because there’s less hallway and if you slow down you’ll get run over by the people behind you. If it’s getting wider you slow down because there’s more room.  But…if you don’t know what’s coming you don’t have the option…that’s supersonic. If it gets narrower you slow down because you’re getting squeezed together and if it widens out you speed up because you have more directions you can go. What’s “upstream” can’t influence your actions because you can’t “see” it. The rule of thumb is that a convergence *always* pushes you towards Mach 1 (speed of sound, sonic flow). This is why you can’t do an infinitely converging nozzle…at some point the flow goes sonic and “chokes”…for the temperature and pressure of the incoming gas, you can’t get anymore through. If you make the hole smaller from there you just get less flow. So it’ll be subsonic or sonic at the narrowest point, then if you want to accelerate to supersonic past that you need to diverge.  All of the above assumes you aren’t adding/removing heat to the flow…if you do that (heated ducts, combustion in the duct, etc.) things get weirder.
In the same way that it takes time for water to come out of your hose and hit the ground. There's a constant stream of light coming out, but any individual bit of light, if you were to track it individually, would take 8 minutes to make it from the Sun to the Earth.
Consider a [Round-up amusement park ride](http://www.blenheimamusements.co.uk/upload/U21484_meteorite-fair-ride.jpg) If we look at it while its spinning you have very difference forces than when its still. The people are very clearly pushed against the wall by an outward force, this is the Centrifugal force.  It manifests because their inertia wants to keep them moving in a straight line but the wall catches them and pushes them inward.  Its a fictitious force when you look at a non-rotating reference frame, but in a rotating reference frame its real enough. The walls pushing back on people and keeping them from flying off into the distance is providing the centripetal force, its an inward force.  Its actually the normal force from the wall, but again for rotating reference frames looking at and talking about centripetal and centrifugal forces is more intuitive The Coriolis effect comes from something moving through the rotating frame being observed by an observer rotating with the reference frame.  If someone on the wall were to take a ball and throw it directly towards the center, the ball would take a curved path from their perspective because they have continued to move around the circle.  In practice, the ball left the rotating frame and entered an inertia reference frame and from the ball's perspective it traveled perfectly straight towards the center of the ride, it was the people on the rim who moved.
"Gone" and "Reduced to a fine paste of indistinguishable biological matter" mean effectively the same thing.  *A building fell on top of people*. If a slab of concrete lands on top of a body there might not BE much left to recover.
The big bang didn't happen in one spot, with everything expanding out from that one point.  It happened *everywhere*.  If you look 1 billion light years your left, the big bang happened over there. And of you look 1 billion light years to your right, the big bang happened over there too. And if you look right where you're standing, the big bang happened there too. It's kind of hard to explain, but the best guess we have right now is that space itself is infinite - like, if you traveled 14 billion years to the farthest galaxy you can see, and looked out in the same direction you were traveling, you would see more galaxies 14 billion light years away.  And if you traveled to those, you would see even more. So, imagine an infinite number line, from negative infinity to positive infinity.  What is the center of the line?  You might say zero, but in reality  *any* number on the number line is the center.   If you pick +100, there are infinite numbers less than 100, and infinite numbers greater than 100.  If you pick -1,000,000,000 there are infinite numbers less than negative one billion, and infinite numbers greater than negative one billion.  So, from any point in the universe, we can look on any direction and see the echo of the big bang - The Cosmic Microwave Background.  By measuring the expansion rate of the universe, we can figure out how much energy the CMB loses as it travels. And with some strong theoretical knowledge of recombination - the temperature at which electrons, protons, and neutrons form atoms - we can figure out the amount of time it took for the CMB to cool from recombination temperature to it's current temperature. All without being able to see beyond our own personal observable corner of the universe.
Boiling and freezing points are dependent on pressure. E.g. If you increase the pressure, you can increase the boiling point if water and therefore hest it to more than 100°C. In freezing a second effect can also be used: supercooling. Freezing needs nucleation sites to occur (that is small impurities or sharp edges that the first ice crystal can form on. If you have a perfectly homogeneous distilled water in a perfectly smooth container it won't freeze because of a lack of nucleation sites. You can then make this water go from liquid to ice almost instantly by introducing a nucleation site, e.g. by pouring it. Because it's colder than its freezing point, as soon as it gets a nucleation site it will freeze almost instantly
Food warms up by absorbing the heat. The more food put in the oven means more heat is needed. Only so much heat can be produced at certain temperatures as they vary in amounts of energy.
Yep it's matter and all matter is subject to gravity so eventually it will be drawn to the closest celestial object like Earth, the moon, Mars, etc.
Weight is the quantification of how much gravitational force gravity is putting on an object
It's not an ELI5 question, but the answer is yes, a little. Bathroom exhaust fans push air to the outside from the bathroom. Unless you're in a bomb shelter your house isn't perfectly sealed, so air will come in anywhere it can to replace what was blown out, from imperfectly sealed windows to pinhole leaks, anywhere in the house.
The blue ones are coated with an anti-reflective coating that helps with efficiency and absorption rate. The way they're made, by basically melting silicone crystals together, makes them less efficient than the black panels, but much much cheaper. They're called polycrystalline because they're made up of a bunch of tiny silicone crystals melted together. The black ones are monocrystalline, they're just one big perfectly aligned crystal. It's more efficient, so it doesn't need the anti-reflective coating, but it's a lot more expensive to make them.  Blue ones range from 13-17% efficiency, black ones are from 15-20%ish.
There is a compressor behind thet fridge that pushes together a gas in a set of tubes. When the gas is pushed together it gets hotter, but the same amount of gas still contains the same heat. The heat is just pushed together too. The tubes then goes a long way behind the back of the fridge, letting the air in the room pass by the now hot tubes. That air makes the tubes colder. About room temperature. After that, the gas is decompressed, so it gets pulled apart again. Since the hot part of the tubes took heat away from the gas, the gas is now way colder than room temperature.  That cold gas is led along the tubes to the part connected to the inside of the fridge. There, the gas gets warmer again from the heat inside the fridge, while the fridge gets colder. The warm gas then goes to the compressor again, and such it goes around and around.
The propane flame heats water and ammonia. Once it boils it goes to a chamber where it cools into a liquid and flows into another chamber that has hydrogen gas in it. The hydrogen combines with the ammonia and the chemical reaction pulls heat from inside the refrigerator. After the reaction the hydrogen separates and the ammonia returns to a gaseous state and recombines with the water and the process starts all over again.
Light is made of photons, which are electromagnetic waves. When an electric field changes a little bit, a magnetic field appears, and when a magnetic field changes a little, an electric field appears. So, when an electric field changes a little in a small region, a magnetic field appears around that region. Which means a magnetic field has changed, so an electric field appears outside of that region. Which means an electric field has changed and... Etc. So, in a way? The photon cannot do anything *except* move around away from its starting location (for example, when an electron drops from a high energy orbital around an atom or molecule to a low energy orbital). So light is very much like dropping a rock into a pond. The water goes down in the center, which pushes the water up around that region, which pulls the water down in the region around that. And the ripple spreads outward that way. A really good question is "why are electric and magnetic fields linked this way?" and that question is One Of The Big Unsolved Problems In Physics. We have a lot of competing models/ideas to answer this question, but we don't know which (if any) are correct. In order to rule out bad hypotheses, we smash particles together at high speed inside particle colliders and build massive neutrino detectors deep inside the earth: some of our ideas make predictions about what happens and how often, so if we run lots of experiments we can rule out the bad hypotheses.
You said it yourself. The universe is expanding but the amount of energy in it remains constant. Therefore it cools as it expands.
Two ways.  The first is satellite. GPS satellites all have atomic clocks in them. They're also fairly close to line of sight at the speed of light with only some minor variations in the speed of light over comparably short distances. This makes it extremely easy to compute the delay almost exactly using high precision timers and special receivers. Using the GPS system to distribute time from the US atomic clock we can get the variance between the different atomic clocks down to 10^-16 seconds. The other way we can do it is by direct optical cable. It's a medium that can have its length precisely calculated, the speed of light well known and controlled, and delay measured by the atomic clocks directly which can get the variance down to a few 10^-17 seconds.
Technique? I can't do it but you reverse the movement of walking forwards. The trick part of it is that you shift your weight to your front foot and then you slide your back foot lightly along the floor.  Now witha ton of practice this eventually looks smooth.
We mean 14 billion years in our (Earth’s) frame of reference.  As long as you specify where you’re talking about, relativity isn’t a problem.
Why would it require some continuous transfer of energy? The object simply exists and has this effect. The presence of the object warps spacetime and there is no reason this should require energy. After all, there is no work being done - why should energy be consumed?
The strings are trivially affected by gravity - the weightlessness wouldn’t have any noticeable effect. If you’re playing it inside a space station with an atmosphere it would sound about the same as it does on earth, but with likely shitty acoustics from the structure around you. If you were not rigidly tethered your body would rotate counter to the direction of your arm motion at any time, but total rotation should be negligible. A possible effect after a while could be if the string vibrations are pushing air away towards specific direction, then after a while you’d start to rotate counter to that direction. If you were playing outside without an atmosphere the strings don’t have anything to transfer vibrations to so would make no sound. They’d vibrate for longer, because they’re not losing energy to sound production. The energy from the vibration would eventually turn to heat as it gets damped by the violin and your holding it, and then radiated away.
A matter of wavelength. An efficient antenna has to be roughly the size of the wavelength it is meant to pick up, which is manageable for radio waves but would need to be microscopic for visible light (around 0.5 micrometers). Another way to look at that is that electromagnetic radiation behaves mostly like a wave at long wavelengths (low energy) and more and more like particles (photons) with shorter wavelengths (higher energy). Light is somewhere in-between and can show both behaviors: wave-like in interference experiments (see the numerous "double slit" experiments on Youtube) and particle-like with special detectors able to register individual photons.
Every time light hits something it gets absorbed a bit. Depending on the material, it might reflect and absorb different wavelengths differently. But eventually all light gets absorbed by something in that room, which happens very fast because of how fast light travels.
There's this concept called "entropy" that sort of means "chaos" in a weird way.  What it means is if we have some water dyed red and some water dyed blue, we have to do something special to put them in the same container and NOT mix the dyes. The red water is full of red particles, the blue water is full of blue particles. When they are both touching, it's like the universe cringes. The blue particles want to move where the red particles are, and the red particles want to move to where the blue particles are. Eventually, they're all equally spread out and you have purple water. So basically, unless we fight it, the system will go from orderly to chaos. That's entropy. This also happens with heat. If you put a flame under one side of a spoon, eventually the entire spoon will heat up to the same temperature. You can't have one side being hot and the other side being cold for long, Physics sees this as the same as the red and blue dye. Why? Well, all stuff is made out of particles. When something is warm, its particles are vibrating and moving pretty quickly. When it's cold, they move slowly. So when one side of the spoon's hot, those crazy fast particles keep bumping into the slow particles. That both makes the slow particles move a little faster *and* makes the fast particles lose some energy and move a little slower. That's why the spoon's temperature eventually evens out. That's entropy at work. The universe hates this kind of order, where there's a lot of heat in one place (the sun, Earth) and very little in another (space). It wants everything to be "chaotic", which means the same. So heat death applies the spoon experiment at a grand scale. The Earth is like the spoon. We lose heat to the universe. But the Sun is beating on us with energy and putting heat back into us. That's kind of chaotic, and the universe doesn't like it. One day, the sun will burn enough of its fuel to where it can't support its reactions anymore. Then it stops putting out heat. Then the Earth gets really cold, the same temperature as the space around us.  Imagine that happening across the universe. When every star burns out, there's no more heat being blasted out into space. A few millions of years after that, the temperature will equalize. That's heat-death. It's not a fun place to be for us.
We can't do that, there is an estimation of the minimum size but the size might be infinite. We only know of large the [Observable\_universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe) is and it is done by knowing how old the universe is and how it expands in size and you get a result of the current size of radius of 46.5 billion light-years. This is the part of the universe that is possible to observe from the earth. The size is the current size. What is today 46.5 billion light-years away was a lot closed when it emitted the light that reaches us now. The light from it only has traveled the age of the universe to us. So the light for the object 46.5 billion light-years away only has traveled 13.7 billion light-years. From the measurement of the flatness of the universe, you can come to the conclusion that it is at least 250 times the size of the observable universe. So it might be finite but it might also be infinite in size. So we do not know the size of the universe it is an open field of research where we have not reached a conclusion. It might be the case that it is impossible to know the size. So the best estimation is 250 times the observable universe to infinite size.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe#Size_and_regions
As the wind blows outside past the open window it causes a low pressure area based on the Venturi effect, that low pressure causes the air in the room to move to equalise the air pressure; The air moving in the room towards the window causes the door to swing.
Assuming that the boxes are all at the same level and the connecting pipes are all at the same level: 1. If every box has the same level of water, nothing happens. 2. If Box 2 has more water, it will lose water until the levels equalize. 3. If Box 1 and 3 have more water, they will lose water until the levels equalize.
With a gas or diesel engine the engine has to spin to provide any power at all to the wheels.  If you want more power then you can only add more fuel up to a point.  At some point getting more power out of an engine means you have to have the engine spin faster.  On the other hand, the faster the engine is spinning the more energy goes into just making the engine spin, and there's a limit on how fast you can get all of the countless moving parts to go through their motions.  For maximum efficiency you pretty much want the engine spinning as slow as possible. That gives a conundrum: how do you make it so that the engine can spin fast or slow when the wheels are spinning slow or fast?  The solution here is a transmission, which gives options for the ratio of the speed of the engine to the speed of the wheels.  Want lots of power while going slow? Low gears make it so the engine spins lots of times per rotation of the wheels.  Want efficient driving while going fast?  High gears are the ticket. Electric motors don't have that issue.  To get more power out of an electric motor you pump more electricity through it.  More power than that?  More electricity!  The speed that the motor is turning at has relatively little impact on how much energy you can make the motor output, so there's much less value in having a transmission to be able to choose the motor speed for a given vehicle speed.
Your body is roughly at 37C. Your body is also constantly generating heat. That heat has to go somewhere, and heat flows from hot to cold. Air is a poor conductor of heat. So having cooler air is fine, because that temperature difference helps to overcome air's poor heat conductivity (conductivity isn't the right word, but it's good enough for this concept). Water is a good conductor of heat. So having cooler water is bad, because it takes away heat too quickly. Your body has to work harder to make more heat to make up for it. Warmer water is good, because the smaller temperature difference makes up for water's high conductivity (again, conductivity isn't the right word). Warm air is bad because, being a poor conductor of heat, your body can't dump its heat fast enough. It has to sweat in order to do it, which is uncomfortable for you, or its temperature has to increase, which is both uncomfortable and dangerous. So cool air or warm water are comfortable to be in because they best match your body's rate of heat generation.
Well - we live on continents, not peninsulas... And yes you see different stars if you're south of the equator than you do if you're north of it.  You cannot see the Southern Cross from Maine and you can't see the Big Dipper from South Africa, for example. Stars that are more in alignment with our equator are visible from both hemispheres.
Can you explain that a bit more? I’m not really sure what you’re referring to
We could, but we have much more reliable ways to generate energy. Lightning is unpredictable and doesn't happen with anywhere near enough frequency to meet modern energy demands. We can generate a lot more electricity using the power plants we already have, and we can do so reliably enough that we can build a power grid on top of them without having to wait for the right weather.
The trampoline example is useful for demonstrating orbits, but it's kind of prone to overthinking ("then what's pulling the bowling ball down?"). The scenario I like better is if you imagine that you and I are standing 1 meter apart at the equator, and we each have a compass, and we're both going to walk north at the same speed. If the earth was flat, lines of longitude would be parallel, and every time I would look over at you you would be 1 m away. Because the earth is curved though, longitude lines converge at the north pole. This means very gradually we would find each other getting closer and closer together, even though we're both following our line north. Now if we didn't \*know\* the earth was curved, we would have to conclude that there's some attractive force between us that's pulling us together.  This is how spacetime is. Everything (even a beam of light) is following it's own "straight line" (geodesic) but the curve of those lines is what produces gravity, makes light rays bend, etc.
Air on Earth isn't at a constant pressure throughout the globe. There are 'pockets' of high pressure and low pressure areas. Wind is simply air moving from a high pressure area to a low pressure area. Differences in pressure are typically caused by differences in temperature. You can learn more [here](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind).
No, landing from jumping requires much more acceleration than just standing there.  You are going from moving at a speed to stopped in a very short distance (depending on the squishiness of your shoes).  That takes significant acceleration **plus** the regular 9.8 m/s^2 acceleration needed to keep you a constant distance from the core of the Earth.
This question is based on a common misconception. The Big Bang didn't happen in a specific location, it happened **everywhere**. The idea though is that all *locations* were much closer together in the early universe so all places had basically no distance from each other. As the universe expanded more distance rapidly came into existence; things weren't flying apart moving *through* space, the *space itself* was getting more distant from other locations. The universe even when very close and dense was still likely infinite in extent.
Ionizing means an electron can be broken off an atom. (The radiation gives the electron so much energy that it can get away from its atom) These electrons are what holds molecules together. So when you kick an electron out the molecule suddenly has some dangling end and will quickly try to find a new electron somewhere (I.E. react with whatever it can find) DNA is a very long and complex molecule. Damaging it in this way might completely destroy it (then the cell is basically dead) but there is also a chance that the damage isn't completely fatal but rather changes the encoded genes. That has some chance to cause the cell to go haywire (become cancer, when it's growth control and self destruct mechanism are both broken). As you see it's basically a freak accidant when that happens. So small amounts of radiation are quite save (and we're exposed to that 24/7). But the more radiation you're exposed to the higher the chance something breaks in a nasty way
Imagine a light ray emitted/reflected from a specific single point on an object. If your aperture is infinitely small, there's only one position that ray can ever end up after going through the aperture. Do this for all rays emitted from said object, and since there's only one place for each ray to end up, which is related to where it was emitted from, you get an exact replica of the observed object. If your aperture is bigger however, you could have two rays coming off the same single point on an object, leaving at slightly different angles yet still going through the aperture. Since that single point somehow gets represented in two places after passing through the aperture, blur happens.
500 million years of the evolution of complex life. We have evolved to move in 3 dimensions. Some organisms can plan for the future and therefore take into consideration the dimension of time. A 4th spacial dimension has no relevance or meaning to our lived existence (so far). That's if its even real. So not just humans but no animal could visualise it. Its nowhere in the coding of life as we know it
[Here's a helpful graphic of the proton-proton chain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Fusion_in_the_Sun.svg/700px-Fusion_in_the_Sun.svg.png) Assuming "hydrogen" here is referring to a single proton, and not Deuterium (H-2) or tritium (H-3) then smashing 3 together will get you to He-3. Generally two protons hit, now you have He-2(helium with no neutrons) which is super unstable so in less than 1 ns it shoots off a positron to turn a proton into a neutron and becomes Deuterium (H-2), then you smack a proton into the Deuterium to get He-3. Proton-proton interactions are incredibly rare and slow which is why the sun will last for billions of years and we try to cut to the chase and isolate Deuterium and Tritium for our reactors rather than slowly creating it as we go If you were to somehow smash all 3 together then you would very briefly end up with Lithium-3 but without any neutrons to hold it together it will fall apart extremely quickly.  Lithium-4 decays into He-3 in 9x10^-23 seconds and Lithium-3 lives even less time which makes Helium-3's 10^-9 second half life seem long by comparison
Because its actually a giant nuclear reaction happening instead of it simply burning away. It's converting lighter elements into heavier elements which releases light and heat and energy, because there is so much of the sun it can do this for a very long time.
This is an interesting question. We don't actually know in the sense of 'does anyone else experience visual sensations like anyone else?' The important thing is the subjective part. We can measure how e.g. cells in the eye react to colored light. But whether your red is the same as my red is something we just can't say. Your red could be my blue subjectively but there's no way to find this out because we would agree on everything but can't express or show our inner sensation in an independent way. It's not exactly eli5 but if you care about the topic of constructing reality please read up on constructivism which is a very different view on how we actually create reality in our heads.
In addition remember that campfires or bonfires tend to be in wide open spaces with no surfaces for the light to reflect off of. Indoor lights seem to “carry” more because they reflect off walls or ceilings, etc.  Even indoor fireplaces are designed to dissipate heat/light as quickly as possible to avoid overheating and combusting any nearby surfaces.
1. take a sheet of paper 2. cut out a strip along one of the longer sides. make it not too narrow, but not too wide. 3-4cm will suffice 3. turn one of the (short) edges around, and, without letting it go, glue the opposite end to it 4. take a pencil and start drawing a line along the long edge 5. you'll find yourself going back to the starting point despite not crossing any edges [some](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ImoL-fWsLmWpctchwzXA65ROKFcwbxeiliQt72Jicvi0vyo0g9HFrYNuQbdV8Vlp-cujcUr_rAbozRro6FYg8A) [pictures](http://www.indepthinfo.com/mathematics/images/mobius-strip.jpg) [to](https://darylchow.com/frontiers/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/images-6.jpeg) help illustrate what's going on and I wouldn't say it 'portrays' anything apart from being quite an interesting geometrical thingy in itself.
Apart from pupil dilatation mentioned by another commenter, it also has a lot to do with the reflection created on glass surfaces: if you're in a room at night and light up a lamp you'll notice that you can clearly see the reflection of the room on the window, but not what's outside. This is because the light coming from the lamp, which is reflected by the glass, is much more intense than that coming from outside, which in turn gets suppressed by the former. The result is that your eye perceives only the reflected light, making it hard to see outside.
If there isn't too much of it, and it it's left alone, hot gas in outer space will disperse. The molecules just float further and further away, so the gas pressure falls toward zero. And the "gas laws" tell us that when the pressure falls, so does the temperature. So the gas cools off as this happens. You've got the right idea. (*edit:* ...Sort of. The temperature doesn't quite approach absolute zero when this happens. It approaches a temperature which is determined by the amount and frequency of radiation present in that area of space. Things can't really approach absolute zero unless they're also receiving zero radiation from their environment.) BUT, if there's enough gas, then the gravitational attraction of the gas starts to matter more, and overcomes the gas' tendency to spread out and disperse. Gravity pulls the gas into a smaller volume, raising its pressure - and its temperature. A gas giant planet like Jupiter or Saturn can be the result of this process, and once the gas is packed into a ball-shaped planet, then its pressure and internal temperature can be very high. If there's even more gas than that, it can get so hot inside that nuclear reactions start happening, and then you get a star instead of a planet, just like our Sun!
The button is irrelevant it's just a locking mechanism so the handbrake can't come undone when it's used as a parking brake. The main difference is that the foot brake pedals are designed not to lock up the wheels, and most modern cars will have anti lock braking systems. A handbrake isn't supposed to be used while you're driving, as such it isn't designed or engineered to prevent wheel lock (in fact keeping the wheels locked is specifically what's it's designed for) so it's easier to initiate a drift with a handbrake
Our eyes have three different kinds of cones, which are attuned to roughly "red", "green", and "blue" When you take a "purple" object, what you are seeing is an object that has absorbed a lot of the "green" light and is reflecting both "blue" and "red" This activates both your "Red" and "Blue" cones in the same spots, which your brain cobbles together into a sensation of "bluish red", which we call "purple"
They fall down, but they probably don't land exactly in the spot they were fired from because of the wind. They get blown off course and land somewhere else.  But, yes, there are cases of bullets fired into the air landing and hitting people, it's pretty dangerous. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebratory_gunfire#Notable_incidents
Because light =/= heat energy.  Metal is a conductor of heat energy (amongst other things).
To make a nuclear explosion you need an element that, upon absorbing one neutron (a subatomic particle) of any energy level, will split, releasing energy and more neutrons that can continue the reaction. It's not about just splitting "an" atom, it's creating a chain reaction so that you can split a trillion trillion atoms in a millisecond or so.  There are only a small number of types of atoms that meet the above criteria (the technical term for this is "fissile"), and of those, only two are "easy" to produce in bulk: uranium-235 (a specific type of uranium that can be separated from normal uranium in special facilities), and plutonium-239 (and artificial element that is made in nuclear reactors). Even these are not "easy" to make by any reasonable standard, but they are a lot easier than the other kind.  So there are real physical constraints on what the options are. Uranium-238, the most common form of uranium, cannot work in a bomb like this, because even though it _can_ be split by neutrons, it can only be split by high-energy neutrons, and the neutrons produced by splitting atoms are not high-enough energy to have a chain reaction in U-238. (This is why you have to separate the U-235 from the U-238.)
It... isn't. One of the most basic rules of the universe is that energy is (in general, on average) neither created nor destroyed. If you mean something like "why are there spinning things in electrical generators?" it's because of the way we convert one type of energy into another. You use one type of energy, like chemical power in gasoline or mechanical power from wind, to move a magnet past a conductor/vice versa. When you move a conductor through a magnetic field, it moves electrons in the conductor. When electrons are moving, we call it "electricity". (Remember: electricity is an action not a noun). The easiest way to move things that way, from an engineering point of view, is rotation. The other alternative would be something like the carriage return on a typewriter or something even more baroque, inefficient and harder to build and use. Does that help?
Physics is about the rules. Engineering is about how those rules can be used to build things. The two are of course very closely related, in the same way that (say) pure math and applied math, biology and medicine, or computer science and programming are, but they have different goals. As an example, physics gives you the tools to understand the strength of a metal, and why some metals are stronger than others. Engineering tells you how to use that strength to build a bridge that won't collapse.
When light hits a surface, parts of it bounces off (reflected). The remainder goes through (transmitted) or gets absorbed. Black colored objects absorb most of the visible wavelengths of light that don't get reflected. The portion that does get reflected can produce a glossy finish if the surface is very smooth or polished. You can sometimes purposely add a glossy finish by applying a separate coating layer. This top coat increases the reflection before the light hits the black paint to be absorbed.
Not enough hot glue Transformers are coils of wire around an iron core.  When you pass current through the coils they generate a magnetic field, since we pass alternating current through the coils they generate an alternating magnetic field Every time this field ramps up it physically squishes the iron core and pushes the wires away from it, and then switches to pulling the wires towards the core as the field flips.  For big power pole transformers this is tens of pounds of metal moving about and it rattles and generates that characteristic 50/60 Hz hum you hear from them For things like phone charges, they're using a much higher frequency(132 kHz is common) to let them use smaller transformers so you won't hear the sound created by each cycle, but you will hear the natural resonance of the core vibrating over time.  A big ol' dollop of hot glue is generally the solution to this problem and connects the core to the housing and damps out the vibrations quite well.
there's a concept in engineering called "slip" that measures the slow progression of fasteners, adhesives, and and other structural members as they slip away from their intended position due to everyday use, vibrations, thermal expansion / contraction, etc.  I remember studying it in school to understand how subway tiles eventually fall off the ceiling and walls.
Hi /u/akinkin! Physics is an inductive science. That is, knowledge is constructed through observation and experimentation, and the truth value of statements is determined by the question whether or not they agree with our observations.  Thus, the aim of physics is to look at the outside world and try to describe them in a formalized manner.  Therefore, Newton's laws of motion are not *derived* in a mathematical sense. Rather, they are *[axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)*. That is, these are statements which cannot be derived in a mathematical manner. Rather, they just assumed to be true as a jumping off point to formulate a theory. If it turns out that these axioms do not accurately describe and explain the behaviour of the outside world, they are reparied or discarded. In essence, Newton simply looked at the way objects behave and tried to guess the equations that accurately describe this behaviour. (Well that and by building on the observations and statements of previous thinkers)
Nothing. Space itself is expanding. The concept of space outside of space doesn't exist at least as far as modern understanding of physics goes. It is hard for us to understand since we can only see and measure the space we live in, just like it is hard for us to visualize 4 or more dimensions of space since we have only ever experienced 3.
Water Towers don't exist to distribute water.  They exist to maintain water pressure.  Why?  Because gravity doesn't cost anything. Think of a water tower as a bathtub. You fill the water up to the brim and then you open the drain.  Once you do this, the pipe connected to the drain is at 100% pressure.  Meaning the water in the tub is keeping the pipe completely pressurized....and it will stay that way until the tub is empty. The water tower works the same way except the drain is always open. When the water level gets low, the pump kicks on and it fills the water tower up faster than it's being drained out.  That way, gravity keeps the pipes pressurized.  That's why towers are up high instead of on the ground.  The extra height makes sure the reservoir is always up higher than any of the pipes in the area...thus maintaining pressure. It's simple energy conservation.   It costs municipalities far less to run a pump every so often to feed a water tower...than it would to run a pump 24/7/365 to keep the pipes fully pressurized
When the wind comes from the other side of the house, it flows over a house.  Since a house is not aerodynamic, it creates a lower pressure on the other side than the still air in the house and leakage from the other side.  Fluid, which air is, goes from high pressure to low pressure.  So since right after the house, its a very low pressure, it feels as wind is blowing thru the window to outside.
Sound is nothing but vibrations of a medium.  When you clap your hands together it causes the air to vibrate.  This vibration travels through the air to your ears where your brain interprets that vibration as sound.
Contrast is basically "light" or "no light." If you have light scattering into the no light areas then you have "light" and "some light" which is hopefully intuitively lower contrast. If all of the light scatters then you have "some light" and "some light" which is zero contrast and you have no picture.
Frequency is the number of waves that pass through a stationary location in one second. If your waves are moving faster, then obviously more will pass any given location in one second. If your waves move slower, fewer will pass through any given location in a second.  So frequency is proportional to wave speed.  Period is just the inverse of frequency. It’s the amount of time it takes for one wave to pass through a location. If the waves are moving faster, that will be less time. If the waves are moving slower, it’ll be more.  Period is inversely proportional to wave speed.
This might be an illustration best done in person.  Head outside with your kids.  You stand in place, slowly turning in circles while pointing.  Tell the kid(s) that their goal is to move so that you're always pointing at them.  Have them start close to you, where they'll just need to walk slowly to keep up.  Then, have them move further away, keep turning at the same pace, and watch as they have to run to keep up.
>A modern home is fairly air tight for heat efficiency sake.      No. Homes generally have sufficient ventilation. Insulation of a home is mainly concerned with heat *radiation* and direct heat transfer via walls and windows, not with convection. The air in your house carries a ludicrously insignificant amount of heat energy, having it replaced throughout the day is therefore not really a concern. If you feel an actual *breeze* inside then obviously something has gone wrong, but that isn't required for sufficient ventilation.     Way before CO2 ever becomes a concern in your average dwelling air moisture will become a bigger problem if you never open the window and don't leave your room.
Black is the absence of colour whilst white is the accumulation of every colour, or atleast that is my understanding.
The switch for the wipers is built into the steering column not too far away from the explosive charge that expands the airbag. Often that gets broken and stuck in the on position after deployment.
Atoms also experience this. Larger atoms experience radioactive decay. Smaller atoms still experience decreasing entropy. They lose energy over time. The time scale is large and the energy loss is tiny so we do not observe it as easily as radioactive decay. Not ELI5 but Look up the second law of thermodynamics and the heat death of the universe.
The energy of two magnets repelling is put in when you put them next to eachother to begin with. Analogous to the energy of a spring being compressed - it just returns the energy you put into it. It doesn't last forever, as magnets do lose their magnetism over time, but since it does not consume energy to maintain their magnetic field there is no fundamental limit to how long it can last. As such a decent magnet could last thousands of years.
Its the rails, they literally vaporize over time Railguns and coil/gauss guns are often confused but distinctly different, so just to be clear what we're talking about here A coil gun has coils of wire that a strong current runs through to generate a strong magnetic field and launch a magnetic projectile A railgun has two conductive rails down the length that a conductive projectile/sled slide down. The current flows down on rail, across the projectile/sled, and back to the source.  Its this sliding that's a problem.  The projectile doesn't make great electrical contact with the rails which means an arc forms and eats away the rail the whole way down the barrel which greatly shortens their lifespan.  The Navy's experimental one was initially burning out the rails in 10s of shots, later on they said it lasted "400" shots but didn't say these were full power. The rails also generate significant magnetic fields as the current flows down them and they push away from each other so you need massive bolts to keep it from flying apart
So... you're half right. In general, the thinking "The larger the boat, the less affected it is by the waves" is correct on one standpoint, but it fails dramatically in others. So in short, Tiny boats, have little mass. The mass of the water moving and the momentum that it has will greatly overpower small boats, and even some ships. It's able to literally move mountains of moving steel in the water, lifting up even battleships and aircraft carriers when the seas are upset enough. Though as you become more massive, those waves become less of a nuisance... until you get to waves of a significant size. While we can always build a bigger ship, so too, can the ocean make a bigger wave. Ships so large that they would cross multiple Square Miles of ocean, for instance, would be greatly affected by shifting ocean tides and waves on many fronts. The construction genuis it would take to make a floating island sized object wouldn't just need to take water into account but specific gravity, air pressure, and even the temperature of the air and water to ensure the ocean did not claim this hypothetical island sized ship. The bigger you make it, the more forces work against it. And their application is not always even.
Take a slice of bread, butter it. Strap it, butter side up, to a cat. Now pick them up and drip them. It is a universal law that buttered toast will always land buttered side down when dropped, but another universal law is that cats will always land on their feet. Combining the two in such a way that dropping them prevents the universal law applying will obviously cause an anti-gravity effect as both laws struggle to remain true. Only dogs or an anime character running late for school can disrupt such a thing.
Traditionally it was in physics but the parts of physics associated with it simply drifted into engineering territory. The benefits of fluid flow, turbulence, etc modelling is absolutely priceless for basically all machinery, vehicles, medical equipment and implants, etc. It’s basically as relevant to every day life (and government interests…) as improvements in electronics. So a lot of research and development is done or contracted by engineering corporations (including big fat national defense budgets).   Continuum mechanics does have some relevance for space. In fact it’s a critical puzzle piece in how our specific solar system even formed from spinning gas and dust. Recently there was discussion about whether the solar system has a shock wave, as the vacuum of space itself constitutes a weak continuum over that length scale.  But of course theorising about space is less applicable to every day life (and big sticks) and more just cool stuff for research entities to look at. And that’s kind of where physics is drifting towards… researching cool but more obscure stuff
They honestly can't. What heater are you referring to? They may be inefficient for some uses (i.e. getting heat to where it's desired), but you are correct that all that electricity is released as heat.
Your esophagus has muscular walls that push food toward the stomach via a process called "peristalsis"--think of the way an earthworm moves around despite having no limbs. So, while it might not be particularly comfortable to eat upside down, it's certainly possible.
It helps to separate dirt from air. Dust particles are heavier than air, and therefore can't keep up with the tight turns in the vortex. So instead of all the dust being stopped only by the filter, most of the dust collects on the outside walls, increasing the amount of dust you can suck up until the filter is clogged.
The toxins are created by bacteria.  The bacteria create the toxins as a by product of their internal processes with using food.  It's no more a violation of the first law of thermodynamics than you eating and pissing and shitting is.
You can.  But you need to carry that fuel, so there's far more mass to accelerate requiring even more fuel.  But in theory, if you had a sufficiently efficient engine or an outside fuel supply that could supply fuel as you accelerate, you can go pretty darn fast. Now at some point relativistic effects come into play whereby the faster you try to go, the more massive you become, requiring ever more fuel to eke out additional acceleration.  But that's not really ELI5 material.
Electrons are bound to their atomic nuclei reasonably well, like a tetherball on a bungee cord, but that cord isn't infinitely strong You can hit them with a bat(mid power photon) to give them some extra energy and stretch out the bungee cord, but the cord will pull them back in and they'll give off the extra energy as a twang(photon in this case) Gamma rays take this to more of an extreme.  You're not pulling on the tether ball or hitting it with a bat to give it some more energy, you're putting it on the barrel of a battleship gun and shooting it point blank.  The gamma ray hits the electron and it has sooooo much energy that it overwhelms any pull to the atomic nuclei and it just goes flying off away from the nuclei You can pull it off with wayyy lower energy levels too.  Ionizing radiation (generally UV-C through Xrays to Gamma rays) all have enough energy that when they hit an electron they can give it enough energy to break free from its nuclei and go flying off.  Most things below are just absorbed and then turned into kinetic energy (wobblier atoms) or given off as light (think things that glow under blacklights)
Plane engines don't work without oxigen to ignite the fuel and without air getting sucked through the turbines, so it can't do powered flight up in outer space. But yes, if a plane somehow can reach the correct speed at the correct height, like the ISS did, it would keep falling indefinitely (aka orbiting), like the ISS does. Every mass would. That's how all our satellites and the moon don't come crashing down. And how Earth itself doesn't crash into the sun.  Within the athmosphere, un-powered orbiting is not possible. The friction slows things down and so the whole trick with keeping your sideway speed to keep falling past the earth doesn't work. If you aren't lighter than air, you need some kind of force to keep you up. The ISS has no thrusters strong enough to keep itself afloat.
They don’t touch but they can still repel each other. In other words, one atom pushes against another which pushes against another and so on.
We do get more energy every day, but we don't *keep* it. We, and all things on earth, constantly radiate and lose the energy we get from the Sun, it's transient for us. In order to keep this energy, we would need to convert it into something more permanent. Plants are able to do this via photosynthesis. Sunlight + water makes more plant. The energy from the Sun that has hit the leaves is now stored inside the new plant that is growing. Additionally, we have solar power technology - that is solar energy panels that capture and store the energy from the Sun, by converting sunlight into electricity. Edit: The vast majority of the energy we get from the Sun heats our planet during the day, and then a lot of it is lost during the night. Our atmosphere shields us from completely losing all heat and freezing to death for a short while, until the Sun rises again the next day, and heats that side of the planet once more. This process repeats every day. If the Sun suddenly disappeared and we'd be stuck in a perpetual night, we'd quickly lose all the heat trapped by the atmosphere and Earth would freeze to the temperature of outer space, which is -455 degrees F (-270C). So good thing the Sun is still here and it rises again every day, heating us all up in the process!
1. Degradation is cumulative. So it's not the case that only X pieces fail in a given time period, but rather the number of failures is only going to increase, and it is already prohibitively expensive to send things into space. 2. Not everything can be fixed in space. It is a complex machine and they may simply not have the access or expertise to replace every single part there is. 3. Ultimately, if the end result is you've replaced the entire station, then why not exploit the advance of technology to replace the entire station with something better? Doing this would require diverting resources away from the current station and into a new one.
Imagine the flow of water as a number of individual water molecules. If the gap is large, you can fit more molecules through it at once, but if it is small, you can only fit a few through at once. Therefore, to maintain the same flow rate, you need more molecules to pass through  the gap in a given time frame, hence it moves faster.
For example, if you went on a journey and you plotted the journey on a map. That line is a representation of the journey through space (ie along the map) but if you think about it, it also represents where you were at different points in time. It is equally true to say that the line represents your motion through time (as you were only at one point on the line at any moment in time during the journey)  We also see this in a lot of graphs and diagrams. For example, if you plot the population of a country over the years, it is a representation of population as one moves through time. These are very natural notions of "moving" through time that we encounter in everyday life.  In physics, the equations are more complicated but it is actually not much different than the examples I gave above. There are some non-intuitive ideas that take hold in physics when it comes to massive objects (high gravity) and very high velocities. In everyday life, we tend to think of time as "absolute" - everyone keeps the same clock. Einstein's theory and experiments show that moving through space actually affects movement through time. Time is observer dependent. Although a deeper exploration requires some college physics.
Technically, everything in orbit is being pulled down by gravity right now - they just have enough lateral motion to go around instead of colliding with thr Earth. So, the thing that would cause something to fall out of orbit is slowing down. Stuff at the height of most satellites experience a tiny amount of drag from the very top of the atmosphere, and will eventually slow down and crash within a hundred years or a little more.  Stuff that's orbiting far above the atmosphere, like some satellites, or the Moon, can stay in orbit for billions of years without being disturbed.
Atoms move in a lot of different ways. They can vibrate, spin, and move from one place to another. All of this movement contributes to this idea of a substance being hot or cold. If a material is hot, that means the atoms that make it up are vibrating, rotating, or moving vaster than if it is cold. But this idea of "hot" and "cold" isn't really a physical thing. What I mean is this. Atoms can move (as described). Movement is energy. Thus a moving atom has more energy than a not-moving atom. And an atom that is moving faster has more energy than an atom that is moving slower. We call this energy "heat." And we can convert heat into temperature. But what makes 40 degrees F "cold" and 100 degrees F "hot"? If I just invented a brand new temperature system and told you something was 800 degrees in this system, you wouldn't know if it was "hot" or "cold." And that's because "hot" and "cold" are sensations your brain comes up with. Something that has temperature touches your body and there is a transfer of energy (heat) which triggers different neurons in your skin that then transmit electro-chemical signals to your brain which then creates a sensation of "hot" or "cold." Why go down this rabbit hole? Because understanding this is the key to understanding why a wind might feel cold or hot. Something *feels* cold or hot not *just* because of its actual temperature but how it affects your body's ability to get rid of heat. Remember that humans are warm blooded animals and are always generating heat and need a way to get rid of that heat or we'll overheat and die. And this is important because wind has more energy than still air and should have a higher temperature, but wind feels cooler to you than still air. Paradox? No, because in still air, the air near your body is warmed up by your body then doesn't go anywhere. Once the air near your skin reaches the same temperature as your skin, your body can't get rid of any more heat so you start to heat up. Thus you feel "warm." But in windy air, the air near your skin is constantly being blown away and replaced with new air allowing your body to continually shed its heat and transfer it to this new air. Thus you feel "cool." So even though windy air can be hotter than still air, whether you feel cold or hot is also about how quickly (or slowly) your body can shed the heat it is constantly generating.
CIPM, which is the organization responsible for maintaining the SI units, has been undergoing an effort to redefine the SI units in accordance with fundamental properties of the universe. The metre was originally defined based off the circumference of the Earth, which works fine on Earth but if we ever colonize other planets, we need an absolute standard. In 1983 the standard of the metre was defined as "the distance travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299 792 458 of a second." Basically, we know the speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s, and we know it doesn't change, so now we define the distance of 1 metre off of the speed of light.
Imagine wearing gloves. You can feel things even though you never touch them, because the glove mediates the force between your hand and the object. With a thick glove, small variations in the surface are imperceptible. Bigger variations, though, can be easily felt. Textures are just variations in the surface finish, as well as variations in how the surface shape reacts to force. So, with thin enough gloves, you should be able to feel any texture. The 'glove' of intermolecular forces is a few nanometers thick.
The windshield isn't perfectly flat, it's curved, like a glass holding water, or like a lens.  And like a glass holding water or a lens, this makes light bend, so the road appears to bend when you look through this part of the windshield.
Light travels at that speed because it's the limit, not the other way around. Anything with no mass, and in particular any information about events of any kind, is limited by that speed, and light is just one example of that limit (because photons, the particles of light, are massless). Other massless phenomena, like gravitational waves, travel at the same speed as light. A more proper term might be "speed of causality" or "conversion factor between length and time".
