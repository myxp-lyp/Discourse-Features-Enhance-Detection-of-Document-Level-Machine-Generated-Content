In prediction tasks, outcomes with a natural order are often present and the input data can be a combination of complex data, such as images, and tabular predictors. While deep Learning (DL) methods have demonstrated excellent performance in classifying images, most models do not consider ordered outcomes as ordered and lack interpretability. On the other hand, traditional ordinal regression models provide interpretable predictor effects but are limited to tabular input data. In this study, we introduce the modular class of ordinal neural network transformation models (ontram s). These transformation models use a parametric transformation function and a simple distribution to balance the flexibility and interpretability of individual model components. In ontram s, this balance is achieved by decomposing the transformation function into terms for the tabular and image data through a set of jointly trained neural networks. We demonstrate that the most flexible ontram s achieve comparable performance with DL classifiers, while surpassing them in training speed. We also discuss how to interpret the components of ontram s in general and in the case of correlated tabular and image data. Overall, ontram s combine the advantages of DL and distributional regression to create interpretable prediction models for ordinal outcomes.
For a long time, Michael had dreamed of visiting Los Angeles. He eventually arranged a trip to the renowned city and, while there, he sampled the local cuisine and explored the museums. It was truly an unforgettable experience for him, and he is thrilled to have finally seen Los Angeles.
We put forth a framework for investigating the stability of discrete-event systems modelled as switching max-plus linear systems. We define a set of stability concepts for general discrete-event systems in the max-plus algebra within this framework. Then we demonstrate the loss of equivalence of these concepts for switching max-plus linear systems due to the lack of global monotonicity and the associated difficulty in rigorous analysis. This motivates us to relax the assumption on the monotonicity of the dynamics to positive invariance of max-plus cones. We then generalize these stability notions when the dynamics are confined to such cones. The stability analysis method presented in this paper represents a first step towards studying the stability of a broad category of switching max-plus linear systems.
The local football squad was trailing by a touchdown. Only seconds remained on the clock. Positioned far in their own territory, the team was at a disadvantage. In a last-ditch effort, the coach orchestrated a play. Miraculously, the Hail Mary pass succeeded, leading to a victory for the home team.
A deep learning-based MIMO receiver architecture, called DeepRx, is proposed, which combines a ResNet-based convolutional neural network with a transformation layer, outperforming conventional baseline receivers, especially with sparse pilot configurations.
Researchers at Zhejiang University in China have conducted experiments on groups of drones that can navigate independently through intricate surroundings. These drones have the ability to maneuver through dense bamboo forests while steering clear of other drones. Autonomous drone swarms have numerous uses, such as mapping out inaccessible areas during emergencies and transporting heavy objects. They also have potential military uses. It is expected that this technology will be put into practical use within the next few years. A video showcasing the drones flying through a bamboo forest can be viewed.
Comparing human language processing models has become a standard practice, which involves using participant feedback, such as reading times, on corpora filled with comprehensive and naturalistic linguistic content. However, the naturalistic texts typically used in these studies often lack the infrequent syntactic structures essential for distinguishing between various processing theories. In our presentation, we introduce a newly compiled corpus of English, meticulously crafted to include a variety of these rare syntactic forms while maintaining fluency for native speakers. This corpus is complemented with meticulously revised parse trees and incorporates data on self-paced reading times. We provide a summary of the corpus's contents and make the data available. 1 footnote 1 1 footnote 1 You can access this corpus, which is shared under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) license.

Massive MIMO is considered a key factor in enabling low-latency communication, thanks to its high spatial degrees of freedom. The channel hardening and favorable propagation properties of Massive MIMO are crucial for multiplexing multiple URLLC devices. However, the accuracy of channel knowledge is crucial for the actual usefulness of channel hardening and spatial multiplexing. When multiplexing several low-latency devices, the cost of obtaining accurate knowledge becomes critical, and it is unclear how many devices can be served with a latency-reliability requirement and how many pilot symbols should be allocated. This study examines the balance between achieving high spectral efficiency and high reliability in the downlink, using various power allocation strategies for maximum ratio and minimum mean square error precoders. The findings indicate that using max-min SINR power allocation provides the best reliability, but at the cost of lower overall spectral efficiency.
Calculating probabilities solely based on the entropy of a signal or process does not have a simple analytical equation or quick method. Unless there are restrictions on the state probabilities, the underlying probabilities usually need to be determined through search algorithms. As the investigation of higher order entropies increases, these algorithms become more computationally intensive. This paper explains a method for calculating a joint probability matrix based on entropy for any order. This method only requires successfully calculating first order entropies, while the others are derived through multiplicative cascades.

We have developed techniques for serializing and deserializing tree ensembles that optimize inference latency when models are not already stored in memory. This is relevant in situations where models are larger than memory, but also when models are deployed on low-resource devices, such as in the Internet of Things, or run as Web micro-services where resources are allocated on demand. Our packed serialized trees (PACSET) leverage principles from external memory algorithms to encode reference locality in the layout of a tree ensemble. The layout combines correlated nodes across multiple trees, places nodes on the most popular paths based on leaf cardinality, and is optimized for the IO blocksize. As a result, each IO operation yields a higher fraction of useful data, resulting in a 2-6 times reduction in classification latency for interactive workloads.

The PSG token was developed to help PSG build a new fan community.
We extend the concepts of singularities and regular points from linear ordinary differential equations to D-finite systems. Regular points of a D-finite system are defined using its formal power series solutions. We also demonstrate that apparent singularities can be eliminated, just like in the univariate case, by adding appropriate extra solutions to the system. Several techniques are offered for identifying and removing apparent singularities. Furthermore, a method is provided for computing formal power series solutions of a D-finite system at apparent singularities.

As Lenny strolled by the holly tree in his yard, he heard chirping. He glanced down and noticed a baby bird on the ground. He gently picked it up and put it in the nest with the other two. Lenny was concerned that the mother bird would reject the baby. But soon after, she returned with worms and fed all three of them.
Scientists have verified that musk ducks indeed displayed mimicry in sound recordings from 1987 and 2000. These instances marked the first recorded evidence of musk ducks mimicking other sounds. The process, known as vocal-production learning, involves animals producing calls that greatly differ from their species' norm or replicate noises from other species. This ability has been noted in only a few select animal groups. The musk duck's capacity for complex vocal learning may be on par with that of songbirds and parrots, suggesting an example of evolutionary development occurring separately.
A facility in the Japanese city of Abiko hosted the unveiling of a flying car developed by NEC. During two brief demonstrations, the vehicle was able to hover steadily for approximately a minute using its four propellers. Japan has set a goal of using flying cars by 2030 to connect islands in the Mie resort area, while Dubai is also actively pursuing this technology. Flying cars are defined as electric or hybrid electric aircraft with driverless capabilities and the ability to take off and land vertically. They are also referred to as EVtol, electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. Compared to helicopters, they have lower maintenance costs, produce less noise, and do not
The children were feeling uninterested. Their mother suggested they watch a movie. When they took a DVD out of the cabinet, they found it was too scratched to use. This left the kids feeling annoyed.
A flying vehicle presented by NEC in Abiko managed to hover using its quad propellers for around 60 seconds in a couple of test runs. Japan has set its sights on integrating flying cars by 2030 to serve the islands in the Mie tourist region, and Dubai is similarly advancing in this field. These flying cars, also referred to as EVtol (electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft), are characterized as electric or hybrid-electric aircraft equipped with autonomous navigation systems and the capability for vertical takeoffs and landings. When compared to helicopters, they offer advantages such as lower maintenance costs, quieter operation, and no need for licensed pilots. Uber is venturing into this area as well with Uber Air, commencing test flights in 2020 and aiming for commercial service launch in 2023.
