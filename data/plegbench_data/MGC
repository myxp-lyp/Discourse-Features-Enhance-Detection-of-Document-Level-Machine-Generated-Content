MTMCT systems are used to track targets across multiple cameras, and they typically limit their data association to a local neighborhood in order to ensure the continuity of target trajectories. In single camera tracking, the local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames, while in multi-camera tracking, it refers to neighboring cameras where the target may appear in succession. These tracking systems often use appearance features learned from a re-identification (re-ID) perspective for similarity estimation. Unlike tracking, re-ID does not have access to trajectory cues and requires learning global appearance features for matching. The discrepancy between the local matching process in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may impact the performance of MTMCT. To address this, we propose the use of a locality aware appearance metric (LAAM) to fit the local matching process in MTMCT. This includes designing an intra-camera metric for single camera tracking and an inter-camera metric for multi-camera tracking, both trained with data pairs sampled from their corresponding local neighborhoods. We demonstrate that these locally learned metrics can effectively complement globally learned re-ID features. With this approach, we have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the DukeMTMC dataset and a significant improvement on the CityFlow dataset.
The increasing prevalence of location-based methods and applications in emerging wireless networks has made the verification of location information increasingly important. This has resulted in a surge of research activity in recent years related to location verification techniques in wireless networks, with a specific emphasis on Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS).

This study examines recent research on wireless location verification in the context of vehicular networks, particularly focusing on systems that use formal mathematical classification frameworks, demonstrating how many systems are either partially or fully covered by such frameworks.
In prediction tasks, outcomes with a natural order are often present and the input data can be a combination of complex data, such as images, and tabular predictors. While deep Learning (DL) methods have demonstrated excellent performance in classifying images, most models do not consider ordered outcomes as ordered and lack interpretability. On the other hand, traditional ordinal regression models provide interpretable predictor effects but are limited to tabular input data. In this study, we introduce the modular class of ordinal neural network transformation models (ontram s). These transformation models use a parametric transformation function and a simple distribution to balance the flexibility and interpretability of individual model components. In ontram s, this balance is achieved by decomposing the transformation function into terms for the tabular and image data through a set of jointly trained neural networks. We demonstrate that the most flexible ontram s achieve comparable performance with DL classifiers, while surpassing them in training speed. We also discuss how to interpret the components of ontram s in general and in the case of correlated tabular and image data. Overall, ontram s combine the advantages of DL and distributional regression to create interpretable prediction models for ordinal outcomes.

The results also demonstrate the potential for transferring learning from one target flow shape to another for a generic design of flow shape.
Research interest in multispectral pedestrian detection has grown due to its critical importance in various applications, especially under low light conditions. A human baseline was established using the KAIST dataset, revealing a substantial gap between current top detectors and human performance. To narrow this gap, a network fusion architecture is proposed, which includes a multispectral proposal network and a subsequent multispectral classification network. This unified network is trained to optimize pedestrian detection and semantic segmentation tasks. The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the KAIST dataset while remaining efficient. In addition, sanitized training annotations for the KAIST dataset are provided, and the impact of different types of annotation errors is examined, offering potential for further research in the field.
The issue of anonymous broadcast, where one or more parties want to send messages to all parties anonymously, is increasingly important in various privacy-preserving applications. This includes tasks such as anonymous communication, distributed auctions, and multi-party computation. In this article, we propose decentralized protocols for anonymous broadcast that only require each party to send (and compute) a polylogarithmic number of bits (and operations) for each anonymous bit delivered, with O(log n) rounds of communication. Our protocol is designed to be secure against traffic analysis, does not rely on any trusted party, and distributes the load evenly. It can tolerate up to n 6 statically-scheduled Byzantine parties controlled by a computationally unbounded adversary. Our main strategy for achieving scalability is to enable local communications (and computations) among a logarithmic number of parties. We also present simulation results demonstrating the significant improvement of our protocol over previous approaches. Lastly, we demonstrate that by utilizing a common cryptographic tool, our protocol can achieve practical results for anonymous broadcast.
The Count-Min sketch is a well-researched method for summarizing data. It allows for estimating the count of any item in a stream using a small, fixed-size data sketch. However, the accuracy of the sketch depends on the characteristics of the underlying data, leading to different count estimation procedures that perform well in some scenarios but poorly in others. This presents practitioners with two fundamental, unanswered questions: which variant should be chosen when the data is unknown, and is the error of a given estimate sufficiently small to be reliable? Our research addresses these questions by introducing new count estimators, including an optimal estimator that either outperforms or matches previous estimators in all scenarios. We also provide tight error bounds at query time for both new and existing estimators. These error estimates also help in choosing the optimal tuning parameters for the sketch, as they can predict the error for different choices of sketch width and depth. The key insight is that the error distribution in each counter can be empirically estimated from the sketch itself. By estimating this distribution, count estimation becomes a statistical estimation and inference problem with a known error distribution, providing a principled way to derive new and optimal estimators as well as to study the error and properties of existing estimators.
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has become the standard method for non-invasive assessment of cardiac function, allowing for precise measurement of functional parameters such as chamber volumes and ejection fraction. Deep learning has the potential to automate the segmentation of cardiac structures, but the lack of robustness in deep learning models has limited their widespread use in clinical settings. Neural networks trained on data from one scanner may not perform well on data from a different scanner due to differences in data characteristics. In this study, we propose a solution to this problem using domain-adversarial learning to train a domain-invariant 2D U-Net using both labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach demonstrates improved performance compared to standard training when evaluated on data from both familiar and unfamiliar domains, and we also demonstrate that the domain information cannot be recovered from the learned features.
We introduce techniques for serializing and deserializing tree ensembles in order to optimize inference speed when models are not already loaded into memory. This is particularly useful when models are too large to fit into memory, as well as in situations where models are deployed on low-resource devices like Internet of Things devices or run as Web micro-services with resources allocated on demand. Our packed serialized trees (PACSET) encode reference locality in the organization of a tree ensemble using principles from external memory algorithms. The organization interweaves related nodes across multiple trees, uses leaf cardinality to group the nodes on the most common paths, and is optimized for the IO blocksize. The result is that each IO operation produces a higher percentage of useful data, resulting in a 2-6 times reduction in classification latency for interactive workloads.
The classic problem of Fourier phase retrieval involves reconstructing an image from the amplitude measurements of its Fourier coefficients. Traditional approaches to this problem involve iterative minimization, utilizing prior knowledge of the image's structure. Ambiguities in the Fourier measurements, such as shifts and flips, make this problem challenging, and many existing methods employ multiple random restarts with different permutations. In this study, we introduce the idea of adding a known reference to the signal before capturing the Fourier amplitude measurements, inspired by holography. Our approach involves using an iterative phase retrieval method as an unrolled network and using back propagation to learn the reference for optimal signal reconstruction. Through simulations on various datasets under different conditions, we found that our proposed method achieves near-perfect recovery at a low computational cost. When compared to standard Fourier phase retrieval methods, our approach using the learned reference demonstrates significant performance improvement. Our code is available for access.
Massive MIMO is considered a key factor in enabling low-latency communication, thanks to its high spatial degrees of freedom. The channel hardening and favorable propagation properties of Massive MIMO are crucial for multiplexing multiple URLLC devices. However, the accuracy of channel knowledge is crucial for the actual usefulness of channel hardening and spatial multiplexing. When multiplexing several low-latency devices, the cost of obtaining accurate knowledge becomes critical, and it is unclear how many devices can be served with a latency-reliability requirement and how many pilot symbols should be allocated. This study examines the balance between achieving high spectral efficiency and high reliability in the downlink, using various power allocation strategies for maximum ratio and minimum mean square error precoders. The findings indicate that using max-min SINR power allocation provides the best reliability, but at the cost of lower overall spectral efficiency.
Calculating probabilities solely based on the entropy of a signal or process does not have a simple analytical equation or quick method. Unless there are restrictions on the state probabilities, the underlying probabilities usually need to be determined through search algorithms. As the investigation of higher order entropies increases, these algorithms become more computationally intensive. This paper explains a method for calculating a joint probability matrix based on entropy for any order. This method only requires successfully calculating first order entropies, while the others are derived through multiplicative cascades.
We introduce a new method for applying makeup to a face image using other images as style references. Our approach mimics physical makeup by adjusting color and skin details while preserving the structure of the face. First, we extract the foreground from both the subject and multiple example images, and then use image matting algorithms to extract semantic information such as faces, lips, teeth, eyes, eyebrows, etc. Once the semantic information is extracted, we transfer the makeup style between corresponding parts. The final step involves seamlessly blending different parts together using alpha blending and optimizing the color consistency of a collection of images. Our method has the advantage of not requiring face matching and can utilize multiple example images to fulfill user requirements. Additionally, it is not limited to head shot images and can handle makeup style changes in different scenarios without the need for the same pose or image size. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in faithfully transferring makeup.
In single image super-resolution based on machine learning, the degradation model is incorporated into the generation of training data. However, current methods for super-resolution of satellite images mostly use a basic down-sampling model with a fixed kernel to generate training images. While these methods work well with artificial data, they do not perform effectively with actual satellite images. Our solution involves creating a more realistic model for generating training data using commercial satellite imagery products, taking into account both the satellite imaging process and post-processing on the ground. We also propose a convolutional neural network specifically optimized for satellite images. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed training data generation model enhances the performance of super-resolution on real satellite images.
Despite advancements in semantic segmentation, the field of medical ultra-resolution image segmentation still faces significant challenges. Approaches based on a multi-branch structure can strike a balance between computational workload and segmentation accuracy. However, the fusion structure in these methods must be carefully designed to achieve the desired results, leading to model redundancy. This paper introduces the Meta Segmentation Network (MSN) to address this challenging problem. By utilizing meta-learning, the fusion module of MSN is simple yet effective. MSN can quickly generate fusion layer weights through a simple meta-learner, requiring minimal training samples and epochs to converge. Additionally, to avoid training all branches from scratch, a specific weight-sharing mechanism is introduced to achieve rapid knowledge adaptation and share weights among multiple branches, resulting in improved performance and reduced parameters. Experimental results on the BACH and ISIC medical datasets demonstrate that MSN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
Contemporary frameworks for object detection predominantly use bounding box regression to pinpoint object locations. Yet, despite advances in recent times, the accuracy of bounding box regression is not thoroughly satisfying, which restricts the capabilities of object detection systems. It's noted that exact placement of a bounding box's edges is essential for accurate localization. Contrarily, the prevalent method focusing on predicting object centers and sizes doesn't effectively achieve this task, particularly in scenarios where there is a significant disparity between the anchor points and the actual targets. In our study, we introduce a new methodology called Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), wherein a specialized network branch is dedicated to localizing each side of the bounding box. Furthermore, to overcome the challenge of achieving precise localization amidst large variations in displacement, we also present a two-phased localization technique. This technique initially forecasts a potential movement range using bucket prediction and subsequently, narrows down to the exact location within the foreseen range. We have validated our methodology on both dual-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. By integrating our proposed structure in place of the conventional bounding box regression branches, there have been notable upgrades in the performance of Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, with improvements of 3.0, 1.6, and 0.9 points, respectively. The code and models will be made accessible for further review and use.
LIDAR (light detection and ranging) is a technology that uses light to measure the distance and reflectivity between a sensor and an object. Historically, LIDAR-generated data has become the go-to for creating Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), which are essential in applications such as extracting roads, hydrological studies, flood mapping, and analyzing surfaces. Studies related to flooding highlight that using high-resolution DEMs can significantly enhance the precision and dependability of these applications. Yet, obtaining high-resolution DEMs remains a challenge across many regions within the US and globally, often due to the high cost and technological barriers associated with data collection. Fortunately, advancements in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and innovative algorithms have made deep learning an attractive option for researchers, especially for analyzing high-resolution data. Cutting-edge methods, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have been introduced to create smart models capable of correcting and enhancing large datasets. In this research, we propose a model using a GAN inspired by single image super-resolution techniques that is capable of quadrupling the spatial resolution of an existing DEM dataset, without needing any extra information.
The pursuit of scientific inquiry advances public health, yet active efforts to block research have hindered scientists from collecting even the basic data necessary to tackle the gun violence crisis in the United States. Despite the absence of federal funding, there is an abundance of accessible public data that can enable scientists to analyze various firearm-related activities. The diversity of data sources available 芒鈧鈥 such as journalistic reports, social networks, online forums, digital advertising, and web searches, among others 芒鈧鈥 presents numerous chances for scientists to explore aspects ranging from gun violence tendencies to firearm-related actions (like buying habits and safety measures) to the public's perception and attitude towards initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence. The role of science has been marginalized in the conversation on gun violence for far too long. It is imperative for scientists to leverage the vast amount of data available through various media channels to help address this urgent issue.
Bayesian optimization (BO) is an effective strategy for identifying the global maximum of costly black-box functions and has been notably successful in optimizing the hyper-parameters for machine learning algorithms. This process entails creating a predictive model of the function and optimizing a criterion to determine which data points to explore next. However, the complexity increases exponentially with the number of dimensions, making it impractical for BO to handle more than 10-20 variables. To overcome this limitation, our research presents a novel approach for high-dimensional BO that discovers a non-linear, lower-dimensional representation of the input space through a multi-layer neural network integrated within the Gaussian process's covariance function. This technique incorporates unsupervised learning for dimension reduction as part of the supervised regression, and leverages the data efficiency inherent in Gaussian process models within a Bayesian setting. Additionally, we developed a non-linear projection from the reduced manifold back to the original high-dimensional space using multi-output Gaussian processes, and we train this system in its entirety through marginal likelihood maximization. Our approach, which inherently operates on low-dimensional assumptions, demonstrates superior performance over recent standards in the field of high-dimensional BO, as evidenced by benchmark testing on functions with up to 60 dimensions.
Our research extends the concept of total variation noise reduction from images to Cartesian power graphs and its use in inferring non-parametric network models. The method known as power graph fused lasso (PGFL) analyzes a matrix by leveraging an established graph structure, G, which influences both the rows and the columns. Our primary findings suggest that the PGFL, in the presence of subGaussian noise and for any connected graph, can achieve a mean-square error rate comparable to that of 2D total variation denoising for bounded variation signals. We explore the application of the PGFL in the denoising of an observed network H, learning the graph G through the K-nearest neighborhood graph based on an estimated metric for the vertices. Theoretical and practical results we've attained in estimating graphons, which are non-parametric exchangeable network models, are presented, and we benchmark these against current advanced graphon estimation techniques.
Our study investigates the efficacy of TCP as well as TCP with network coding (TCPNC) within networks experiencing data loss. We build on the foundational work by Padhye et al. to describe how the throughput of traditional TCP and TCPNC correlates with factors such as loss likelihood, round-trip timing, the maximum size of the data window, and the length of the connection. The analytical findings indicate that network coding conceals random data loss from TCP, thereby safeguarding the protocol from performance drops in unreliable networks. Moreover, TCPNC demonstrates a considerable advantage in throughput compared to standard TCP. Additionally, our results suggest that TCPNC could lead to savings for wireless network providers, while still delivering a reliable level of service to customers. We assess cost through the number of base stations, which closely relates to the energy, capital, and operational expenses of network providers. We demonstrate that merely increasing bandwidth does not guarantee a boost in throughput, especially in lossy networks where TCP struggles. Instead, the deployment of protocols like TCPNC, which are better at handling data loss, can achieve throughput that is proportional to the bandwidth allocated to each user.
The manuscript details the effects of applying quantization on how efficiently multi-class text classification is conducted during a support vector machine's (SVM) training phase. It compares the effectiveness of an SVM model trained with reduced precision to one in its standard form. The primary benefit of quantization is a reduction in both the computation time and the memory usage on a hardware platform designed for low-precision operations, such as 16-bit GPUs or FPGAs of any bit-width. The document outlines how reducing precision in the SVM's training impacts the accuracy of text classification. The CPU-based implementation was done via the OpenMP library, and it also showcases the GPU implementation results at double, single, and half-precision levels.
Comparing human language processing models has become a standard practice, which involves using participant feedback, such as reading times, on corpora filled with comprehensive and naturalistic linguistic content. However, the naturalistic texts typically used in these studies often lack the infrequent syntactic structures essential for distinguishing between various processing theories. In our presentation, we introduce a newly compiled corpus of English, meticulously crafted to include a variety of these rare syntactic forms while maintaining fluency for native speakers. This corpus is complemented with meticulously revised parse trees and incorporates data on self-paced reading times. We provide a summary of the corpus's contents and make the data available. 1 footnote 1 1 footnote 1 You can access this corpus, which is shared under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) license.

The concept of isospectral flows encompasses a broad spectrum of continuous dynamic systems, including those that are integrable and those with Lie-Poisson structures. Numerical analysis traditionally grapples with their discretization. To maintain the spectra in the discrete counterpart, one must ensure the persistence of advanced order polynomials, which is seldom achieved. Common methods that intend to do this are often complex and do not successfully retain the inherent Lie-Poisson framework. In this paper, we introduce a new classification of numerical methods of any desired order for both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian isospectral flows. Remarkably, these methods are uncomplicated, maintain the spectra and Lie-Poisson structure, and do not rely on constraints or exponential mapping. Additionally, the preservation of Lie-Poisson structure enables them to nearly conserve the Hamiltonian function. We demonstrate the application of these methods on a variety of well-known isospectral flows to highlight their effectiveness. Keywords: isospectral flow, Lie-Poisson integrator, symplectic Runge-Kutta methods, Toda flow, generalized rigid body, Chu's flow, Bloch-Iserles flow, Euler equations, point-vortices MSC 2010: 37M15, 65P10, 37J15, 53D20, 70H06
While recent advancements have been made in semantic segmentation, substantial difficulties remain in segmenting medical images of ultra-high resolution. Strategies using a multi-branch infrastructure strike an effective balance between computational demands and precision in segmentation. Yet these techniques necessitate careful design in their fusion processes to reach optimal outcomes, often leading to an excess in model complexity. In our study, we introduce the Meta Segmentation Network (MSN) to address this difficult issue. Leveraging meta-learning, MSN's fusion component is straightforward yet impactful. The network quickly derives the weights for the fusion layers using a basic meta-learner, which achieves convergence with minimal training examples and epochs. To prevent the necessity of developing each branch from the ground up, we also incorporate a unique weight-sharing strategy. This approach enables rapid knowledge transfer and weight distribution across multiple branches, enhancing overall performance and significantly reducing the number of parameters. Our testing on two complex ultra-resolution medical datasets, BACH and ISIC, demonstrates that MSN outperforms leading-edge methods.

The concepts of singularities and regular points are expanded from linear ordinary differential equations to D-finite systems. For a D-finite system, regular points are defined by the formal power series solutions it yields. It is also demonstrated that apparent singularities can be eliminated in a manner analogous to the univariate scenario by incorporating proper extra solutions into the current system. We discuss a number of algorithms for identifying and eliminating apparent singularities. Furthermore, an algorithm is provided to compute the formal power series solutions for a D-finite system at points where singularities appear to be present.
The primary goal of this research is to establish a framework for logical inference concerning distributed time-stamped allegations.

We present the Time-Stamped Claim Logic, complete with a robust and comprehensive sequent calculus that aids in condensing the evidence corpus and rectifying inconsistencies. Thus, the logic guarantees outcomes that align with the established trust hierarchies. To demonstrate the practical application of Time-Stamped Claim Logic, we analyze an actual cyber-attribution scenario.

To enhance recognition accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, various limitations within the recognition process have been considered, including network architecture, the number of inputs (with additional inputs enriching the color data), and optimization of the loss function, among others. The standard approach in the field has been to train networks to classify all the action categories in a given dataset. However, we suggest training an array of specialized networks instead, with each one designed to identify a subset of action categories. Our approach involves a novel optimized system that relies on dissimilarity for assigning action categories across these specialized networks, which can be trained simultaneously in an offline setting. Using two benchmark datasets, UCF-101 and HMDB-51, our strategy showcases equal or better performance in some respects compared to current leading methods, while adhering to real-time processing requirements. On the notably difficult HMDB-51 dataset, we achieved 72.5% accuracy. By allocating fewer and distinct classes to each module network, our research demonstrates how to utilize more efficient architectures without losing out on accuracy. An initial version of this study has been previously published.
In the last ten years, there has been extraordinary progress in the fields of artificial intelligence and photonic technologies, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with today's computing hardware. This study synthesizes cutting-edge advancements in both areas through the lens of reinforcement learning. We introduce a design for a photonic-based active learning machine that employs modern algorithms like SARSA, Q-learning, and projective simulation. Our numerical analysis of its effectiveness in common reinforcement learning scenarios indicates that it can tolerate or even benefit from a realistic degree of experimental noise. Notably, this architecture facilitates abstraction and generalization, two elements commonly deemed crucial to artificial intelligence. The suggested system, which utilizes single-photon travel through an adjustable mesh of beamsplitters, is straightforward, expandable, and its adoption in compact devices may soon be achievable with emerging technologies.
Microfluidic devices control flow behavior in various applications, including medical diagnostics. Inertial microfluidic flow sculpting involves placing pillars to deform an initial flow field into a desired one, which can be defined as an inverse problem. This problem can be solved using Reinforcement Learning (RL) by training a DoubleDQN agent, resulting in successful learning with a 90% success rate in 200,000 episodes and converging rewards. The agent can also transfer learning from one target shape to another, making it useful for generic flow shape design.
Architectural design experience is captured by architecture patterns, which offer general solutions to frequently encountered architectural design issues. They specify the types of components and constrain how they can be connected and activated, ensuring that the resulting architectures have certain desirable characteristics. Unfortunately, most documented patterns do not offer a formal guarantee that their specifications will result in the promised guarantees. This could result in inappropriate architectures芒鈧鈥漣.e., architectures mistakenly believed to exhibit certain desirable traits. Since architectures have a significant impact on a system's quality and fixing architectural flaws is challenging, if not impossible, this could result in severe and irreparable quality issues in the final product. To address this issue, we suggest a model-checking-based technique to confirm that pattern specifications match their guarantees. We use the technique on three well-known dynamic architecture patterns芒鈧鈥漷he Singleton, the Model-View-Controller, and the Broker pattern芒鈧鈥漚nd discover ambiguities and missing constraints in all three specifications. As a result, we conclude that using model checking to validate dynamic architecture patterns is both practical and beneficial for discovering flaws and ambiguities in pattern specific
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has become the gold standard for non-invasively assessing cardiac function, allowing for precise quantification of functional parameters such as chamber volumes and ejection fraction. Deep learning models have demonstrated potential in automating the necessary cardiac structure segmentation, but their lack of robustness has limited their widespread clinical adoption. Since neural networks trained on data from a specific scanner may not generalize well to data acquired at a different center or with a different scanner due to differences in data characteristics, we propose a principled solution to address this domain shift problem. By utilizing domain-adversarial learning, we train a domain-invariant 2D U-Net with labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach is evaluated on both seen and unseen domains from the MMs challenge dataset, and the domain-adversarial approach shows improved performance compared to standard training. Moreover, we demonstrate that the domain information cannot be recovered from the learned features.
In anonymous broadcasting, one or more parties wish to send messages anonymously to all parties. This issue is becoming increasingly crucial as a black-box in various privacy-preserving applications, such as anonymous communication, distributed auctions, and multi-party computation. In this study, we create decentralized protocols for anonymous broadcast that require each party to transmit and process a polylogarithmic number of bits and operations per anonymous bit delivered with O (log n) rounds of communication. Our protocol is secure against traffic analysis, does not rely on any trusted party, and is completely load-balanced. The protocol can handle up to n 6 statically-scheduled Byzantine parties that are controlled by a computationally unbounded adversary. Our main strategy for achieving scalability is to perform local communications and computations among a logarithmic number of parties. We provide simulation results that demonstrate our protocol's significant improvement over previous work. Finally, we show that using a common cryptographic tool in our protocol can achieve practical results for anonymous broadcast.
The research community has become increasingly interested in multispectral pedestrian detection due to its importance for various around-the-clock applications (e.g., video surveillance and autonomous driving), particularly under low-light conditions. We create a human baseline over the KAIST dataset and demonstrate that there is still a significant gap between the current top detectors and human performance. To reduce this gap, we propose a network fusion architecture that consists of a multispectral proposal network for generating pedestrian proposals and a subsequent multispectral classification network for distinguishing pedestrian instances from hard negatives. The unified network is trained by jointly optimizing pedestrian detection and semantic segmentation tasks. The final detections are obtained by combining the outputs from different modalities and the two stages. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the KAIST dataset while maintaining speed. Additionally, we provide a sanitized version of the training annotations for the KAIST dataset and investigate the effects of different types of annotation errors. Future research on this problem will benefit from the sanitized version, which eliminates the interference of annotation errors.
A deep learning-based MIMO receiver architecture, called DeepRx, is proposed, which combines a ResNet-based convolutional neural network with a transformation layer, outperforming conventional baseline receivers, especially with sparse pilot configurations.
Keypoint-based methods represent a fresh approach to object detection, dispensing with anchor boxes and streamlining the detection process. CornerNet, which relies on keypoints, achieves top-notch accuracy among single-stage detectors. However, this accuracy comes at a high computational cost. In this study, we aim to improve the efficiency of keypoint-based object detection and introduce CornerNet-Lite. CornerNet-Lite combines two efficient versions of CornerNet: CornerNet-Saccade, which employs an attention mechanism to avoid processing every pixel in the image, and CornerNet-Squeeze, which features a new compact backbone architecture. These two variants address two crucial scenarios in efficient object detection: maintaining accuracy while enhancing efficiency, and improving accuracy at real-time efficiency. CornerNet-Saccade is suitable for offline processing and boosts CornerNet's efficiency by 6.0x while improving AP by 1.0 on COCO. CornerNet-Squeeze is designed for real-time detection, surpassing YOLOv3 (34.4
1 1 footnote 1 The code is available at State-of-the-art pedestrian detection models have achieved great success in many benchmarks. However, these models require lots of annotation information and the labeling process usually takes much time and efforts. In this paper, we propose a method to generate labeled pedestrian data and adopt them to support the training of pedestrian detectors. Our proposed framework is built on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with multiple discriminators, trying to synthesize realistic pedestrians and learn the background context simultaneously. To handle the pedestrians of different sizes, we adopt the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer in the discriminator. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks. The results show that our framework can smoothly synthesize pedestrians on background images of variations and different levels of details. To quantitatively evaluate our approach, we add the generated samples into training data of the baseline pedestrian detectors and show the synthetic images are able to improve the detectors' performance.
We put forth a framework for investigating the stability of discrete-event systems modelled as switching max-plus linear systems. We define a set of stability concepts for general discrete-event systems in the max-plus algebra within this framework. Then we demonstrate the loss of equivalence of these concepts for switching max-plus linear systems due to the lack of global monotonicity and the associated difficulty in rigorous analysis. This motivates us to relax the assumption on the monotonicity of the dynamics to positive invariance of max-plus cones. We then generalize these stability notions when the dynamics are confined to such cones. The stability analysis method presented in this paper represents a first step towards studying the stability of a broad category of switching max-plus linear systems.
We have developed techniques for serializing and deserializing tree ensembles that optimize inference latency when models are not already stored in memory. This is relevant in situations where models are larger than memory, but also when models are deployed on low-resource devices, such as in the Internet of Things, or run as Web micro-services where resources are allocated on demand. Our packed serialized trees (PACSET) leverage principles from external memory algorithms to encode reference locality in the layout of a tree ensemble. The layout combines correlated nodes across multiple trees, places nodes on the most popular paths based on leaf cardinality, and is optimized for the IO blocksize. As a result, each IO operation yields a higher fraction of useful data, resulting in a 2-6 times reduction in classification latency for interactive workloads.
We extend the concepts of singularities and regular points from linear ordinary differential equations to D-finite systems. Regular points of a D-finite system are defined using its formal power series solutions. We also demonstrate that apparent singularities can be eliminated, just like in the univariate case, by adding appropriate extra solutions to the system. Several techniques are offered for identifying and removing apparent singularities. Furthermore, a method is provided for computing formal power series solutions of a D-finite system at apparent singularities.
Massive MIMO is a crucial factor in low-latency communications, thanks to its high spatial degrees of freedom. The channel hardening and favorable propagation properties of Massive MIMO are particularly important for multiplexing several URLLC devices. However, the actual utility of channel hardening and spatial multiplexing is dependent critically on the accuracy of channel knowledge. When several low-latency devices are multiplexed, the cost for acquiring accurate knowledge becomes critical, and it is not evident how many devices can be served with a latency-reliability requirement and how many pilot symbols should be allocated. This paper investigates the trade-off between achieving high spectral efficiency and high reliability in the downlink, by employing various power allocation strategies, for maximum ratio and minimum mean square error precoders. The results show that using max-min SINR power allocation achieves the best reliability, at the expense of lower sum spectral efficiency.
Process mining techniques aim to extract insights from event logs about how things are done. When applied to data from smart home environments, process mining has the potential to provide valuable insights into both healthy and unhealthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions. However, the events recorded in smart home environments are on the level of sensor triggers, which causes process discovery algorithms to produce overly general process models that allow for too much behavior and are difficult for human experts to interpret. We demonstrate that raising the level of event interpretation can enable the discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models. We present a framework for feature extraction that can be used for abstraction with supervised learning methods and is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. This framework can automatically abstract sensor-level events to their interpretation at the human activity level after being trained on training data that includes both the sensor and human activity events. Our abstraction framework is demonstrated on three real-life smart home event logs, and the results show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction are indeed more precise.
We explore a fresh strategy for covertly introducing backdoors into machine learning models by tampering with the loss calculation in the training code. The attacker is unable to change the training data, watch the code's execution, or access the finished model because our attack is blind. We create a novel method for covert backdoor training that uses multi-objective optimization to achieve high accuracy on both the primary and backdoor tasks while avoiding all known defenses. We then show the efficacy of the blind attack by introducing new, more potent backdoor classes than those in earlier literature, including single-pixel backdoors in ImageNet models, backdoors that change the model's task, and backdoors that don't require input changes during inference. Finally, we address potential defenses.
There is no straightforward analytical formula or rapid technique to determine probabilities solely based on a signal or process's entropy. One needs to determine the underlying probabilities through search methods, which become increasingly computationally costly as the entropy increases. This paper presents a method for calculating a joint probability matrix from the entropy for any order. With this technique, only the first-order entropies need to be calculated; the others can be derived through multiplicative cascades.

Studying and improving nanoscale devices can be challenging due to their small size and inability to reflect enough light for clear viewing. However, researchers at UC Riverside have developed a device that uses a tungsten lamp to produce color imaging at an unprecedented level by focusing light into a 6-nanometer spot at the end of a silver nanowire. This system can record changes in beam shape and color as the nanowire's tip moves over objects, and it can even create color photos of carbon nanotubes. This technology has the potential to significantly impact the development of more uniform nanomaterials and improve areas of research that have previously lacked such high resolution.
A decade ago, conservationists began using helicopters to relocate rhinos between remote areas inaccessible by road. The rhinos are transported upside down as it is a quicker, more convenient, and cost-effective method than using stretchers. Additionally, it is better for the rhinos' well-being, as being transported in this position allows for their spines to stretch, opening up their airways, and the sedation process is shorter. There are images of rhinos being airlifted available for viewing.

Scientists have verified that musk ducks indeed displayed mimicry in sound recordings from 1987 and 2000. These instances marked the first recorded evidence of musk ducks mimicking other sounds. The process, known as vocal-production learning, involves animals producing calls that greatly differ from their species' norm or replicate noises from other species. This ability has been noted in only a few select animal groups. The musk duck's capacity for complex vocal learning may be on par with that of songbirds and parrots, suggesting an example of evolutionary development occurring separately.
