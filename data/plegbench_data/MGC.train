Contemporary frameworks for object detection predominantly use bounding box regression to pinpoint object locations. Yet, despite advances in recent times, the accuracy of bounding box regression is not thoroughly satisfying, which restricts the capabilities of object detection systems. It's noted that exact placement of a bounding box's edges is essential for accurate localization. Contrarily, the prevalent method focusing on predicting object centers and sizes doesn't effectively achieve this task, particularly in scenarios where there is a significant disparity between the anchor points and the actual targets. In our study, we introduce a new methodology called Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), wherein a specialized network branch is dedicated to localizing each side of the bounding box. Furthermore, to overcome the challenge of achieving precise localization amidst large variations in displacement, we also present a two-phased localization technique. This technique initially forecasts a potential movement range using bucket prediction and subsequently, narrows down to the exact location within the foreseen range. We have validated our methodology on both dual-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. By integrating our proposed structure in place of the conventional bounding box regression branches, there have been notable upgrades in the performance of Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, with improvements of 3.0, 1.6, and 0.9 points, respectively. The code and models will be made accessible for further review and use.
Our research extends the concept of total variation noise reduction from images to Cartesian power graphs and its use in inferring non-parametric network models. The method known as power graph fused lasso (PGFL) analyzes a matrix by leveraging an established graph structure, G, which influences both the rows and the columns. Our primary findings suggest that the PGFL, in the presence of subGaussian noise and for any connected graph, can achieve a mean-square error rate comparable to that of 2D total variation denoising for bounded variation signals. We explore the application of the PGFL in the denoising of an observed network H, learning the graph G through the K-nearest neighborhood graph based on an estimated metric for the vertices. Theoretical and practical results we've attained in estimating graphons, which are non-parametric exchangeable network models, are presented, and we benchmark these against current advanced graphon estimation techniques.
Tesla China's Model 3s have a 'Boat Mode' that allows them to navigate through deep floodwaters, which is particularly useful in flood-prone areas like China. Many videos of the Model 3's 'Boat Mode' in action have recently been shared, showing the vehicles successfully traveling through deep floodwaters.
We introduce techniques for serializing and deserializing tree ensembles in order to optimize inference speed when models are not already loaded into memory. This is particularly useful when models are too large to fit into memory, as well as in situations where models are deployed on low-resource devices like Internet of Things devices or run as Web micro-services with resources allocated on demand. Our packed serialized trees (PACSET) encode reference locality in the organization of a tree ensemble using principles from external memory algorithms. The organization interweaves related nodes across multiple trees, uses leaf cardinality to group the nodes on the most common paths, and is optimized for the IO blocksize. The result is that each IO operation produces a higher percentage of useful data, resulting in a 2-6 times reduction in classification latency for interactive workloads.

There is no straightforward analytical formula or rapid technique to determine probabilities solely based on a signal or process's entropy. One needs to determine the underlying probabilities through search methods, which become increasingly computationally costly as the entropy increases. This paper presents a method for calculating a joint probability matrix from the entropy for any order. With this technique, only the first-order entropies need to be calculated; the others can be derived through multiplicative cascades.
This study tackles the challenge of recognizing actions in trimmed videos in real-time, where deep neural networks currently lead in performance according to recent works. To enhance recognition accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, various limitations within the recognition process have been considered, including network architecture, the number of inputs (with additional inputs enriching the color data), and optimization of the loss function, among others. The standard approach in the field has been to train networks to classify all the action categories in a given dataset. However, we suggest training an array of specialized networks instead, with each one designed to identify a subset of action categories. Our approach involves a novel optimized system that relies on dissimilarity for assigning action categories across these specialized networks, which can be trained simultaneously in an offline setting. Using two benchmark datasets, UCF-101 and HMDB-51, our strategy showcases equal or better performance in some respects compared to current leading methods, while adhering to real-time processing requirements. On the notably difficult HMDB-51 dataset, we achieved 72.5% accuracy. By allocating fewer and distinct classes to each module network, our research demonstrates how to utilize more efficient architectures without losing out on accuracy. An initial version of this study has been previously published.
In anonymous broadcasting, one or more parties wish to send messages anonymously to all parties. This issue is becoming increasingly crucial as a black-box in various privacy-preserving applications, such as anonymous communication, distributed auctions, and multi-party computation. In this study, we create decentralized protocols for anonymous broadcast that require each party to transmit and process a polylogarithmic number of bits and operations per anonymous bit delivered with O (log n) rounds of communication. Our protocol is secure against traffic analysis, does not rely on any trusted party, and is completely load-balanced. The protocol can handle up to n 6 statically-scheduled Byzantine parties that are controlled by a computationally unbounded adversary. Our main strategy for achieving scalability is to perform local communications and computations among a logarithmic number of parties. We provide simulation results that demonstrate our protocol's significant improvement over previous work. Finally, we show that using a common cryptographic tool in our protocol can achieve practical results for anonymous broadcast.
Research interest in multispectral pedestrian detection has grown due to its critical importance in various applications, especially under low light conditions. A human baseline was established using the KAIST dataset, revealing a substantial gap between current top detectors and human performance. To narrow this gap, a network fusion architecture is proposed, which includes a multispectral proposal network and a subsequent multispectral classification network. This unified network is trained to optimize pedestrian detection and semantic segmentation tasks. The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the KAIST dataset while remaining efficient. In addition, sanitized training annotations for the KAIST dataset are provided, and the impact of different types of annotation errors is examined, offering potential for further research in the field.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has become the gold standard for non-invasively assessing cardiac function, allowing for precise quantification of functional parameters such as chamber volumes and ejection fraction. Deep learning models have demonstrated potential in automating the necessary cardiac structure segmentation, but their lack of robustness has limited their widespread clinical adoption. Since neural networks trained on data from a specific scanner may not generalize well to data acquired at a different center or with a different scanner due to differences in data characteristics, we propose a principled solution to address this domain shift problem. By utilizing domain-adversarial learning, we train a domain-invariant 2D U-Net with labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach is evaluated on both seen and unseen domains from the MMs challenge dataset, and the domain-adversarial approach shows improved performance compared to standard training. Moreover, we demonstrate that the domain information cannot be recovered from the learned features.

The primary goal of this research is to establish a framework for logical inference concerning distributed time-stamped allegations. This logic, beyond its theoretical intrigue as a standalone subject, is especially pertinent for practical scenarios where one must scrutinize a vast array of evidence from diverse sources, which may include conflicting information and varying degrees of source reliability. We present the Time-Stamped Claim Logic, complete with a robust and comprehensive sequent calculus that aids in condensing the evidence corpus and rectifying inconsistencies. Thus, the logic guarantees outcomes that align with the established trust hierarchies. To demonstrate the practical application of Time-Stamped Claim Logic, we analyze an actual cyber-attribution scenario. Keywords: Time-stamped claim logic, labelled deduction, Gentzen calculus, evidence logic, cybersecurity.

An innovative Israeli startup, Nanomedic Technologies, has developed a hand-held device capable of producing a temporary, see-through skin substitute that can be administered to wounds without making contact. This device leverages unique electrospinning technology that harnesses a high voltage electric field to transform polymer solutions into nanofibers, which aggregate into a mat resembling skin structure. Depending on individual patient requirements, the polymer mixture might include substances like antibacterial ointments, antibiotics, collagen, silicone, hydrogels, or cannabinoids. The process is rapid, enabling patients to shower just 48 hours later without needing to reapply dressings to the wound. The device is anticipated to hit the market in the latter part of 2019.
The classic problem of Fourier phase retrieval involves reconstructing an image from the amplitude measurements of its Fourier coefficients. Traditional approaches to this problem involve iterative minimization, utilizing prior knowledge of the image's structure. Ambiguities in the Fourier measurements, such as shifts and flips, make this problem challenging, and many existing methods employ multiple random restarts with different permutations. In this study, we introduce the idea of adding a known reference to the signal before capturing the Fourier amplitude measurements, inspired by holography. Our approach involves using an iterative phase retrieval method as an unrolled network and using back propagation to learn the reference for optimal signal reconstruction. Through simulations on various datasets under different conditions, we found that our proposed method achieves near-perfect recovery at a low computational cost. When compared to standard Fourier phase retrieval methods, our approach using the learned reference demonstrates significant performance improvement. Our code is available for access.
The issue of anonymous broadcast, where one or more parties want to send messages to all parties anonymously, is increasingly important in various privacy-preserving applications. This includes tasks such as anonymous communication, distributed auctions, and multi-party computation. In this article, we propose decentralized protocols for anonymous broadcast that only require each party to send (and compute) a polylogarithmic number of bits (and operations) for each anonymous bit delivered, with O(log n) rounds of communication. Our protocol is designed to be secure against traffic analysis, does not rely on any trusted party, and distributes the load evenly. It can tolerate up to n 6 statically-scheduled Byzantine parties controlled by a computationally unbounded adversary. Our main strategy for achieving scalability is to enable local communications (and computations) among a logarithmic number of parties. We also present simulation results demonstrating the significant improvement of our protocol over previous approaches. Lastly, we demonstrate that by utilizing a common cryptographic tool, our protocol can achieve practical results for anonymous broadcast.

LIDAR (light detection and ranging) is a technology that uses light to measure the distance and reflectivity between a sensor and an object. Historically, LIDAR-generated data has become the go-to for creating Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), which are essential in applications such as extracting roads, hydrological studies, flood mapping, and analyzing surfaces. Studies related to flooding highlight that using high-resolution DEMs can significantly enhance the precision and dependability of these applications. Yet, obtaining high-resolution DEMs remains a challenge across many regions within the US and globally, often due to the high cost and technological barriers associated with data collection. Fortunately, advancements in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and innovative algorithms have made deep learning an attractive option for researchers, especially for analyzing high-resolution data. Cutting-edge methods, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have been introduced to create smart models capable of correcting and enhancing large datasets. In this research, we propose a model using a GAN inspired by single image super-resolution techniques that is capable of quadrupling the spatial resolution of an existing DEM dataset, without needing any extra information.

The research community has become increasingly interested in multispectral pedestrian detection due to its importance for various around-the-clock applications (e.g., video surveillance and autonomous driving), particularly under low-light conditions. We create a human baseline over the KAIST dataset and demonstrate that there is still a significant gap between the current top detectors and human performance. To reduce this gap, we propose a network fusion architecture that consists of a multispectral proposal network for generating pedestrian proposals and a subsequent multispectral classification network for distinguishing pedestrian instances from hard negatives. The unified network is trained by jointly optimizing pedestrian detection and semantic segmentation tasks. The final detections are obtained by combining the outputs from different modalities and the two stages. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the KAIST dataset while maintaining speed. Additionally, we provide a sanitized version of the training annotations for the KAIST dataset and investigate the effects of different types of annotation errors. Future research on this problem will benefit from the sanitized version, which eliminates the interference of annotation errors.

In single image super-resolution based on machine learning, the degradation model is incorporated into the generation of training data. However, current methods for super-resolution of satellite images mostly use a basic down-sampling model with a fixed kernel to generate training images. While these methods work well with artificial data, they do not perform effectively with actual satellite images. Our solution involves creating a more realistic model for generating training data using commercial satellite imagery products, taking into account both the satellite imaging process and post-processing on the ground. We also propose a convolutional neural network specifically optimized for satellite images. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed training data generation model enhances the performance of super-resolution on real satellite images.

Microfluidic devices are used in a variety of applications, particularly in medical diagnostics, with inertial flow sculpting being a popular form. In this paper, the inverse problem of identifying a sequence of pillars for desired flow transformation is posed as a Reinforcement Learning problem, with a DoubleDQN model achieving a 90% success rate in 200,000 episodes. The results also demonstrate the potential for transferring learning from one target flow shape to another for a generic design of flow shape.
We explore a fresh strategy for covertly introducing backdoors into machine learning models by tampering with the loss calculation in the training code. The attacker is unable to change the training data, watch the code's execution, or access the finished model because our attack is blind. We create a novel method for covert backdoor training that uses multi-objective optimization to achieve high accuracy on both the primary and backdoor tasks while avoiding all known defenses. We then show the efficacy of the blind attack by introducing new, more potent backdoor classes than those in earlier literature, including single-pixel backdoors in ImageNet models, backdoors that change the model's task, and backdoors that don't require input changes during inference. Finally, we address potential defenses.

We introduce a new method for applying makeup to a face image using other images as style references. Our approach mimics physical makeup by adjusting color and skin details while preserving the structure of the face. First, we extract the foreground from both the subject and multiple example images, and then use image matting algorithms to extract semantic information such as faces, lips, teeth, eyes, eyebrows, etc. Once the semantic information is extracted, we transfer the makeup style between corresponding parts. The final step involves seamlessly blending different parts together using alpha blending and optimizing the color consistency of a collection of images. Our method has the advantage of not requiring face matching and can utilize multiple example images to fulfill user requirements. Additionally, it is not limited to head shot images and can handle makeup style changes in different scenarios without the need for the same pose or image size. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in faithfully transferring makeup.
Microfluidic devices control flow behavior in various applications, including medical diagnostics. Inertial microfluidic flow sculpting involves placing pillars to deform an initial flow field into a desired one, which can be defined as an inverse problem. This problem can be solved using Reinforcement Learning (RL) by training a DoubleDQN agent, resulting in successful learning with a 90% success rate in 200,000 episodes and converging rewards. The agent can also transfer learning from one target shape to another, making it useful for generic flow shape design.

Despite advancements in semantic segmentation, the field of medical ultra-resolution image segmentation still faces significant challenges. Approaches based on a multi-branch structure can strike a balance between computational workload and segmentation accuracy. However, the fusion structure in these methods must be carefully designed to achieve the desired results, leading to model redundancy. This paper introduces the Meta Segmentation Network (MSN) to address this challenging problem. By utilizing meta-learning, the fusion module of MSN is simple yet effective. MSN can quickly generate fusion layer weights through a simple meta-learner, requiring minimal training samples and epochs to converge. Additionally, to avoid training all branches from scratch, a specific weight-sharing mechanism is introduced to achieve rapid knowledge adaptation and share weights among multiple branches, resulting in improved performance and reduced parameters. Experimental results on the BACH and ISIC medical datasets demonstrate that MSN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
Bayesian optimization (BO) is an effective strategy for identifying the global maximum of costly black-box functions and has been notably successful in optimizing the hyper-parameters for machine learning algorithms. This process entails creating a predictive model of the function and optimizing a criterion to determine which data points to explore next. However, the complexity increases exponentially with the number of dimensions, making it impractical for BO to handle more than 10-20 variables. To overcome this limitation, our research presents a novel approach for high-dimensional BO that discovers a non-linear, lower-dimensional representation of the input space through a multi-layer neural network integrated within the Gaussian process's covariance function. This technique incorporates unsupervised learning for dimension reduction as part of the supervised regression, and leverages the data efficiency inherent in Gaussian process models within a Bayesian setting. Additionally, we developed a non-linear projection from the reduced manifold back to the original high-dimensional space using multi-output Gaussian processes, and we train this system in its entirety through marginal likelihood maximization. Our approach, which inherently operates on low-dimensional assumptions, demonstrates superior performance over recent standards in the field of high-dimensional BO, as evidenced by benchmark testing on functions with up to 60 dimensions.
OpenAI has made the complete version of its text-generating AI, GPT-2, publicly available. Initially, there were fears that it might be utilized to proliferate fraudulent news, spam, and disinformation. Following the initial announcement, OpenAI introduced smaller iterations of GPT-2, yet observed no substantial evidence of its misuse. GPT-2 is designed to produce cohesive text from simple cues, such as creating a full article from just a title. Its limitations are noticeable in maintaining consistency over longer texts, like keeping to one theme in a piece of news. The academic community continues to debate the ethical implications of releasing advanced AI technologies that could be exploited by nefarious users. OpenAI has developed methods that can identify text generated by GPT-2 with roughly 95 percent precision. Users can access a web-based version of GPT-2 via a provided link.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has become the standard method for non-invasive assessment of cardiac function, allowing for precise measurement of functional parameters such as chamber volumes and ejection fraction. Deep learning has the potential to automate the segmentation of cardiac structures, but the lack of robustness in deep learning models has limited their widespread use in clinical settings. Neural networks trained on data from one scanner may not perform well on data from a different scanner due to differences in data characteristics. In this study, we propose a solution to this problem using domain-adversarial learning to train a domain-invariant 2D U-Net using both labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach demonstrates improved performance compared to standard training when evaluated on data from both familiar and unfamiliar domains, and we also demonstrate that the domain information cannot be recovered from the learned features.

Studying and improving nanoscale devices can be challenging due to their small size and inability to reflect enough light for clear viewing. However, researchers at UC Riverside have developed a device that uses a tungsten lamp to produce color imaging at an unprecedented level by focusing light into a 6-nanometer spot at the end of a silver nanowire. This system can record changes in beam shape and color as the nanowire's tip moves over objects, and it can even create color photos of carbon nanotubes. This technology has the potential to significantly impact the development of more uniform nanomaterials and improve areas of research that have previously lacked such high resolution.
Nanomedic Technologies, a startup from Israel, has developed a portable device capable of producing a temporary and see-through layer of skin that can be applied to patients without touching the wound. The device utilizes an electric field to create nanofibers from polymer solutions, which then bond together in layers to form a skin-like mat. Depending on the patient's requirements, the polymer solution can be combined with antibacterial creams, antibiotics, collagen, silicon, hydrogel, or cannabinoids. Treatment is quick, and patients can shower only 2 days after application without having to change the wound dressing. The device is scheduled to be released in the latter part of 2019.
Researchers in Japan have created electronic chopsticks capable of amplifying the sensation of saltiness. These chopsticks employ a mild electric current to move sodium ions from the food, increasing the perceived saltiness by a factor of 1.5. The innovation has the potential to assist individuals in reducing their consumption of salt. Too much sodium in the diet is associated with risks like hypertension, strokes, and various other health conditions. These innovative chopsticks might become commercially available by the following year.
Process mining techniques aim to extract insights from event logs about how things are done. When applied to data from smart home environments, process mining has the potential to provide valuable insights into both healthy and unhealthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions. However, the events recorded in smart home environments are on the level of sensor triggers, which causes process discovery algorithms to produce overly general process models that allow for too much behavior and are difficult for human experts to interpret. We demonstrate that raising the level of event interpretation can enable the discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models. We present a framework for feature extraction that can be used for abstraction with supervised learning methods and is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. This framework can automatically abstract sensor-level events to their interpretation at the human activity level after being trained on training data that includes both the sensor and human activity events. Our abstraction framework is demonstrated on three real-life smart home event logs, and the results show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction are indeed more precise.
Vuity eye drops, which were just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, can help people with age-related blurred near vision see clearly without reading glasses for up to 10 hours by reducing pupil size. A 30-day supply of the drops costs around 80, but they are not covered by medical insurance. Headaches and red eyes are some of the potential side effects. It's important to note that the drops
In the last ten years, there has been extraordinary progress in the fields of artificial intelligence and photonic technologies, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with today's computing hardware. This study synthesizes cutting-edge advancements in both areas through the lens of reinforcement learning. We introduce a design for a photonic-based active learning machine that employs modern algorithms like SARSA, Q-learning, and projective simulation. Our numerical analysis of its effectiveness in common reinforcement learning scenarios indicates that it can tolerate or even benefit from a realistic degree of experimental noise. Notably, this architecture facilitates abstraction and generalization, two elements commonly deemed crucial to artificial intelligence. The suggested system, which utilizes single-photon travel through an adjustable mesh of beamsplitters, is straightforward, expandable, and its adoption in compact devices may soon be achievable with emerging technologies.
Massive MIMO is a crucial factor in low-latency communications, thanks to its high spatial degrees of freedom. The channel hardening and favorable propagation properties of Massive MIMO are particularly important for multiplexing several URLLC devices. However, the actual utility of channel hardening and spatial multiplexing is dependent critically on the accuracy of channel knowledge. When several low-latency devices are multiplexed, the cost for acquiring accurate knowledge becomes critical, and it is not evident how many devices can be served with a latency-reliability requirement and how many pilot symbols should be allocated. This paper investigates the trade-off between achieving high spectral efficiency and high reliability in the downlink, by employing various power allocation strategies, for maximum ratio and minimum mean square error precoders. The results show that using max-min SINR power allocation achieves the best reliability, at the expense of lower sum spectral efficiency.
1 1 footnote 1 The code is available at State-of-the-art pedestrian detection models have achieved great success in many benchmarks. However, these models require lots of annotation information and the labeling process usually takes much time and efforts. In this paper, we propose a method to generate labeled pedestrian data and adopt them to support the training of pedestrian detectors. Our proposed framework is built on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with multiple discriminators, trying to synthesize realistic pedestrians and learn the background context simultaneously. To handle the pedestrians of different sizes, we adopt the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer in the discriminator. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks. The results show that our framework can smoothly synthesize pedestrians on background images of variations and different levels of details. To quantitatively evaluate our approach, we add the generated samples into training data of the baseline pedestrian detectors and show the synthetic images are able to improve the detectors' performance.
One-fifth of all EV buyers switch back to gas vehicles because charging an electric vehicle is such a hassle. Researchers at Cornell University have created technology that can charge cars while they are in motion on the road. Highways can have lanes dedicated to charging, making it unnecessary to stop to charge or refuel. It's unclear whether or not this technology will ever be used on actual roads, but Toyota is collaborating with the research team to
Gmail has turned 15 and has added some new features to its repertoire. Users can now schedule emails to be sent at more convenient times, or delay sending them. Another new feature, Smart Compose, uses AI to recognize common greetings and predict the text of an email's body. Although Smart Compose has been gradually introduced since March, Google has only now confirmed its availability on all Android devices and in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. Support for iOS is imminent.The children felt listless. Their mother suggested they watch a movie. Retrieving a DVD from the cabinet, they found it too scratched to function. This left the children feeling irritated.
The concepts of singularities and regular points are expanded from linear ordinary differential equations to D-finite systems. For a D-finite system, regular points are defined by the formal power series solutions it yields. It is also demonstrated that apparent singularities can be eliminated in a manner analogous to the univariate scenario by incorporating proper extra solutions into the current system. We discuss a number of algorithms for identifying and eliminating apparent singularities. Furthermore, an algorithm is provided to compute the formal power series solutions for a D-finite system at points where singularities appear to be present.

LinkedIn has announced the expansion of its Service Marketplace, a platform that allows freelancers to promote their services to those seeking short-term hires. The service initially launched as a trial in February and has since attracted 2 million users. It is now accessible worldwide and offers 250 job categories, with intentions to increase to 500. Currently, Service Marketplace does not impose any fees, although there are plans to introduce fees in the future. The platform is still under development and many features are yet to be rolled out.
All 30 Fry's Electronics stores across the United States will close down. On Tuesday, employees of the large retail chain revealed that they were unexpectedly let go that day. Some workers were assigned to send back any remaining products to the suppliers on their last day. While Fry's website has started to display error messages, some of its subdomains are still operational. The company has deactivated its Facebook page and restricted access to its Twitter profile. An official statement is anticipated to be released in the near future.
