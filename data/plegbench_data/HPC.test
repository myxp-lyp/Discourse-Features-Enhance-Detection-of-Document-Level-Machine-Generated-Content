Keypoint-based methods are a relatively new paradigm in object detection, eliminating the need for anchor boxes and offering a simplified detection framework. Keypoint-based CornerNet achieves state of the art accuracy among single-stage detectors. However, this accuracy comes at high processing cost. In this work, we tackle the problem of efficient keypoint-based object detection and introduce CornerNet-Lite. CornerNet-Lite is a combination of two efficient variants of CornerNet: CornerNet-Saccade, which uses an attention mechanism to eliminate the need for exhaustively processing all pixels of the image, and CornerNet-Squeeze, which introduces a new compact backbone architecture. Together these two variants address the two critical use cases in efficient object detection: improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, and improving accuracy at real-time efficiency. CornerNet-Saccade is suitable for offline processing, improving the efficiency of CornerNet by 6.0x and the AP by 1.0 on COCO. CornerNet-Squeeze is suitable for real-time detection, improving both the efficiency and accuracy of the popular real-time detector YOLOv3 (34.4 AP at 34ms for CornerNet-Squeeze compared to 33.0 AP at 39ms for YOLOv3 on COCO). Together these contributions for the first time reveal the potential of keypoint-based detection to be useful for applications requiring processing efficiency.
Architecture patterns capture architectural design experience and provide abstract solutions to recurring architectural design problems. They consist of a description of component types and restrict component connection and activation. Therefore, they guarantee some desired properties for architectures employing the pattern. Unfortunately, most documented patterns do not provide a formal guarantee of whether their specification indeed leads to the desired guarantee. Failure in doing so, however, might lead to wrong architectures, i.e., architectures wrongly supposed to show certain desired properties. Since architectures, in general, have a high impact on the quality of the resulting system and architectural flaws are only difficult, if not to say impossible, to repair, this may lead to badly reparable quality issues in the resulting system. To address this problem, we propose an approach based on model checking to verify pattern specifications w.r.t. their guarantees. In the following we apply the approach to three well-known patterns for dynamic architectures: the Singleton, the Model-View-Controller, and the Broker pattern. Thereby, we discovered ambiguities and missing constraints for all three specifications. Thus, we conclude that verifying patterns of dynamic architectures using model checking is feasible and useful to discover ambiguities and flaws in pattern specifications.

We analyze the performance of TCP and TCP with network coding (TCPNC) in lossy networks. We build upon the framework introduced by Padhye et al. and characterize the throughput behavior of classical TCP and TCPNC as a function of erasure probability, round-trip time, maximum window size, and duration of the connection. Our analytical results show that network coding masks random erasures from TCP, thus preventing TCP's performance degradation in lossy networks. It is further seen that TCPNC has significant throughput gains over TCP. In addition, we show that TCPNC may lead to cost reduction for wireless network providers while maintaining a certain quality of service to their users. We measure the cost in terms of number of base stations, which is highly correlated to the energy, capital, and operational costs of a network provider. We show that increasing the available bandwidth may not necessarily lead to increase in throughput, particularly in lossy networks in which TCP does not perform well. We show that using protocols such as TCPNC, which are more resilient to erasures, may lead to a throughput commensurate the bandwidth dedicated to each user.
The scientific method drives improvements in public health, but a strategy of obstructionism has impeded scientists from gathering even a minimal amount of information to address America's gun violence epidemic. We argue that in spite of a lack of federal investment, large amounts of publicly available data offer scientists an opportunity to measure a range of firearm-related behaviors. Given the diversity of available data - including news coverage, social media, web forums, online advertisements, and Internet searches (to name a few) - there are ample opportunities for scientists to study everything from trends in particular types of gun violence to gun-related behaviors (such as purchases and safety practices) to public understanding of and sentiment towards various gun violence reduction measures. Science has been sidelined in the gun violence debate for too long. Scientists must tap the big media datastream and help resolve this crisis.

Former Facebook software engineer Patrick Shyu runs a YouTube channel called TechLead which has over 500,000 subscribers. He has posted six videos making fun of Facebook since he was dismissed on August 26. In these videos, he criticizes the work culture, calling it a popularity contest where ideas and projects are driven by likes and comments rather than logic. Shyu had been working at Facebook since May 2018 and had previously worked at Google for four years. He currently makes well over 500,000 through his YouTube videos.
The new Hololens 2 from Microsoft comes with a load of new technology, which is not surprising since the last version was announced 4 years ago. The new design fixes many of the problems with the previous version. It has a wider field of view, higher definition, retina scanning for authentication, better hand gesture recognition, and many more features. The headset is designed for workers and not consumers, and will only be available for enterprise customers. A 7 minute video is available with plenty of footage showing the device in action.
Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) systems track targets across cameras. Due to the continuity of target trajectories, tracking systems usually restrict their data association within a local neighborhood. In single camera tracking, local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames; in multi-camera tracking, it refers to neighboring cameras that the target may appear successively. For similarity estimation, tracking systems often adopt appearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) perspective. Different from tracking, re-ID usually does not have access to the trajectory cues that can limit the search space to a local neighborhood. Due to its global matching property, the re-ID perspective requires to learn global appearance features. We argue that the mismatch between the local matching procedure in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may compromise MTMCT performance. To fit the local matching procedure in MTMCT, in this work, we introduce locality aware appearance metric (LAAM). Specifically, we design an intra-camera metric for single camera tracking, and an inter-camera metric for multi-camera tracking. Both metrics are trained with data pairs sampled from their corresponding local neighborhoods, as opposed to global sampling in the re-ID perspective. We show that the locally learned metrics can be successfully applied on top of several globally learned re-ID features. With the proposed method, we report new state-of-the-art performance on the DukeMTMC dataset, and a substantial improvement on the CityFlow dataset.

The theory of isospectral flows comprises a large class of continuous dynamical systems, particularly integrable systems and Lie-Poisson systems. Their discretization is a classical problem in numerical analysis. Preserving the spectra in the discrete flow requires the conservation of high order polynomials, which is hard to come by. Existing methods achieving this are complicated and usually fail to preserve the underlying Lie-Poisson structure. Here we present a class of numerical methods of arbitrary order for Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian isospectral flows, which preserve both the spectra and the Lie-Poisson structure. The methods are surprisingly simple, and avoid the use of constraints or exponential maps. Furthermore, due to preservation of the Lie-Poisson structure, they exhibit near conservation of the Hamiltonian function. As an illustration, we apply the methods to several classical isospectral flows. Keywords: isospectral flow, Lie-Poisson integrator, symplectic Runge-Kutta methods, Toda flow, generalized rigid body, Chu's flow, Bloch-Iserles flow, Euler equations, point-vortices MSC 2010: 37M15, 65P10, 37J15, 53D20, 70H06

Caesar was playing at home with his new remote controlled helicopter. He was determined to make it do a 360 degree spin. For that reason he flew it as fast as he could around every room. He reached the living room and flew too close to the chandelier. The copter crashed and went flying into several successful 360 spins.
Despite recent progress on semantic segmentation, there still exist huge challenges in medical ultra-resolution image segmentation. The methods based on multi-branch structure can make a good balance between computational burdens and segmentation accuracy. However, the fusion structure in these methods require to be designed elaborately to achieve desirable result, which leads to model redundancy. In this paper, we propose Meta Segmentation Network (MSN) to solve this challenging problem. With the help of meta-learning, the fusion module of MSN is quite simple but effective. MSN can fast generate the weights of fusion layers through a simple meta-learner, requiring only a few training samples and epochs to converge. In addition, to avoid learning all branches from scratch, we further introduce a particular weight sharing mechanism to realize a fast knowledge adaptation and share the weights among multiple branches, resulting in the performance improvement and significant parameters reduction. The experimental results on two challenging ultra-resolution medical datasets BACH and ISIC show that MSN achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

This paper presents the impact of using quantization on the efficiency of multi-class text classification in the training process of a support vector machine (SVM). This work is focused on comparing the efficiency of SVM model trained using reduced precision with its original form. The main advantage of using quantization is decrease in computation time and in memory footprint on the dedicated hardware platform which supports low precision computation like GPU (16-bit) or FPGA (any bit-width). The paper presents the impact of a precision reduction of the SVM training process on text classification accuracy. The implementation of the CPU was performed using the OpenMP library. Additionally, the results of the implementation of the GPU using double, single and half precision are presented.

The Count-Min sketch is an important and well-studied data summarization method. It allows one to estimate the count of any item in a stream using a small, fixed size data sketch. However, the accuracy of the sketch depends on characteristics of the underlying data. This has led to a number of count estimation procedures which work well in one scenario but perform poorly in others. A practitioner is faced with two basic, unanswered questions. Which variant should be chosen when the data is unknown? Given an estimate, is its error sufficiently small to be trustworthy? We provide answers to these questions. We derive new count estimators, including a provably optimal estimator, which best or match previous estimators in all scenarios. We also provide practical, tight error bounds at query time for both new and existing estimators. These error estimates also yield procedures to choose the sketch tuning parameters optimally, as they can extrapolate the error to different choices of sketch width and depth. The key observation is that the distribution of errors in each counter can be empirically estimated from the sketch itself. By first estimating this distribution, count estimation becomes a statistical estimation and inference problem with a known error distribution. This provides both a principled way to derive new and optimal estimators as well as a way to study the error and properties of existing estimators.
Some remote locations can't be reached by road, so ten years ago, conservationists started occasionally using helicopters to move rhinos between territories. The rhinos are transported upside down because it is faster, easier, and less expensive than using stretchers. It is also the better option for their health. The position allows the spine to stretch, opening up the airways, and the faster process means the animals are sedated for less time. Pictures of rhinos being airlifted are available.

Apple has been granted a patent for software that generates synthetic group selfies. The software is likely a method for taking group selfies for social media even during social distancing. Users would be able to invite others to take part in a group selfie and the software would then arrange the images together into a single picture. The resulting picture will be customizable, so users should be able to modify the position of the people in the photo or store the original images separately. Apple first filed for the patent in 2018 and it was just granted at the beginning of June.
