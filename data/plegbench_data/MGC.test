Keypoint-based methods represent a fresh approach to object detection, dispensing with anchor boxes and streamlining the detection process. CornerNet, which relies on keypoints, achieves top-notch accuracy among single-stage detectors. However, this accuracy comes at a high computational cost. In this study, we aim to improve the efficiency of keypoint-based object detection and introduce CornerNet-Lite. CornerNet-Lite combines two efficient versions of CornerNet: CornerNet-Saccade, which employs an attention mechanism to avoid processing every pixel in the image, and CornerNet-Squeeze, which features a new compact backbone architecture. These two variants address two crucial scenarios in efficient object detection: maintaining accuracy while enhancing efficiency, and improving accuracy at real-time efficiency. CornerNet-Saccade is suitable for offline processing and boosts CornerNet's efficiency by 6.0x while improving AP by 1.0 on COCO. CornerNet-Squeeze is designed for real-time detection, surpassing YOLOv3 (34.4
Architectural design experience is captured by architecture patterns, which offer general solutions to frequently encountered architectural design issues. They specify the types of components and constrain how they can be connected and activated, ensuring that the resulting architectures have certain desirable characteristics. Unfortunately, most documented patterns do not offer a formal guarantee that their specifications will result in the promised guarantees. This could result in inappropriate architectures芒鈧鈥漣.e., architectures mistakenly believed to exhibit certain desirable traits. Since architectures have a significant impact on a system's quality and fixing architectural flaws is challenging, if not impossible, this could result in severe and irreparable quality issues in the final product. To address this issue, we suggest a model-checking-based technique to confirm that pattern specifications match their guarantees. We use the technique on three well-known dynamic architecture patterns芒鈧鈥漷he Singleton, the Model-View-Controller, and the Broker pattern芒鈧鈥漚nd discover ambiguities and missing constraints in all three specifications. As a result, we conclude that using model checking to validate dynamic architecture patterns is both practical and beneficial for discovering flaws and ambiguities in pattern specific

Our study investigates the efficacy of TCP as well as TCP with network coding (TCPNC) within networks experiencing data loss. We build on the foundational work by Padhye et al. to describe how the throughput of traditional TCP and TCPNC correlates with factors such as loss likelihood, round-trip timing, the maximum size of the data window, and the length of the connection. The analytical findings indicate that network coding conceals random data loss from TCP, thereby safeguarding the protocol from performance drops in unreliable networks. Moreover, TCPNC demonstrates a considerable advantage in throughput compared to standard TCP. Additionally, our results suggest that TCPNC could lead to savings for wireless network providers, while still delivering a reliable level of service to customers. We assess cost through the number of base stations, which closely relates to the energy, capital, and operational expenses of network providers. We demonstrate that merely increasing bandwidth does not guarantee a boost in throughput, especially in lossy networks where TCP struggles. Instead, the deployment of protocols like TCPNC, which are better at handling data loss, can achieve throughput that is proportional to the bandwidth allocated to each user.
The pursuit of scientific inquiry advances public health, yet active efforts to block research have hindered scientists from collecting even the basic data necessary to tackle the gun violence crisis in the United States. Despite the absence of federal funding, there is an abundance of accessible public data that can enable scientists to analyze various firearm-related activities. The diversity of data sources available 芒鈧鈥 such as journalistic reports, social networks, online forums, digital advertising, and web searches, among others 芒鈧鈥 presents numerous chances for scientists to explore aspects ranging from gun violence tendencies to firearm-related actions (like buying habits and safety measures) to the public's perception and attitude towards initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence. The role of science has been marginalized in the conversation on gun violence for far too long. It is imperative for scientists to leverage the vast amount of data available through various media channels to help address this urgent issue.

MTMCT systems are used to track targets across multiple cameras, and they typically limit their data association to a local neighborhood in order to ensure the continuity of target trajectories. In single camera tracking, the local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames, while in multi-camera tracking, it refers to neighboring cameras where the target may appear in succession. These tracking systems often use appearance features learned from a re-identification (re-ID) perspective for similarity estimation. Unlike tracking, re-ID does not have access to trajectory cues and requires learning global appearance features for matching. The discrepancy between the local matching process in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may impact the performance of MTMCT. To address this, we propose the use of a locality aware appearance metric (LAAM) to fit the local matching process in MTMCT. This includes designing an intra-camera metric for single camera tracking and an inter-camera metric for multi-camera tracking, both trained with data pairs sampled from their corresponding local neighborhoods. We demonstrate that these locally learned metrics can effectively complement globally learned re-ID features. With this approach, we have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the DukeMTMC dataset and a significant improvement on the CityFlow dataset.

The concept of isospectral flows encompasses a broad spectrum of continuous dynamic systems, including those that are integrable and those with Lie-Poisson structures. Numerical analysis traditionally grapples with their discretization. To maintain the spectra in the discrete counterpart, one must ensure the persistence of advanced order polynomials, which is seldom achieved. Common methods that intend to do this are often complex and do not successfully retain the inherent Lie-Poisson framework. In this paper, we introduce a new classification of numerical methods of any desired order for both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian isospectral flows. Remarkably, these methods are uncomplicated, maintain the spectra and Lie-Poisson structure, and do not rely on constraints or exponential mapping. Additionally, the preservation of Lie-Poisson structure enables them to nearly conserve the Hamiltonian function. We demonstrate the application of these methods on a variety of well-known isospectral flows to highlight their effectiveness. Keywords: isospectral flow, Lie-Poisson integrator, symplectic Runge-Kutta methods, Toda flow, generalized rigid body, Chu's flow, Bloch-Iserles flow, Euler equations, point-vortices MSC 2010: 37M15, 65P10, 37J15, 53D20, 70H06

While recent advancements have been made in semantic segmentation, substantial difficulties remain in segmenting medical images of ultra-high resolution. Strategies using a multi-branch infrastructure strike an effective balance between computational demands and precision in segmentation. Yet these techniques necessitate careful design in their fusion processes to reach optimal outcomes, often leading to an excess in model complexity. In our study, we introduce the Meta Segmentation Network (MSN) to address this difficult issue. Leveraging meta-learning, MSN's fusion component is straightforward yet impactful. The network quickly derives the weights for the fusion layers using a basic meta-learner, which achieves convergence with minimal training examples and epochs. To prevent the necessity of developing each branch from the ground up, we also incorporate a unique weight-sharing strategy. This approach enables rapid knowledge transfer and weight distribution across multiple branches, enhancing overall performance and significantly reducing the number of parameters. Our testing on two complex ultra-resolution medical datasets, BACH and ISIC, demonstrates that MSN outperforms leading-edge methods.

The manuscript details the effects of applying quantization on how efficiently multi-class text classification is conducted during a support vector machine's (SVM) training phase. It compares the effectiveness of an SVM model trained with reduced precision to one in its standard form. The primary benefit of quantization is a reduction in both the computation time and the memory usage on a hardware platform designed for low-precision operations, such as 16-bit GPUs or FPGAs of any bit-width. The document outlines how reducing precision in the SVM's training impacts the accuracy of text classification. The CPU-based implementation was done via the OpenMP library, and it also showcases the GPU implementation results at double, single, and half-precision levels.

The Count-Min sketch is a well-researched method for summarizing data. It allows for estimating the count of any item in a stream using a small, fixed-size data sketch. However, the accuracy of the sketch depends on the characteristics of the underlying data, leading to different count estimation procedures that perform well in some scenarios but poorly in others. This presents practitioners with two fundamental, unanswered questions: which variant should be chosen when the data is unknown, and is the error of a given estimate sufficiently small to be reliable? Our research addresses these questions by introducing new count estimators, including an optimal estimator that either outperforms or matches previous estimators in all scenarios. We also provide tight error bounds at query time for both new and existing estimators. These error estimates also help in choosing the optimal tuning parameters for the sketch, as they can predict the error for different choices of sketch width and depth. The key insight is that the error distribution in each counter can be empirically estimated from the sketch itself. By estimating this distribution, count estimation becomes a statistical estimation and inference problem with a known error distribution, providing a principled way to derive new and optimal estimators as well as to study the error and properties of existing estimators.
A decade ago, conservationists began using helicopters to relocate rhinos between remote areas inaccessible by road. The rhinos are transported upside down as it is a quicker, more convenient, and cost-effective method than using stretchers. Additionally, it is better for the rhinos' well-being, as being transported in this position allows for their spines to stretch, opening up their airways, and the sedation process is shorter. There are images of rhinos being airlifted available for viewing.
