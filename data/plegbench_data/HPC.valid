Nicole was a nursing aide at a nearby nursing home and a student. She worked full time at the home, but still managed do well in school. Halfway through the semester, her car broke down on the way to school. It became clear she wouldn't have another way to get around. Eventually Nicole had to take a few weeks off of both and loved it.
Uber, in partnership with Thames Clippers, will soon offer boat journeys in London. Passengers will receive a QR code boarding pass once they book their trip through the Uber app. The boats will continue to operate on their current set routes, and customers will be able to use existing payment methods to pay for their journeys. The city of London has explored other transport options due to the pandemic. It has invested in its cycling infrastructure and fast-tracked its e-scooter rental trials.
Outcomes with a natural order commonly occur in prediction tasks and oftentimes the available input data are a mixture of complex data, like images, and tabular predictors. Although deep Learning (DL) methods have shown outstanding performance on image classification, most models treat ordered outcomes as unordered and lack interpretability. In contrast, classical ordinal regression models yield interpretable predictor effects but are limited to tabular input data. Here, we present the highly modular class of ordinal neural network transformation models (ontram s). Transformation models use a parametric transformation function and a simple distribution to trade off flexibility and interpretability of individual model components. In ontram s, this trade-off is achieved by additively decomposing the transformation function into terms for the tabular and image data using a set of jointly trained neural networks. We show that the most flexible ontram s achieve on-par performance with DL classifiers while outperforming them in training speed. We discuss how to interpret components of ontram s in general and in the case of correlated tabular and image data. Taken together, ontram s join benefits of DL and distributional regression to create interpretable prediction models for ordinal outcomes.

: We propose a framework for studying the stability of discrete-event systems modelled as switching max-plus linear systems. In this framework, we propose a set of notions of stability for generic discrete-event systems in the max-plus algebra. Then we show the loss of equivalence of these notions for switching max-plus linear systems due to the lack of global monotonicity and the accompanying difficulty in rigorous analysis. This serves as a motivation to relax the assumption on monotonicity of the dynamics to positive invariance of max-plus cones. Then we proceed to generalise the notions of stability when the dynamics is restricted to such cones. The stability analysis approach presented in this paper serves as a first step to study the stability of a general class of switching max-plus linear systems.
The home football team was down a touchdown. There was only a few seconds left on the clock. The team was buried deep in their own backfield. The coach called a last minute play. The hail mary pass was caught, and the home team won.
Recently, deep learning has been proposed as a potential technique for improving the physical layer performance of radio receivers. Despite the large amount of encouraging results, most works have not considered spatial multiplexing in the context of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) receivers. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based MIMO receiver architecture that consists of a ResNet-based convolutional neural network, also known as DeepRx, combined with a so-called transformation layer, all trained together. We propose two novel alternatives for the transformation layer: a maximal ratio combining-based transformation, or a fully learned transformation. The former relies more on expert knowledge, while the latter utilizes learned multiplicative layers. Both proposed transformation layers are shown to clearly outperform the conventional baseline receiver, especially with sparse pilot configurations. To the best of our knowledge, these are some of the first results showing such high performance for a fully learned MIMO receiver.
Scientists from Zhejiang University in China have tested swarms of drones that can autonomously navigate through complex environments. The drones can fly through dense bamboo forests while avoiding other drones. There are many applications for autonomous drone swarms, such as mapping areas that humans can't reach during disasters or lifting and delivering heavy objects. There are also military applications. The technology will likely be deployed in real-life work within a few years. A video of the drones flying through a bamboo forest is available.
It is now a common practice to compare models of human language processing by predicting participant reactions (such as reading times) to corpora consisting of rich naturalistic linguistic materials. However, many of the corpora used in these studies are based on naturalistic text and thus do not contain many of the low-frequency syntactic constructions that are often required to distinguish processing theories. Here we describe a new corpus consisting of English texts edited to contain many low-frequency syntactic constructions while still sounding fluent to native speakers. The corpus is annotated with hand-corrected parse trees and includes self-paced reading time data. Here we give an overview of the content of the corpus and release the data. 1 footnote 1 1 footnote 1 Available from .

LinkedIn is opening up its Service Marketplace, a service that lets freelancers advertise to those looking to hire people for short-term engagements. Service Marketplace began as a test in February and has picked up 2 million users since. The service is now available globally, featuring 250 job categories, with a plan to expand to 500. Service Marketplace currently does not charge any fees, but there are plans to introduce fees down the line. The service is still in development and many features are yet to be implemented.
Bars is a new iOS app from Facebook's New Product Experimentation group. It lets users post and share videos of them rapping over beats provided by the app. There are different levels in the app, with an auto-rhyme dictionary for beginners, and a Freestyle mode for more advanced rappers. The app is still in a closed beta. It is unlikely to make an appearance on the Android Play Store.
Massive MIMO is seen as a main enabler for low-latency communications, thanks to its high spatial degrees of freedom. The channel hardening and favorable propagation properties of Massive MIMO are particularly important for multiplexing several URLLC devices. However, the actual utility of channel hardening and spatial multiplexing is dependent critically on the accuracy of channel knowledge. When several low-latency devices are multiplexed, the cost for acquiring accurate knowledge becomes critical, and it is not evident how many devices can be served with a latency-reliability requirement and how many pilot symbols should be allocated. This paper investigates the trade-off between achieving high spectral efficiency and high reliability in the downlink, by employing various power allocation strategies, for maximum ratio and minimum mean square error precoders. The results show that using max-min SINR power allocation achieves the best reliability, at the expense of lower sum spectral efficiency.
There is no closed form analytical equation or quick method to calculate probabilities based only on the entropy of a signal or process. Except in the cases where there are constraints on the state probabilities, one must typically derive the underlying probabilities through search algorithms. These become more computationally expensive as entropies of higher orders are investigated. In this paper, a method to calculate a joint probability matrix based on the entropy for any order is elaborated. With this method, only first order entropies need to be successfully calculated while the others are derived via multiplicative cascades.

We present methods to serialize and deserialize tree ensembles that optimize inference latency when models are not already loaded into memory. This arises whenever models are larger than memory, but also systematically when models are deployed on low-resource devices, such as in the Internet of Things, or run as Web micro-services where resources are allocated on demand. Our packed serialized trees (PACSET) encode reference locality in the layout of a tree ensemble using principles from external memory algorithms. The layout interleaves correlated nodes across multiple trees, uses leaf cardinality to collocate the nodes on the most popular paths and is optimized for the IO blocksize. The result is that each IO yields a higher fraction of useful data, leading to a 2-6 times reduction in classification latency for interactive workloads.
Lionel Messi's financial package at Paris Saint Germain includes PSG Fan Tokens. The two-year deal, with an option for a third, includes an annual salary of 41 million plus bonuses, and a 30 million signing-on fee. It is expected to bring a windfall of commercial revenues, such as through jersey sales. Messi joined PSG as a free agent after Barcelona acknowledged that they could no longer afford him. The PSG token was designed to help PSG build a new fan community.
We generalize the notions of singularities and ordinary points from linear ordinary differential equations to D-finite systems. Ordinary points of a D-finite system are characterized in terms of its formal power series solutions. We also show that apparent singularities can be removed like in the univariate case by adding suitable additional solutions to the system at hand. Several algorithms are presented for removing and detecting apparent singularities. In addition, an algorithm is given for computing formal power series solutions of a D-finite system at apparent singularities.

Lenny heard chirping as he walked by the holly tree in his yard. He looked down and saw a baby bird on the ground. He carefully lifted it up and placed it in the nest with two others. He was worried the mother bird would reject this baby. But shortly after she came back with worms and fed all three of them.
Researchers have confirmed that recordings of musk ducks producing vocalizations made in 1987 and 2000 were indeed a form of mimicry. The recordings were the first example of musk ducks being able to mimic sounds. Vocal-production learning is when animals make vocalizations that deviate sharply from what is typical of the species or imitate the sounds of other species. The phenomenon has been observed in a handful of other species. Musk ducks may be able to demonstrate advanced vocal learning at a level comparable to songbirds and parrots, likely representing a case of independent evolution.
A flying car unveiled by NEC at a facility in the city of Abiko was able to hover steadily for about a minute using its four propellors during two brief demonstrations. Japan aims to be using flying cars by 2030 to connect islands in the Mie resort area. Dubai is also aggressively pursuing the technology. Flying cars are defined as aircraft which are electric, or hybrid electric, with driverless capabilities and the ability to take off and land vertically. They are also known as EVtol, electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. Compared to helicopters, they are less expensive to maintain, produce less noise, and don't require trained pilots. Uber is also launching a similar technology called Uber Air, starting demonstrator flights in 2020 and commercial operations in 2023.
The kids were bored. Their mom said they should pop in a movie. They pulled a DVD out of the cabinet. It was too scratched to play. The kids were frustrated.
