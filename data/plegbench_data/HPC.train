Every year the Sarver's celebrated Christmas at their winter lodge. This year they couldn't because of a fire. The fire burned the house down. They made a new tradition to celebrate at home. Everyone was still happy.
A piece of space debris too small to be tracked has hit the Canadarm2 robotic arm on the International Space Station. The arm is still operational but a small section of the arm boom and thermal blanket has been damaged. Canadarm2 has been on the station for 20 years, assisting with maneuvering objects outside the ISS. The damage was noticed during a routine inspection. It is unknown when the damage occurred. The event is still being analyzed to understand how it occurred and to assess future risk.

Current object detection frameworks mainly rely on bounding box regression to localize objects. Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, the precision of bounding box regression remains unsatisfactory, hence limiting performance in object detection. We observe that precise localization requires careful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream approach, which focuses on predicting centers and sizes, is not the most effective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists displacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively localized with a dedicated network branch. Moreover, to tackle the difficulty of precise localization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further propose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of movement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position within the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. Replacing the standard bounding box regression branch with the proposed design leads to significant improvements on Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, by 3.0, 1.6, and 0.9, respectively. Code and models will be available at .
We study an extention of total variation denoising over images to over Cartesian power graphs and its applications to estimating non-parametric network models. The power graph fused lasso (PGFL) segments a matrix by exploiting a known graphical structure, G , over the rows and columns. Our main results shows that for any connected graph, under subGaussian noise, the PGFL achieves the same mean-square error rate as 2D total variation denoising for signals of bounded variation. We study the use of the PGFL for denoising an observed network H , where we learn the graph G as the K -nearest neighborhood graph of an estimated metric over the vertices. We provide theoretical and empirical results for estimating graphons, a non-parametric exchangeable network model, and compare to the state of the art graphon estimation methods.
Tesla China's Model 3s are able to wade through water. China experiences dozens of hurricanes or typhoons every year, so floods are common. Many videos of the Model 3's 'Boat Mode' have come out in the last few days. The footage shows the vehicles traveling through deep floodwaters with no issues. Videos are available in the article.
We present methods to serialize and deserialize tree ensembles that optimize inference latency when models are not already loaded into memory. This arises whenever models are larger than memory, but also systematically when models are deployed on low-resource devices, such as in the Internet of Things, or run as Web micro-services where resources are allocated on demand. Our packed serialized trees (PACSET) encode reference locality in the layout of a tree ensemble using principles from external memory algorithms. The layout interleaves correlated nodes across multiple trees, uses leaf cardinality to collocate the nodes on the most popular paths and is optimized for the IO blocksize. The result is that each IO yields a higher fraction of useful data, leading to a 2-6 times reduction in classification latency for interactive workloads.

There is no closed form analytical equation or quick method to calculate probabilities based only on the entropy of a signal or process. Except in the cases where there are constraints on the state probabilities, one must typically derive the underlying probabilities through search algorithms. These become more computationally expensive as entropies of higher orders are investigated. In this paper, a method to calculate a joint probability matrix based on the entropy for any order is elaborated. With this method, only first order entropies need to be successfully calculated while the others are derived via multiplicative cascades.
This paper addresses the problem of real-time action recognition in trimmed videos, for which deep neural networks have defined the state-of-the-art performance in the recent literature. For attaining higher recognition accuracies with efficient computations, researchers have addressed the various aspects of limitations in the recognition pipeline. This includes network architecture, the number of input streams (where additional streams augment the color information), the cost function to be optimized, in addition to others. The literature has always aimed, though, at assigning the adopted network (or networks, in case of multiple streams) the task of recognizing the whole number of action classes in the dataset at hand. We propose to train multiple specialized module networks instead. Each module is trained to recognize a subset of the action classes. Towards this goal, we present a dissimilarity-based optimized procedure for distributing the action classes over the modules, which can be trained simultaneously offline. On two standard datasets-UCF-101 and HMDB-51-the proposed method demonstrates a comparable performance, that is superior in some aspects, to the state-of-the-art, and that satisfies the real-time constraint. We achieved 72.5 accuracy on the challenging HMDB-51 dataset. By assigning fewer and unalike classes to each module network, this research paves the way to benefit from light-weight architectures without compromising recognition accuracy 1 footnote 1 1 footnote 1 An earlier version of this research has appeared in .
In anonymous broadcast, one or more parties want to anonymously send messages to all parties. This problem is increasingly important as a black-box in many privacy-preserving applications such as anonymous communication, distributed auctions, and multi-party computation. In this paper, we design decentralized protocols for anonymous broadcast that require each party to send (and compute) a polylogarithmic number of bits (and operations) per anonymous bit delivered with O (log n) rounds of communication. Our protocol is provably secure against traffic analysis, does not require any trusted party, and is completely load-balanced. The protocol tolerates up to n 6 statically-scheduled Byzantine parties that are controlled by a computationally unbounded adversary. Our main strategy for achieving scalability is to perform local communications (and computations) among a logarithmic number of parties. We provide simulation results to show that our protocol improves significantly over previous work. We finally show that using a common cryptographic tool in our protocol one can achieve practical results for anonymous broadcast.
Multispectral pedestrian detection has attracted increasing attention from the research community due to its crucial competence for many around-the-clock applications (e.g., video surveillance and autonomous driving), especially under insufficient illumination conditions. We create a human baseline over the KAIST dataset and reveal that there is still a large gap between current top detectors and human performance. To narrow this gap, we propose a network fusion architecture, which consists of a multispectral proposal network to generate pedestrian proposals, and a subsequent multispectral classification network to distinguish pedestrian instances from hard negatives. The unified network is learned by jointly optimizing pedestrian detection and semantic segmentation tasks. The final detections are obtained by integrating the outputs from different modalities as well as the two stages. The approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the KAIST dataset while remain fast. Additionally, we contribute a sanitized version of training annotations for the KAIST dataset, and examine the effects caused by different kinds of annotation errors. Future research of this problem will benefit from the sanitized version which eliminates the interference of annotation errors.

Recently, deep learning has been proposed as a potential technique for improving the physical layer performance of radio receivers. Despite the large amount of encouraging results, most works have not considered spatial multiplexing in the context of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) receivers. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based MIMO receiver architecture that consists of a ResNet-based convolutional neural network, also known as DeepRx, combined with a so-called transformation layer, all trained together. We propose two novel alternatives for the transformation layer: a maximal ratio combining-based transformation, or a fully learned transformation. The former relies more on expert knowledge, while the latter utilizes learned multiplicative layers. Both proposed transformation layers are shown to clearly outperform the conventional baseline receiver, especially with sparse pilot configurations. To the best of our knowledge, these are some of the first results showing such high performance for a fully learned MIMO receiver.
Cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has become the gold standard for the non-invasive evaluation of cardiac function. In particular, it allows the accurate quantification of functional parameters including the chamber volumes and ejection fraction. Deep learning has shown the potential to automate the requisite cardiac structure segmentation. However, the lack of robustness of deep learning models has hindered their widespread clinical adoption. Due to differences in the data characteristics, neural networks trained on data from a specific scanner are not guaranteed to generalise well to data acquired at a different centre or with a different scanner. In this work, we propose a principled solution to the problem of this domain shift. Domain-adversarial learning is used to train a domain-invariant 2D U-Net using labelled and unlabelled data. This approach is evaluated on both seen and unseen domains from the MMs challenge dataset and the domain-adversarial approach shows improved performance as compared to standard training. Additionally, we show that the domain information cannot be recovered from the learned features.
Astronomers have captured the first-ever image of a black hole, located in Messier 87, a galaxy around 55 million light-years away. The black hole is several billion times the size of our Sun and the picture shows it releasing a jet of energy 5,000 light-years into space. A telescope as big as Earth, combining data from radio telescopes located across the planet, was used to create the image. The data obtained was too large to transmit over the internet and needed to be physically transported by hard drives. From the image, scientists were able to calculate the size of the black hole. Observations of the black hole in Messier 87 will continue and the data will be used to confirm theories and hypotheses regarding black holes

Apple has been granted a patent for software that generates synthetic group selfies. The software is likely a method for taking group selfies for social media even during social distancing. Users would be able to invite others to take part in a group selfie and the software would then arrange the images together into a single picture. The resulting picture will be customizable, so users should be able to modify the position of the people in the photo or store the original images separately. Apple first filed for the patent in 2018 and it was just granted at the beginning of June.

The main objective of this paper is to define a logic for reasoning about distributed time-stamped claims. Such a logic is interesting for theoretical reasons, i.e., as a logic per se , but also because it has a number of practical applications, in particular when one needs to reason about a huge amount of pieces of evidence collected from different sources, where some of the pieces of evidence may be contradictory and some sources are considered to be more trustworthy than others. We introduce the Time-Stamped Claim Logic including a sound and complete sequent calculus that allows one to reduce the size of the collected set of evidence and removes inconsistencies, i.e., the logic ensures that the result is consistent with respect to the trust relations considered. In order to show how Time-Stamped Claim Logic can be used in practice, we consider a concrete cyber-attribution case study. Keywords: Time-stamped claim logic, labelled deduction, Gentzen calculus, evidence logic, cyber security.

Nanomedic Technologies, an Israeli startup, has created a portable device that can create a temporary and transparent skin layer that can be applied to patients without touching the wound. The device uses a patented electrospinning technology which creates nanofibers by applying a strong electric field to polymer solutions which then knit together in layers to form a nanofibrous mat that mimics skin. The polymer solution can be combined with antibacterial creams, antibiotics, collagen, silicon, hydrogel, or cannabinoids, depending on the patient's needs. Treatment is fast, and patients can take showers after only 2 days without the need to redress the wound. The device is set to launch in the second half of 2019.
Fourier phase retrieval is a classical problem that deals with the recovery of an image from the amplitude measurements of its Fourier coefficients. Conventional methods solve this problem via iterative (alternating) minimization by leveraging some prior knowledge about the structure of the unknown image. The inherent ambiguities about shift and flip in the Fourier measurements make this problem especially difficult; and most of the existing methods use several random restarts with different permutations. In this paper, we assume that a known (learned) reference is added to the signal before capturing the Fourier amplitude measurements. Our method is inspired by the principle of adding a reference signal in holography. To recover the signal, we implement an iterative phase retrieval method as an unrolled network. Then we use back propagation to learn the reference that provides us the best reconstruction for a fixed number of phase retrieval iterations. We performed a number of simulations on a variety of datasets under different conditions and found that our proposed method for phase retrieval via unrolled network and learned reference provides near-perfect recovery at fixed (small) computational cost. We compared our method with standard Fourier phase retrieval methods and observed significant performance enhancement using the learned reference. Our code is available at

As location-based techniques and applications become ubiquitous in emerging wireless networks, the verification of location information will become of growing importance. This has led in recent years to an explosion of activity related to location verification techniques in wireless networks, with a specific focus on Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) being evident. Such focus is largely due to the mission-critical nature of vehicle location verification within the ITS scenario. In this work we review recent research in wireless location verification related to the vehicular network scenario. We particularly focus on location verification systems that rely on formal mathematical classification frameworks, showing how many systems are either partially or fully encompassed by such frameworks.

LIDAR (light detection and ranging) is an optical remote-sensing technique that measures the distance between sensor and object, and the reflected energy from the object. Over the years, LIDAR data has been used as the primary source of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). DEMs have been used in a variety of applications like road extraction, hydrological modeling, flood mapping, and surface analysis. A number of studies in flooding suggest the usage of high- resolution DEMs as inputs in the applications improve the overall reliability and accuracy. Despite the importance of high-resolution DEM, many areas in the United States and the world do not have access to high-resolution DEM due to technological limitations or the cost of the data collection. With recent development in Graphical Processing Units (GPU) and novel algorithms, deep learning techniques have become attractive to researchers for their performance in learning features from high-resolution datasets. Numerous new methods have been proposed such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create intelligent models that correct and augment large-scale datasets. In this paper, a GAN based model is developed and evaluated, inspired by single image super-resolution methods, to increase the spatial resolution of a given DEM dataset up to 4 times without additional information related to data.
A tweet promoting a TorrentFreak article regarding leaked episodes from unreleased shows was hit with a DMCA takedown, a move which the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) complained about. The EFF tweet complaining about the takedown was also served with a DMCA takedown request. In the original article, TorrentFreak used screenshots from the leaked shows to prove that they were screener copies of the shows. The EFF claimed that this was fair use and not copyright infringement, as TorrentFreak was only reporting on the infringement. Twitter receives around 10,000 DMCA requests per month, and this is an example of how the takedown system can be abused.

In machine learning based single image super-resolution, the degradation model is embedded in training data generation. However, most existing satellite image super-resolution methods use a simple down-sampling model with a fixed kernel to create training images. These methods work fine on synthetic data, but do not perform well on real satellite images. We propose a realistic training data generation model for commercial satellite imagery products, which includes not only the imaging process on satellites but also the post-process on the ground. We also propose a convolutional neural network optimized for satellite images. Experiments show that the proposed training data generation model is able to improve super-resolution performance on real satellite images.

Microfluidic devices are utilized to control and direct flow behavior in a wide variety of applications, particularly in medical diagnostics. A particularly popular form of microfluidics - called inertial microfluidic flow sculpting - involves placing a sequence of pillars to controllably deform an initial flow field into a desired one. Inertial flow sculpting can be formally defined as an inverse problem, where one identifies a sequence of pillars (chosen, with replacement, from a finite set of pillars, each of which produce a specific transformation) whose composite transformation results in a user-defined desired transformation. Endemic to most such problems in engineering, inverse problems are usually quite computationally intractable, with most traditional approaches based on search and optimization strategies. In this paper, we pose this inverse problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. We train a DoubleDQN agent to learn from this environment. The results suggest that learning is possible using a DoubleDQN model with the success frequency reaching 90 in 200,000 episodes and the rewards converging. While most of the results are obtained by fixing a particular target flow shape to simplify the learning problem, we later demonstrate how to transfer the learning of an agent based on one target shape to another, i.e. from one design to another and thus be useful for a generic design of a flow shape.
We investigate a new method for injecting backdoors into machine learning models, based on poisoning the loss computation in the model-training code. Our attack is blind: the attacker cannot modify the training data, nor observe the execution of his code, nor access the resulting model. We develop a new technique for blind backdoor training using multi-objective optimization to achieve high accuracy on both the main and backdoor tasks while evading all known defenses. We then demonstrate the efficacy of the blind attack with new classes of backdoors strictly more powerful than those in prior literature: single-pixel backdoors in ImageNet models, backdoors that switch the model to a different, complex task, and backdoors that do not require inference-time input modifications. Finally, we discuss defenses.
Scientists have genetically engineered a plant with a visible glow that lasts for the duration of the plant's life cycle. The modified tobacco plants don't need to be fed with chemicals to maintain luminescence. A timelapse video of the plants growing is available in the articles. The scientists used the DNA of bioluminescent fungi to create the plants. Younger parts of the plants glow most brightly, with the flowers glowing brightest. The plants do not emit enough light to read by, but enough to be clearly visible.
We present a novel approach of creating face makeup upon a face image with another images as the style examples. Our approach is analogous to physical makeup, as we modify the color and skin details while preserving the face structure. More precisely, we extract image foregrounds from both subject and multiple example images. Then by using image matting algorithms, the system extracts the semantic information such as faces, lips, teeth, eyes, eyebrows, etc., from the extracted foregrounds of both subject and multiple example images. And, then the makeup style is transferred between the corresponding parts with the same semantic information. Next we get the face makeup transferred result by seamlessly compositing different parts together using alpha blending. In the final step, we present an efficient method of makeup consistency to optimize the color of a collection of images showing the common scene. The main advantage of our method over existing techniques is that it does not need face matching, as one could use more than one example images. Because one example image does not fulfill the complete requirements of a user. Our algorithm is not restricted to head shot images as we can also change the makeup style in the wild. Moreover, our algorithm does not require to choose the same pose and image size between subject and example images. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in faithfully transferring makeup.

One of the limitations of machine learning is the large amount of time it takes to train models. Some models can take up to six weeks to train, restricting the number of tests that data scientists can perform every year. A new chip by Cerebras is able to perform significantly better in both speed and efficiency compared with any other current system. The Wafer Scale Engine chip is 50 times the size of the largest GPU at 46,266 square millimeters. It has 1.2 trillion transistors, 400,000 processor cores, 18 gigabytes of SRAM, and interconnects capable of moving 100 million billion bits per second. Some of these chips have already been deployed. Previous attempts at creating wafer-scale chips have failed.
Despite recent progress on semantic segmentation, there still exist huge challenges in medical ultra-resolution image segmentation. The methods based on multi-branch structure can make a good balance between computational burdens and segmentation accuracy. However, the fusion structure in these methods require to be designed elaborately to achieve desirable result, which leads to model redundancy. In this paper, we propose Meta Segmentation Network (MSN) to solve this challenging problem. With the help of meta-learning, the fusion module of MSN is quite simple but effective. MSN can fast generate the weights of fusion layers through a simple meta-learner, requiring only a few training samples and epochs to converge. In addition, to avoid learning all branches from scratch, we further introduce a particular weight sharing mechanism to realize a fast knowledge adaptation and share the weights among multiple branches, resulting in the performance improvement and significant parameters reduction. The experimental results on two challenging ultra-resolution medical datasets BACH and ISIC show that MSN achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful approach for seeking the global optimum of expensive black-box functions and has proven successful for fine tuning hyper-parameters of machine learning models. The Bayesian optimization routine involves learning a response surface and maximizing a score to select the most valuable inputs to be queried at the next iteration. These key steps are subject to the curse of dimensionality so that Bayesian optimization does not scale beyond 10-20 parameters. In this work, we address this issue and propose a high-dimensional BO method that learns a nonlinear low-dimensional manifold of the input space. We achieve this with a multi-layer neural network embedded in the covariance function of a Gaussian process. This approach applies unsupervised dimensionality reduction as a byproduct of a supervised regression solution. This also allows exploiting data efficiency of Gaussian process models in a Bayesian framework. We also introduce a nonlinear mapping from the manifold to the high-dimensional space based on multi-output Gaussian processes and jointly train it end-to-end via marginal likelihood maximization. We show this intrinsically low-dimensional optimization outperforms recent baselines in high-dimensional BO literature on a set of benchmark functions in 60 dimensions.
OpenAI has released the full version of GPT-2, a text-generating AI system. When it was first announced, there were concerns that it could be misused to spread fake news, spam, and disinformation. OpenAI has since released smaller versions of GPT-2, but has seen no strong evidence of misuse. GPT-2 can generate coherent text from minimal prompts, for example, it can create an article from just a headline. Its limitations include having trouble with long-term coherence, for example, sticking to a single subject in a news article. There is an ongoing debate with AI researchers about the ethics of releasing cutting-edge AI tools that can enable malicious actors. OpenAI has created systems that can spot GPT-2's output with around 95 percent accuracy. A link to a web version of GPT-2 is available.

He has posted six videos making fun of Facebook since he was dismissed on August 26. In these videos, he criticizes the work culture, calling it a popularity contest where ideas and projects are driven by likes and comments rather than logic. Shyu had been working at Facebook since May 2018 and had previously worked at Google for four years. He currently makes well over 500,000 through his YouTube videos.
Bonnie loved fall flowers. Mums were her favorite. She bought several large containers of them. When she put them in her porch, her face lit up. It was great to have her fall decorating done!
Cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has become the gold standard for the non-invasive evaluation of cardiac function. In particular, it allows the accurate quantification of functional parameters including the chamber volumes and ejection fraction. Deep learning has shown the potential to automate the requisite cardiac structure segmentation. However, the lack of robustness of deep learning models has hindered their widespread clinical adoption. Due to differences in the data characteristics, neural networks trained on data from a specific scanner are not guaranteed to generalise well to data acquired at a different centre or with a different scanner. In this work, we propose a principled solution to the problem of this domain shift. Domain-adversarial learning is used to train a domain-invariant 2D U-Net using labelled and unlabelled data. This approach is evaluated on both seen and unseen domains from the MMs challenge dataset and the domain-adversarial approach shows improved performance as compared to standard training. Additionally, we show that the domain information cannot be recovered from the learned features.

Nanoscale devices can be difficult to study and improve as they're too small to reflect enough light to be viewed clearly. Researchers from UC Riverside have built a device that squeezes tungsten lamp light into a 6-nanometer spot at the end of a silver nanowire to produce color imaging at an unprecedented level. The system records changes in beam shape and color as the nanowire's tip passes over objects. It is able to create color photos of carbon nanotubes. The technology could play an important role in developing more uniform nanomaterials and help improve other areas of research where this level of resolution hasn't been available.
Nanomedic Technologies, an Israeli startup, has created a portable device that can create a temporary and transparent skin layer that can be applied to patients without touching the wound. The device uses a patented electrospinning technology which creates nanofibers by applying a strong electric field to polymer solutions which then knit together in layers to form a nanofibrous mat that mimics skin. The polymer solution can be combined with antibacterial creams, antibiotics, collagen, silicon, hydrogel, or cannabinoids, depending on the patient's needs. Treatment is fast, and patients can take showers after only 2 days without the need to redress the wound. The device is set to launch in the second half of 2019.
Japanese researchers have developed electronic chopsticks that enhance salty tastes. The chopsticks use a weak electrical current to transmit sodium ions from food to enhance the taste of salt by 1.5 times. The chopsticks could help people lower their salt intake. Excess sodium consumption is related to high blood pressure, strokes, and other diseases. The chopsticks could be on the market as early as next year.
Process mining techniques focus on extracting insight in processes from event logs. Process mining has the potential to provide valuable insights in (un) healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions when applied on data from smart home environments. However, events recorded in smart home environments are on the level of sensor triggers, at which process discovery algorithms produce overgeneralizing process models that allow for too much behavior and that are difficult to interpret for human experts. We show that abstracting the events to a higher-level interpretation can enable discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models. We present a framework for the extraction of features that can be used for abstraction with supervised learning methods that is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. This framework can automatically abstract sensor-level events to their interpretation at the human activity level, after training it on training data for which both the sensor and human activity events are known. We demonstrate our abstraction framework on three real-life smart home event logs and show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction are more precise indeed.
Vuity is an eye drop that reduces pupil size, allowing people with age-related blurred near vision to see clearly without reading glasses for up to 10 hours. It was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The drops cost about 80 for a 30-day supply and are not covered by medical insurance. There are side effects such as headaches and red eyes. The drops should not be used while driving at night or when performing activities in low-light conditions.
The last decade has seen an unprecedented growth in artificial intelligence and photonic technologies, both of which drive the limits of modern-day computing devices. In line with these recent developments, this work brings together the state of the art of both fields within the framework of reinforcement learning. We present the blueprint for a photonic implementation of an active learning machine incorporating contemporary algorithms such as SARSA, Q-learning, and projective simulation. We numerically investigate its performance within typical reinforcement learning environments, showing that realistic levels of experimental noise can be tolerated or even be beneficial for the learning process. Remarkably, the architecture itself enables mechanisms of abstraction and generalization, two features which are often considered key ingredients for artificial intelligence. The proposed architecture, based on single-photon evolution on a mesh of tunable beamsplitters, is simple, scalable, and a first integration in portable systems appears to be within the reach of near-term technology.
Massive MIMO is seen as a main enabler for low-latency communications, thanks to its high spatial degrees of freedom. The channel hardening and favorable propagation properties of Massive MIMO are particularly important for multiplexing several URLLC devices. However, the actual utility of channel hardening and spatial multiplexing is dependent critically on the accuracy of channel knowledge. When several low-latency devices are multiplexed, the cost for acquiring accurate knowledge becomes critical, and it is not evident how many devices can be served with a latency-reliability requirement and how many pilot symbols should be allocated. This paper investigates the trade-off between achieving high spectral efficiency and high reliability in the downlink, by employing various power allocation strategies, for maximum ratio and minimum mean square error precoders. The results show that using max-min SINR power allocation achieves the best reliability, at the expense of lower sum spectral efficiency.
State-of-the-art pedestrian detection models have achieved great success in many benchmarks. However, these models require lots of annotation information and the labeling process usually takes much time and efforts. In this paper, we propose a method to generate labeled pedestrian data and adopt them to support the training of pedestrian detectors. The proposed framework is built on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with multiple discriminators, trying to synthesize realistic pedestrians and learn the background context simultaneously. To handle the pedestrians of different sizes, we adopt the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer in the discriminator. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks. The results show that our framework can smoothly synthesize pedestrians on background images of variations and different levels of details. To quantitatively evaluate our approach, we add the generated samples into training data of the baseline pedestrian detectors and show the synthetic images are able to improve the detectors' performance. 1 1 footnote 1 the code is available at
Electric Vehicle charging is a hassle, causing one-fifth of all EV buyers to go back to gas vehicles. Researchers at Cornell University have developed a technology that can charge vehicles on the road while in motion. The technology can be installed on highways, creating charging lanes so that there would be no need to stop to charge or fuel up. It will be a while before the technology will be seen on roads, if ever. Toyota is working with the research team to use the system to charge electric forklifts.

We generalize the notions of singularities and ordinary points from linear ordinary differential equations to D-finite systems. Ordinary points of a D-finite system are characterized in terms of its formal power series solutions. We also show that apparent singularities can be removed like in the univariate case by adding suitable additional solutions to the system at hand. Several algorithms are presented for removing and detecting apparent singularities. In addition, an algorithm is given for computing formal power series solutions of a D-finite system at apparent singularities.
